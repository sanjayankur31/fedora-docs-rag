- Fedora Licensing Guidelines = License Approval

# Overview {#_overview}

In order to meet the goal of creating a complete, general purpose
operating system exclusively from free and open source software, all
software and other content made available by Fedora must be under
licenses determined to be allowed in Fedora, with only limited,
conditional exceptions.

Fedora applies different license approval criteria for different
categories of material: code, documentation, content, fonts, and
firmware. The corresponding status names for approved licenses are:
*allowed*, *allowed-documentation*, *allowed-content*, *allowed-fonts*,
and *allowed-firmware*. The strictest license approval standards apply
to code, while somewhat relaxed standards apply to the other categories.
Licenses that are not allowed for any category are classified as
*not-allowed*.

:::: important
::: title
:::

Fedora's license approval standards apply to everything that is made
available by the Fedora Project, not just installable binary packages in
Fedora Linux. For example, everything available at [Fedora
Pagure](https://pagure.io), [Fedora Source
Packages](https://src.fedoraproject.org), [Fedora
Koji](https://koji.fedoraproject.org), [Fedora
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org) and [Copr
repositories](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/) is subject to the same
licensing rules as Fedora Linux packages.
::::

The Fedora legal documentation includes lists of
[allowed](allowed-licenses.xml) and
[not-allowed](not-allowed-licenses.xml) licenses for Fedora. These lists
are generated from the data maintained in the [Fedora License
Data](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data) repository.
In case of any discrepancy between the generated Fedora license lists
and the data in Fedora License Data, the latter is considered
authoritative. For some purposes you may find it more useful to refer to
the repository (particularly the TOML files in the `data/` directory),
rather than the generated lists.

Fedora uses [SPDX license expressions](spdx.xml) to represent allowed
and not-allowed licenses in TOML files in the Fedora License Data
`data/` directory and in the generated Fedora license lists.

If a license that covers something in Fedora, or in a package that has
been or is intended to be proposed for inclusion in Fedora Linux, is not
listed on the allowed and not-allowed lists, then it must be
[reviewed](license-review-process.xml).

Whether a license is allowed or not allowed for Fedora is ultimately
determined by the Fedora Council. Today, this decision is normally
delegated to members of the Red Hat legal team who are specialists in
free software / open source licensing and who are very familiar with and
committed to supporting Fedora's [mission and
foundations](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/).

# Allowed Licenses {#_allowed_licenses}

A license is *allowed* if Fedora determines that the license is a free
software / open source license. At a high level, the inquiry involves
determining whether the license provides software freedom, and
(equivalently) making sure that the license does not place burdens on
users\' exercise of its permissions that are inconsistent with evolving
community norms and traditions around what is acceptable in a free
software / open source license.

As a general rule, all code made available by Fedora must be governed by
an *allowed* license. A license that is in the general *allowed*
category can be used for anything in Fedora, not just code.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

Fedora treats spec files as \"code\". Normally, spec files have no
explicit license, and, to the extent they were authored by Fedora
contributors and are copyrightable, they are available under the MIT
license by virtue of the
[FPCA](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/fpca/).
::::

# Licenses Allowed for Documentation {#_licenses_allowed_for_documentation}

Fedora will designate a license as allowed for documentation
(*allowed-documentation*) if it meets the criteria for *allowed*
licenses and it seems to be specifically designed for documentation and
not for code.

In addition, Fedora classifies the following licenses as
*allowed-documentation* (even though they do not meet the above
criteria):

- Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License and its
  predecessor versions

- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
  License and its predecessor versions

- The GNU Free Documentation License version 2.1 and its predecessor
  versions

# Licenses Allowed for Content {#_licenses_allowed_for_content}

For purposes of Fedora license classification, "content" means any
material that is not clearly code, documentation, fonts or firmware.
Here are some examples of content:

- graphic image files

- audio files

- nonfunctional data sets

- AppStream metainfo.xml files

- standards documents

- certain files relating to functionality and management of markup
  languages, including XML schema files and resource resolution files,
  XSL files, SGML declaration files, and ancillary informal
  documentation accompanying such files

- checkpoints or comparable machine learning model files containing
  trained parameters

- non-script slide presentation resources, except to the extent slide
  presentation content functions as documentation

- game engine package files that contain game data

Fedora will designate a license as allowed for content
(*allowed-content*) if it meets the criteria for *allowed* licenses with
the following exceptions:

- The license may restrict or prohibit modification

- The license may say that it does not cover patents or grant any patent
  licenses

:::: tip
::: title
:::

When we say that a standards document is subject to the relaxed license
criteria for content, we are referring to the copyright-oriented license
for the document itself, not licenses covering implementation of the
technology specified by the document.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
:::

Man pages are considered documentation, not content, even when they are
derived from standards documents.
::::

:::: important
::: title
:::

`CC0-1.0`, which has a clause that says that it does not license or
otherwise \"affect\" patent rights, is no longer *allowed*, but it
continues to be *allowed-content*.
::::

Fedora's decision to treat a particular category of material as
\"content\" generally reflects a pragmatic judgment. The main focus for
Fedora is free software; in some cases, for free software to be fully
useful, it must be accompanied by non-software items that unfortunately
are covered by non-libre terms. Fedora may be more likely to conclude
that a given category of material is \"content\" if such material is (as
a general matter) likely of doubtful or \"thin\" copyrightability.

# Licenses Allowed for Fonts {#_licenses_allowed_for_fonts}

Fedora may designate a license as allowed for fonts (*allowed-fonts*) if
it meets the criteria for *allowed* licenses with the following
exception:

- The license may contain a nominal prohibition on resale or
  distribution in isolation

In addition, Fedora classifies the following licenses as *allowed-fonts*
(even though at least some of them do not meet the above criteria):

- Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License and its
  predecessor versions

- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
  License and its predecessor versions

A good example of what we mean by a \"nominal prohibition on resale or
distribution in isolation\" is found in the following condition in the
[SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html):

`Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.`

This kind of prohibition would not be acceptable in a license applicable
to code (see, for example, the [Sun RPC
license](https://spot.livejournal.com/315383.html)).

:::: note
::: title
:::

The prohibition in the SIL OFL is \"nominal\" because in FOSS legal
culture it has occasionally been cleverly asserted that one can get
around this kind of provision by bundling a trivial \'Hello world\'
program with the fonts (and there is actually some reason to believe the
authors of the SIL OFL intended this). If we were to encounter a license
that had such a provision but we believed a \'Hello world\' solution was
not even arguably viable, we might not consider the license allowable
for fonts.
::::

# Licenses Allowed for Firmware {#_licenses_allowed_for_firmware}

Some applications, drivers, and hardware require binary firmware images
to boot Fedora Linux or function properly. Fedora permits inclusion of
these files as long as they meet the following license and technical
requirements:

## License requirements for firmware {#_license_requirements_for_firmware}

Fedora may designate a license as allowed for firmware
(*allowed-firmware*) if it meets the criteria for *allowed* licenses
with the following exceptions:

- The license may prohibit modification, reverse engineering,
  disassembly or decompilation.

- The license may require that the firmware be used only in conjunction
  with specified hardware.

- The license may require that the firmware be redistributed only as
  incorporated in the redistributor's product (or as a maintenance
  update for existing end users of the redistributor's product). This
  may be limited further to those products of the redistributor that
  support or contain the hardware associated with the licensed firmware.

- The license may require a redistributor to pass on or impose
  conditions on users that are no more restrictive than those authorized
  by Fedora itself with respect to firmware licenses.

## Technical firmware requirements {#_technical_firmware_requirements}

While these technical requirements for firmware have nothing to do with
licensing, they are included here for convenience.

- The files must be non-executable within the Fedora Linux context
  (note: this means that the files cannot run on their own, not that
  they are just `chmod -x`)

- The files must not be libraries, within the Fedora Linux context

- The files must be standalone, not embedded in executable or library
  code (within the Fedora Linux context)

- The files must be necessary for the functionality of open source code
  being included in Fedora Linux or to enable Fedora Linux to boot on a
  specific device, where no other reliable and supported mechanisms
  exist

# \'Not allowed\' Licenses {#_not_allowed_licenses}

Any license that does not meet the criteria above for allowed licenses
(including allowed for a specific category) will be classified as
*not-allowed*.

:::: note
::: title
:::

In extremely rare cases we may have some reason to designate a license
as *not-allowed* even though it might meet the formal criteria for the
relevant category. An example is
[`LicenseRef-wrk`](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/data/LicenseRef-wrk.toml?ref_type=heads),
which represents a license based on the Apache License 2.0 and named
\"Modified Apache License 2.0\", presumably without permission from the
Apache Software Foundation, which has said that derivatives of the
Apache License cannot have \"Apache\" in their name.
::::

## `usage` exceptions {#_usage_exceptions}

For some *not-allowed* licenses, or licenses allowed only for a specific
category, an exception is recorded in the Fedora License Data TOML file
for the license, as the value of the `usage` key (and displayed in the
\"Usage\" column of the [not-allowed](not-allowed-licenses.xml) list).
The exception will indicate that Fedora tolerates the license under
limited conditions (for example, for a specific package, or for a
defined time period).

For example, here is the `usage` exception for `OPUBL-1.0`:

::: informalexample
Allowed for documentation if the copyright holder does not exercise any
of the "LICENSE OPTIONS" listed in Section VI
:::

:::: note
::: title
:::

`OPUBL-1.0` represents the Open Publication License version 1.0, which
was classified as \"good\" for documentation under the Callaway system
provided no \"options\" are exercised. For administrative convenience we
now classify it as *not-allowed* with the `usage` exception noted above.
::::

# Changes in License Status {#_changes_in_license_status}

Fedora aims for stability in its license classifications, but its
treatment of a particular license or license type may change as
community standards and expectations around acceptable licensing evolve
or as new issues and concerns come to light. In rare cases, an allowed
license may be reclassified as *not-allowed*, or an *allowed* license
may be reclassified as allowed only for a specific category of material,
as when `CC0-1.0` was reclassified from *allowed* to *allowed-content*.
When this sort of reclassification is done, we will try to minimize
disruption, including by defining appropriate `usage` exceptions.

# Background to Fedora licensing policy {#_background_to_fedora_licensing_policy}

Over several decades, norms concerning acceptable standards for software
(and other content) licensing developed out of communities associated
with free software and open source projects. Fedora builds upon and
contributes to the development of this community tradition. Most of the
philosophical and practical groundwork for Fedora's policies on
licensing was developed over many years by [Tom \'spot\'
Callaway](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Spot), often working in
collaboration with members of Red Hat's legal team.

The two most influential efforts to distill FOSS licensing norms are the
Free Software Foundation's maintenance and interpretation of the [Free
Software
Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#fs-definition),
and the Open Source Initiative's maintenance and interpretation of the
[Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd). For much of its
earlier history, Fedora tended to regard the FSF's interpretation as
highly authoritative, while viewing the OSI's license review decisions
with greater skepticism. However, even at the high point of that period
of skepticism, Fedora treated the OSD and OSI decisions as one source of
persuasive authority. Fedora has also sometimes taken into account the
decisions of other major community Linux distributions and other
important community efforts to define and apply software freedom-related
legal norms. Fedora's license approval decisions are both principled and
pragmatic.

Out of necessity, Fedora has passed judgment on hundreds of licenses
never considered by the FSF or the OSI. In a small number of cases,
Fedora has disagreed with decisions of the FSF and OSI regarding whether
particular licenses are FOSS. Over time, Fedora has built up an informal
body of interpretation and policymaking regarding free/open licensing
which has itself influenced the larger FOSS community outside of Fedora.

# SPDX License Expressions {#_spdx_license_expressions}

This page provides an introduction to SPDX license expressions with a
focus on how they are used in Fedora.

## Overview {#_overview_2}

[SPDX](https://spdx.dev) (Software Package Data Exchange) is a standard
format for communicating the component and metadata information
associated with software packages. The three aspects of SPDX that are
most relevant to Fedora are:

- The [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses): Focusing on
  commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free/open or
  collaborative software, data and documentation, this list features
  standardized short identifiers for referring to licenses and
  exceptions.

- The [SPDX license expression
  grammar](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/spdx-license-expressions/).

- The [SPDX matching
  guidelines](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/):
  Multiple real-world license texts will \"match\" a given SPDX License
  List license or exception identifier in accordance with these
  guidelines.

Fedora uses SPDX license expressions primarily for two distinct though
related purposes:

- To classify and organize the data pertaining to allowed and
  not-allowed licenses, as maintained in the Fedora License Data
  repository and the Fedora license lists that are generated from it.

- To populate License tags in spec files.

## Types of SPDX License Expressions {#_types_of_spdx_license_expressions}

### SPDX License List Identifiers {#_spdx_license_list_identifiers}

Commonly called \"SPDX identifiers\", these are the short form
identifiers contained in the SPDX License List. Examples: `MIT`,
`GPL-2.0-or-later`.

### Custom-defined License Identifiers (`LicenseRef-`) {#_custom_defined_license_identifiers_licenseref}

A custom-defined license identifier (i.e., not contained in the SPDX
License List) may be formed using the `LicenseRef-` prefix). Currently
in Fedora License Data all `LicenseRef-` identifiers are defined
specifically by Fedora (i.e., there is no use of `LicenseRef-`
identifiers from other projects or organizations). Note that SPDX
currently has no official system of namespacing for `LicenseRef-`
identifiers.

Most Fedora `LicenseRef-` identifiers represent *not-allowed* licenses.
Examples: `LicenseRef-sun-rpc`, `LicenseRef-OpenMotif`. However, some
represent allowed licenses. Examples include the umbrella identifiers
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` and
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`.

### `WITH` Expressions {#_with_expressions}

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by following an SPDX identifier
with the `WITH` operator, followed by an exception identifier contained
in the [SPDX Exceptions
List](https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html). This is intended
to signify the supplementing of a license grant with a permissive
exception or additional permission, which most commonly occurs with
licenses in the GPL family. Some examples:
`GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic`,
`Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception`.

In theory, `WITH` can also follow a `LicenseRef-` identifier, but there
are no examples of this in Fedora License Data. (There is one unusual
`LicenseRef-` that incorporates `WITH` in the identifier:
`LicenseRef-GPL-2.0-or-later-WITH-UPX`.) SPDX 3.0 added an
`AdditionRef-` construct to the SPDX expression grammar, which permits
custom-defined identifiers that can follow `WITH`. `WITH AdditionRef-`
expressions may be used for additional terms of all types, not just
permissive exceptions.

### `OR` Expressions {#_or_expressions}

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by joining two SPDX expressions
with the `OR` operator. This is intended to signify a choice of
licenses. In FOSS, a choice of exactly two licenses is often called
\"dual licensing\", although that term is sometimes used to refer to
different concepts. Examples: `Apache-2.0 OR MIT` (a common form of
licensing of Rust crates),
`MPL-1.1 OR GPL-2.0-or-later OR LGPL-2.1-or-later` (historically known
as the Mozilla tri-license).

### `AND` Expressions {#_and_expressions}

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by joining two SPDX expressions
with the `AND` operator. This generally signifies that both
sub-expressions apply to different parts of a file or package. Example:
`LGPL-2.1-or-later AND GPL-2.0-or-later AND MIT`

### `+` Operator {#_operator}

The postfix
`` ` operator applied to an SPDX identifier signifies permission to use later versions of the license. Example: `LPPL-1.3a ``.
Use of `+` is uncommon in Fedora License Data.

:::: note
::: title
:::

At the Free Software Foundation's request, the use of `+` with GPL
family license identifiers has been deprecated by SPDX in favor of the
use of `-only` and `-or-later` identifier variants (for example,
`GPL-2.0-only` and `GPL-2.0-or-later`).
::::

## SPDX License Expressions in Fedora License Data {#_spdx_license_expressions_in_fedora_license_data}

Each item in Fedora's lists of allowed and not-allowed licenses is an
SPDX license expression that is associated with a specific TOML file in
the `data/` directory of the Fedora License Data repository. Each TOML
file has an `expression` key whose value is a string containing an SPDX
license expression. That SPDX expression forms the base name of the TOML
file, except that internal whitespace is represented with an underscore.
For example, the `MIT.toml` file contains `expression = "MIT"`, and the
`GPL-2.0-only_WITH_Linux-syscall-note.toml` file contains
`expression = "GPL-2.0-only WITH Linux-syscall-note"`.

`AND` expressions and, with one exception, `OR` expressions, are not
appropriate for Fedora License Data. (They may, and commonly do, appear
in [spec file License tags](license-field.xml).)

The exception is certain `OR` expressions representing a dual license
that consists of a GPL-family license and the Perl 5 Artistic 1.0
license (\~ `Artistic-1.0-Perl`). Currently two of these are included in
Fedora License Data: `GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl` and
`GPL-2.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

This exception is designed to facilitate the use of these `OR`
expressions in spec file License tags for Perl packages, a preference of
Fedora Perl package maintainers and upstream Perl module maintainers
despite the fact that `Artistic-1.0-Perl` is *not-allowed*. The normal
rule in Fedora is that if a license grant is representable by an `OR`
expression that includes an allowed license and a license that is *not
allowed*, only the allowed license should be included in a spec file
License tag.
::::

## SPDX Matching Guidelines {#_spdx_matching_guidelines}

SPDX License List identifiers are templates (specified in XML files
maintained in the [license-list-XML
repository](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/tree/main/src)).
Many of the XML files make use of regular expressions and designate
portions of license text as optional. Multiple real-world license texts
may *match* an SPDX identifier in a sense that is defined in detail in
the [matching
guidelines](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/)
contained in the SPDX specification. Not all of the matching guidelines
are implemented in the XML files.

In using SPDX identifiers and `LicenseRef-` identifiers, Fedora aims to
apply the SPDX matching guidelines to the extent they are meaningful or
applicable to the Fedora context.

## SPDX License Expressions in License Tags {#_spdx_license_expressions_in_license_tags}

A [separate page](license-field.xml) provides a detailed discussion of
the use of SPDX expressions in spec file License tags.

# License Review Process {#_license_review_process}

If you find a license that covers part of a Fedora package, a proposed
Fedora package, or some other Fedora Project artifact, that is not
listed in the [allowed](allowed-licenses.xml) or
[not-allowed](not-allowed-licenses.xml) license lists, please submit the
license for review. Licenses are classified as allowed, allowed for
certain types of material, or not allowed for inclusion in Fedora as
discussed in [License Approval](license-approval.xml).

Fedora has adopted the use of SPDX expressions along with the SPDX
matching guidelines as a standard system for representing and
classifying licenses. In most cases where a license is classified as
allowed, Fedora prefers to use standard SPDX license identifiers
(contained in the SPDX License List) rather than custom-defined
identifiers.

The license review process typically involves these three steps:

1.  Open a [fedora-license-data
    issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues)
    for review of a license.

2.  Open an [SPDX
    license-list-XML](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues)
    issue (usually to request addition of an identifier for the license
    to the SPDX License List). This step is not needed if the license
    matches to a license already on the SPDX License List or if the
    license is determined to be *not-allowed*.

3.  Once Fedora has decided how to classify the license, open a [merge
    request](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/merge_requests)
    to add a TOML file for the license at fedora-license-data.

The first step is typically initiated by a Fedora package maintainer,
although any Fedora contributor is encouraged to request review of a
license. We prefer that the person who initiates the first step also
takes responsibility for the second and third steps, as this reduces the
burden on the Fedora License Data maintainers and makes the license
review process more efficient.

Community software licenses that are apparently intended as jokes
([examples](https://github.com/ErikMcClure/bad-licenses)) are generally
analyzed as though they were serious.

## Opening a Fedora License Data license review issue {#_opening_a_fedora_license_data_license_review_issue}

To request review of a license, you must be a Fedora contributor and
become part of the Fedora Gitlab group.

Open a [new
issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/new)
for Fedora License Data using the license review issue template. You
should ordinarily create one issue per license, rather than submit an
issue referencing multiple licenses for review.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

If you need general help with identifying the licenses that apply to an
entire package, we encourage you to submit an issue for this purpose. We
will apply the `package inquiry` label to such issues.
::::

Title the issue `License Review: <identifying name>`. (The issue
template function in Gitlab does not provide for an automatic issue
title.) For the \"identifying name\", use an SPDX identifier, if
applicable and known. If the license is not on the SPDX License List,
then use an official or commonly applied license name or a placeholder
identifier. In any case, something unique and identifiable makes it
easier to track issues in the repository. The vast majority of license
review issues use a placeholder name. This is usually not the identifier
that ends up being used to represent the license in Fedora License Data.

The license review issue template will ask you to provide the following
information:

- License name (required) --- you can use the \"identifying name\" that
  you used in the issue title, or \"None\" if you prefer

- Text of license (required) --- please provide a link to the license
  text or where it can be downloaded; also include the license text in a
  comment after creating the issue (particularly if it is relatively
  brief license)

- Fedora package name and link to upstream source code of the package
  (required)

- Is the license (or an exception, if your issue is requesting review of
  a `WITH` expression) on the [SPDX License
  List](https://spdx.org/licenses)? (required) --- if yes, then include
  the applicable SPDX license expression

- Reason for the license review (optional) --- for example, a link to
  the Bugzilla ticket for the package review

All discussion related to the license review will occur in the issue
thread and an official decision, based on application of the Fedora
[license approval criteria](license-approval.xml), will be noted there.
A decision may sometimes be noted solely by application of an
appropriate scoped label referring to the license classification.

### How to determine if a license or exception is on the SPDX License List {#_how_to_determine_if_a_license_or_exception_is_on_the_spdx_license_list}

The SPDX License List has an established set of
[guidelines](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/)
that define what constitutes a match to a
[license](https://spdx.org/licenses) or
[exception](https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html) on the SPDX
License List. This is intended to ensure that SPDX license identifiers
and expressions mean the same thing wherever they are used.

SPDX has some
[guidance](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md)
for how to detect and match license texts you find to licenses on the
SPDX License List.

You can also find information about various [license detection
tools](license-audit-tools.xml) in this documentation.

## Opening an SPDX License List issue {#_opening_an_spdx_license_list_issue}

If the Fedora License Data maintainers conclude that the license is
allowed, and they apply the `SPDX::submit issue` label, then the next
step is to [create an issue for the SPDX license-list-XML
repository](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md).
In most cases, the purpose of the issue is to request addition of a new
license identifier representing the license in the SPDX License List,
but it may also be to request a determination as to whether additional
markup can be added to an existing SPDX license to match to the license
you found. You do not need to determine this when you submit the issue.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

If the license does not seem to match an identifier already on the SPDX
License List, you do not have to wait for a Fedora License Data decision
on the license before opening an SPDX issue. Usually, however, an SPDX
issue is not opened until the Fedora License Data maintainers have
decided the license is allowed for Fedora.
::::

In addition to the required information, add a link to the related
Fedora License Data issue. If there has already been a Fedora decision
regarding the license please note that as well.

In some cases, the license you've found may not match an existing SPDX
license according to the SPDX matching guidelines, but it will be
sufficiently close that the SPDX legal team may determine that your
variant can be accommodated by revising the XML file for the existing
SPDX license in question. The Fedora License Data maintainers may
instruct you to create an SPDX License List issue for this purpose upon
their review.

If SPDX approves the license for inclusion as an identifier on the SPDX
License List, please help create the SPDX files for your submission in
accordance with the [SPDX license list
process](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md#accepted-license-process).

If you've submitted an SPDX issue before there is a decision on the
Fedora side, and the Fedora License Data maintainers later decide that
the license is *not-allowed*, you should offer to close the SPDX issue
if it is still pending.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

For allowed licenses, we want to use SPDX identifiers to represent the
license, and to request a new SPDX identifier if an applicable one does
not exist. For *not-allowed* licenses, we will use an SPDX identifier to
represent the license if it is already on the SPDX License List, but
otherwise we will create a `LicenseRef-` identifier to ensure all
license expressions in Fedora are valid with the SPDX Specification.
::::

The submission and approval process for inclusion on the SPDX License
List can be lengthy. As a temporary measure to mitigate delays in the
workflow, the Fedora Project will provision a temporary license
identifier with the syntax `LicenseRef-Fedora-Temporary-` that you may
use. Or `AdditionRef-Fedora-Temporary-` for exceptions. Once SPDX
assigns the final ID, you have to change this temporary ID to the final
one.

## Opening a Fedora License Data merge request {#_opening_a_fedora_license_data_merge_request}

Once (1) Fedora has made a decision to allow or not allow the license,
and (2) (if applicable) the SPDX License List process is also complete,
create a merge request to add a new TOML file for the license using the
[TOML file
format](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/master/TEMPLATE.toml)
according the determined status (*allowed*, *not-allowed*,
*allowed-fonts*, *allowed-documentation*, *allowed-content*,
*allowed-firmware*).

The TOML file corresponding to a given license contains an `expression`
key whose value must be a valid SPDX license expression, and the name of
the TOML file incorporates this SPDX expression (for example, the
`expression` value in the `MIT.toml` file is \"MIT\").

What SPDX license expression to use for a new Fedora License Data TOML
file depends on the Fedora classification of the license as well as how
(if at all) the license has been dealt with by SPDX. There are three
typical cases:

- If your license already matches an identifier on the SPDX License List
  (i.e., it was not necessary to create an SPDX License List issue), use
  that identifier as the expression in the new TOML file.

- If an SPDX License List issue was created, SPDX has decided to add
  your license as an identifier to the SPDX License List, and a pull
  request for your license submission has been merged in the [SPDX
  license-list-XML
  repository](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML), use this new
  SPDX identifier as the expression in the new TOML file.

- If Fedora has decided that the license is *not-allowed*, and the
  license does not match an identifier on the SPDX License List, use the
  SPDX `LicenseRef-` construct to create a custom-defined identifier for
  the license and use that identifier as the expression in the new TOML
  file.

There are special cases where Fedora may use a Fedora-defined
`LicenseRef-` identifier to represent an allowed license. Some of the
reasons why this may occur include:

- The license is believed to be unlikely to meet SPDX's license
  inclusion guidelines, so the Fedora License Data maintainers have
  indicated that an SPDX issue should not be created. This is expected
  to be fairly uncommon but may occur for some *allowed-content*
  licenses and most *allowed-firmware* licenses. For more info on
  *allowed-firmware*, see [Update Existing
  Packages](#update-existing-packages)

- An SPDX issue for an allowed license was created but SPDX ultimately
  decided not to add the license to the SPDX License List. This is
  expected to be very rare. Also, in cases where Fedora has a pressing
  need to publish an update to a spec file and SPDX hasn't completed its
  review, Fedora may temporarily use a `LicenseRef-`, to be replaced
  when SPDX adopts a new identifier for the license.

- The license qualifies to be covered by the umbrella license
  identifiers `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or
  `LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`. For more on these scenarios, see
  [Update Existing Packages](#update-existing-packages)

- The license could be represented with a complex composite SPDX license
  expression making use of one or more SPDX License List identifiers,
  but it is simpler to represent it with a `LicenseRef-` expression.
  These will generally be cases where there is also some benefit to the
  use of a `LicenseRef-` to signal that something is problematic about
  the license, even though Fedora has decided to allow it. For a good
  example, see the TOML file for
  [`LicenseRef-Bacula`](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/data/LicenseRef-Bacula.toml?ref_type=heads)
  and the related
  [issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/277).

- The license was classified as \"good\" under the (pre-SPDX) Callaway
  system, but is believed to no longer be present in supported releases
  of Fedora.

If a license given a `LicenseRef-` identifier is later identified as a
match to a license on the SPDX License List (for example, because of a
later addition to the SPDX License List), then the Fedora License Data
repository should ideally be updated by replacing the TOML file with a
new TOML file using the SPDX identifier.

:::: note
::: title
:::

In any case where a `LicenseRef-` is used, it is necessary to copy the
text of the license in the TOML file as the value of the `text` key.

## Changes to licensing of Fedora Linux packages {#_changes_to_licensing_of_fedora_linux_packages}

Fedora package maintainers are responsible for regularly monitoring the
upstream source code of their packages for any changes or additions to
licenses. When a license changes upstream, or a new license is
introduced, the following guidelines apply:

- If the project adds material under a license that hasn't yet been
  reviewed for inclusion in Fedora, then submit the new license for
  review following the process described above.

- If the project adds material under a *not-allowed* license, then the
  package can no longer be included in Fedora Linux, unless you remove
  the material covered by the *not-allowed* license so that Fedora will
  not be distributing anything under that license, including in the
  source code of the package.
  [FESCo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/) has the authority
  to block upgrades of packages to versions with new licenses that are
  not allowed for Fedora.

- If the new license is allowed, update the appropriate spec file
  License tag, unless there is some reason why the license does not have
  to be accounted for in the License tag. Refer to the page on
  [populating spec file License tags](license-field.xml) for details.

Historically, Fedora package maintainers were expected to announce
upstream license changes that they became aware of on the [Fedora devel
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/).
This expectation was probably based on the assumption that any upstream
license change would be a change to all or substantially all the code in
the project, but this is not always the case.

If you are unsure about the status of a new license in a package, please
ask on the [Fedora legal
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/).

# Spec File License: Tags {#_spec_file_license_tags}

This page explains how to populate RPM spec file License: tags and is
aimed mainly at Fedora Linux package maintainers. We assume that you are
experienced in building packages for Fedora Linux, that you have some
familiarity with open source licensing, and that you have carefully
reviewed the documentation on [SPDX license expressions](spdx.xml) and
[Fedora license approval](license-approval.xml). If you are dealing with
a specific package, we assume you have already analyzed the licensing
terms of the source code of the package and determined how those terms
map to SPDX license expressions classified in the Fedora License Data
repository.

## Definitions used in this page {#_definitions_used_in_this_page}

### \"License\" {#_license}

For convenience, except where context indicates otherwise, this page
uses \"license\" narrowly to mean an SPDX license expression that
corresponds to a TOML file in the Fedora License Data repository.

Here are some examples of \"licenses\" in this sense:

- `GPL-2.0-or-later` (status: *allowed*)

- `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception` (status: *allowed*; example of `WITH`
  expression)

- `CC0-1.0` (status: *allowed-content*, and has a `usage` exception)

- `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` (status: *allowed*; Fedora-defined
  umbrella identifier)

- `LicenseRef-sun-rpc` (status: *not-allowed*; Fedora-defined
  identifier)

### \"Fedora-acceptable\" {#_fedora_acceptable}

We say that a license is \"Fedora-acceptable\" in the context of a
specific package if it is:

- *allowed*,

- allowed for a specific category of material (for example,
  *allowed-content*) and, in this package, it only covers that category,
  or

- *not-allowed*, or not allowed for a specific category of material, but
  its use in this package falls within the `usage` exception defined in
  the Fedora License Data TOML file for that license.

## Preliminary note {#_preliminary_note}

The Fedora convention is that License: tags describe a relevant *subset*
of the licenses that apply to the source code of the package. *Any*
license that applies to anything in the source code must be
Fedora-acceptable (assuming you actually need a license for that
material), even if it is ultimately not included in the License: tag.

Therefore, before you can figure out how to populate the License: tag
for a package, you first need to analyze the source code of the package
to determine what licenses apply to that source code. If you encounter
any licenses that do not seem to map to what is already in Fedora
License Data, those licenses must be
[reviewed](license-review-process.xml) for allowability in Fedora based
on Fedora's [license approval](license-approval.xml) criteria.

:::: important
::: title
:::

While typically \"the source code of the package\" refers solely to what
is contained in the SRPM of the package, in some situations it refers
additionally to source code of other Fedora packages. This is discussed
in the (as yet unwritten) section on [Bundling, vendoring, static
linking, and related topics](#bundling).
::::

## Basic rule {#_basic_rule}

The License: tag in the spec file Preamble must be populated with an
SPDX license expression that consists of a Fedora-acceptable license, or
multiple Fedora-acceptable licenses joined by `AND` and/or `OR`
operators. We say that such a license expression is itself
Fedora-acceptable.

Unless your package includes multiple binary subpackages and you opt to
specify [subpackage-specific License: tags](#subpkg), the Preamble
License: tag expression should be an enumeration of all licenses found
in the source code of the package, but excluding any licenses that cover
material in the source code that is not copied into the binary RPM(s),
either verbatim or transformed in some way (for example, by
compilation).

### Simple example {#_simple_example}

::: informalexample
The source code of the package `wayland-utils` is entirely under `MIT`.
The License: tag is:

`License: MIT`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable, since `MIT` is *allowed*.
:::

### More complex example {#_more_complex_example}

::: informalexample
The package `plasmatube` contains executable code compiled from source
code covered mostly by `GPL-3.0-or-later`, though one compiled source
file is under `GPL-2.0-or-later`. It also contains an appdata.xml file
that says it is under `CC0-1.0` (we'll assume this file is
copyrightable) and an SVG file that is under `CC-BY-SA-4.0`. The
License: tag is:

`License: GPL-3.0-or-later AND GPL-2.0-or-later AND CC0-1.0 AND CC-BY-SA-4.0`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable because: (1)
`GPL-3.0-or-later` and `GPL-2.0-or-later` are *allowed*; and (2)
`CC0-1.0` and `CC-BY-SA-4.0` are *allowed-content*, and appdata.xml
files and SVG files are classified as \"content\".
:::

### Source package files not included in binary RPM {#_source_package_files_not_included_in_binary_rpm}

Licenses that cover files in the source code that are not copied into
the binary RPM should be excluded from the License: tag. Consider the
package `xmodmap`:

::: informalexample
The executable file and the man page that make up the `xmodmap` binary
RPM are transformations of files in the `xmodmap` source code that are
covered by `MIT` and `MIT-open-group`. However, the source tarball in
the `xmodmap` SRPM contains a number of Automake, Autoconf, and other
build-related files that are covered in part by a variety of other
licenses (namely, `FSFULLRWD`, `FSFULLR`,
`GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic`,
`GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-macro`,
`GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic-3.0`, `FSFUL`,
`HPND-sell-variant`, `FSFAP`, and `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`).
These licenses are all *allowed*, but since none of those files are
copied into the binary RPM, the corresponding licenses should not be
included in the License: tag. The License: tag is just:

`License: MIT AND MIT-open-group`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable because `MIT` and
`MIT-open-group` are *allowed*.
:::

RPM now supports a `SourceLicense:` tag in addition to the `License:`
tag. You *may* specify source package-only licenses (along with whatever
is in the `License:` tag) in the `SourceLicense` tag. Consider `xmodmap`
again:

::: informalexample
`xmodmap` *could* validly include the following `SourceLicense:` tag:

`SourceLicense: MIT AND MIT-open-group AND FSFULLRWD AND FSFULLR AND GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic AND GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-macro AND GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic-3.0 AND FSFUL AND HPND-sell-variant AND FSFAP AND LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`
:::

We don't recommend or encourage use of `SourceLicense:`.

## No \"effective license\" analysis {#_no_effective_license_analysis}

Except to the extent these guidelines state otherwise, you should not
attempt to simplify or reduce the License: tag license expression (for
example, based on a theory of GPL copyleft interpretation, sublicensing,
or license compatibility, or based on some sort of algebraic
transformation).

**Examples:**

::: informalexample
In the License: tag for the `plasmatube` package, `GPL-2.0-or-later`
should not be omitted even though it can be argued that the
\"effective\" license of the `plasmatube` executable is
`GPL-3.0-or-later`.
:::

::: informalexample
In the `xmodmap` package, you might be able to come up with an argument
for why you can regard one or the other of `MIT` and `MIT-open-group` as
the single license of the files in the binary RPM, though it is unclear
how you would pick one of the two licenses in a non-arbitrary way.
Nevertheless, the License: tag should include both.
:::

## `usage` exceptions {#_usage_exceptions_2}

Some packages in Fedora may include a file covered by a *not-allowed*
license, or a license that is only allowed for a particular category of
material which is different from the category of the material in the
file. For this to be acceptable, the relevant license of the file must
be covered by a \"[`usage`
exception](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/TEMPLATE.toml?ref_type=heads#L99)\"
indicating that the kind of use present in the file is tolerated by
Fedora despite the fact that the license is normally not allowed. Where
a package has a file covered by a normally disallowed license along with
a `usage` exception, the License: tag rules apply as though the license
were allowed.

## Special rules for `OR` expressions {#_special_rules_for_or_expressions}

A license should normally appear only once in the License: tag license
expression. But if the license expression includes an `OR`
sub-expression, that `OR` sub-expression is treated as though it were a
single license for purposes of this rule. As an exception to this rule,
if *all* the license operands of the `OR` sub-expression also appear in
the license expression outside the `OR` sub-expression, then you can
eliminate the `OR` sub-expression.

All the license operands of an `OR` expression should be preserved, but
only to the extent that those license operands are allowed. A license
operand in an `OR` expression that is not allowed should normally be
excluded from the License: tag license expression, which in some cases
will mean that the `OR` expression is replaced with a single license.

**Example:**

::: informalexample
The source code of the package `python-pyqt6-sip` is disjunctively
triple-licensed under the choice of `GPL-2.0-only`, `GPL-3.0-only`, and
the *not-allowed* license `LicenseRef-Riverbank-SIP`. The License: tag
is:

`License: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`

It should not be `License: GPL-2.0-only`, or `License: GPL-3.0-only`,
because no choice should be made among a set of allowed licenses in an
`OR` expression. It should not be
`License: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-Riverbank-SIP`
because a *not-allowed* license that is part of an `OR` expression
should not be included in the License: tag.
:::

## Special rules for Perl packages {#perl-rules}

Perl 5 is released under a dual license that can be represented in SPDX
as `GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`. Many Perl modules say simply
that they are licensed under \"the same terms as Perl itself\". Fedora
treats this as an unambiguous reference to that well-known Perl dual
license.

`Artistic-1.0-Perl` is *not-allowed*. Normally this would mean that
packages that are under the Perl dual license should include only
`GPL-1.0-or-later` in the License: tag rather than the whole `OR`
expression. However, Fedora has accommodated preferences expressed by
Fedora Perl package maintainers and upstream Perl module maintainers by
permitting packages under the Perl dual license to use either

`GPL-1.0-or-later`

or

`GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`

To facilitate this option, Fedora License Data includes a TOML file for
`GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl` with the status *allowed*. There
is a similar TOML file for the less common variant
`GPL-2.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`.

**Example:**

::: informalexample
The Perl module `Archive::Tar`, packaged in Fedora as
`perl-Archive-Tar`, is licensed upstream \"under the same terms as Perl
itself\". The License: tag is properly:

`License: GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`

and this license expression is Fedora-acceptable, even though
`Artistic-1.0-Perl` itself is *not-allowed*.
:::

## Use of `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` {#notcopyrightable}

The licenses encountered in upstream projects which are the subject of
Fedora's license approval inquiry can be thought of primarily as
copyright licenses, though they may (and often must, to meet Fedora
license policy) grant other kinds of licenses as well. A copyright
license is a grant of permission to exercise one or more of the
exclusive rights of the copyright holder. The scope of copyrightable
subject matter (and therefore what can properly be controlled by a
copyright license) is limited, however. A good example is the
[idea-expression
dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%E2%80%93expression_distinction).

Every Fedora package contains many elements that are not copyrightable,
at least when considered in isolation. One common example is character
mappings, such as Unicode character-to-name assignments. In some cases a
nominal license might purport to cover some material that is likely not
copyrightable; this is particularly common with material published by
the Unicode Consortium and unfortunately affects numerous community
projects packaged in Fedora Linux. Typically we ignore such licenses for
purposes of license approval as well as populating the License: tag.

However, in some cases, a binary RPM consists solely of such
noncopyrightable material. Since we want to avoid empty License: tags,
in these cases we use the special Fedora-defined SPDX expression
`LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`. (It follows that
`LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` should never appear in a compound SPDX
license expression.)

**Example:**

::: informalexample
The `dtv-scan-tables` binary RPM consists essentially of a large set of
files containing factual information on TV frequencies and modulation
settings. Such material is almost certainly not subject to copyright in
the United States. By tradition, Fedora assumes treatment of copyright
in other jurisdictions will be similar to treatment in the United
States. The upstream project included copies of GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1;
arguably these licenses applied to the minimally copyrightable README,
but the README is not included in the binary RPM. The appropriate
License: tag is:

`License: LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`
:::

## SPDX license expressions from upstream projects {#_spdx_license_expressions_from_upstream_projects}

### Upstream use of SPDX identifiers {#_upstream_use_of_spdx_identifiers}

Increasingly, upstream community projects are attempting to use SPDX
identifiers (from the SPDX License List) in license metadata (most
notably, license-information fields of upstream packaging files).
(Separately, many projects have begun to use the
`SPDX-License-Identifier:` convention in source file comments in place
of traditional license notices. These are *generally* more useful as
sources of information about package licensing.)

In general, you cannot assume that upstream use of SPDX license
identifiers in metadata is correct or accurate, at least from Fedora's
standpoint, and you should view them critically or skeptically.

### `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-` {#_licenseref_kde_accepted}

Much less commonly, a few upstream projects, most notably KDE, have
adopted the use of SPDX license expressions in a comprehensive manner
comparable to Fedora. Like Fedora, KDE defines certain custom
`LicenseRef-` identifiers using the prefix `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-`.
As noted elsewhere in this documentation, to date there is no official
namespacing approach for `LicenseRef-` identifiers, nor is there any
sort of cross-project convention for what various `LicenseRef-`
identifiers are supposed to signify.

Our current view is that KDE's `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL` identifier
should generally be represented by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only` in
Fedora, and `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL` should generally be
represented by `LGPL-2.1-only OR LGPL-3.0-only`.

===

## Subpackage-specific License: tags {#subpkg}

## Bundling, vendoring, static linking, and related topics {#bundling}

## LaTeX Project Public License {#lppl}

Packages under the LaTeX Project Public License version 1.2 (`LPPL-1.2`)
or any later version are allowed with the understanding that Fedora will
treat such packages as being licensed under the LaTeX Project Public
License version 1.3a or any later version. It is not necessary to
include a copy of version 1.3a or to delete or replace copies of version
1.2, or to alter any notices referring to version 1.2. However, any
License tag that refers to the LPPL in this situation should use
`LPPL-1.3a+`, not `LPPL-1.2` (or `LPPL-1.2+`).

## APSL-1.x Licenses {#_apsl_1_x_licenses}

Packages under the Apple Public Source License version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2
(`APSL-1.x`) are allowed with the understanding that Fedora will treat
such packages as being licensed under the Apple Public Source License
version 2.0 (`APSL-2.0`). It is not necessary to include a copy of
version 1.x or to delete or replace copies of version 1.x, or to alter
any notices referring to version 1.x. However, any License tag that
refers to the APSL-1.x in this situation should use `APSL-2.0`, not
`APSL-1.0` (or `APSL-1.1` or `APSL-1.2`).

# Callaway-to-SPDX migration for existing packages {#_callaway_to_spdx_migration_for_existing_packages}

In July 2022 Fedora adopted the use of SPDX license expressions in place
of the legacy Callaway system for purposes of license approval
classifications and populating spec file License: tags. As of early
2025, the migration from Callaway to SPDX was characterized by one
member of the Fedora Legal team as [99.60%
complete](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JT3PUXBB2IHQVPY5DHRXXHPUHH2XTQOC/).

By this stage, certain Callaway short names have been bulk-converted to
SPDX identifiers where there was adequate confidence that the Callaway
name and the SPDX identifier probably referenced the same underlying
operative license text (\"same\", that is, in an SPDX-specific sense).
Remaining Callaway short names in License: tags, often involving
\"umbrella\" Callaway short names that cover multiple licenses that are
represented with distinct identifiers in SPDX (for example, \"BSD\"),
have generally been crudely converted to valid SPDX format by prefixing
them with `LicenseRef-Callaway-` (for example, Callaway \"BSD\" becomes
`LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD`). It should be noted that these
`LicenseRef-Callaway-` expressions are not present in Fedora License
Data as valid licenses (allowed or otherwise). They are a temporary
solution, for eventual replacement with SPDX license expressions
corresponding to TOML files in the Fedora License Data repository.

Apart from replacement of `LicenseRef-Callaway-` License: tags, much
ongoing work will be needed to improve the accuracy of existing
SPDX-format License: tags, along with continuing review and
classification of newly-encountered licenses.

## Changelog entry {#_changelog_entry}

Package maintainers whose packages still need to migrate License: tags
to SPDX should add the following line to the spec file `%changelog`
section:

    - migrated to SPDX license

or something similar using \"spdx\" in the changelog entry. This will
help the Fedora legal team audit packages.

## Updating Callaway umbrella names {#_updating_callaway_umbrella_names}

The SPDX License List has an established set of [matching
guidelines](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/)
that define what constitutes a match to a license or exception on the
SPDX License List. This ensures that SPDX license identifiers mean the
same thing wherever they are used and takes a somewhat conservative
approach as to what is substantively different. Each identifier for a
license or an exception on the SPDX License List represents a single
template text for that license or exception.

As noted above, some Callaway short names are umbrella categories
referring to a set of substantively different license texts that were
treated as equivalent for Fedora package metadata purposes. It follows
that these Callaway names may correspond to multiple (existing or
future) SPDX identifiers. Review of the actual operative package license
texts will, of course, be necessary to determine what SPDX identifier
(or Fedora-recognized `LicenseRef-` expression) applies. In some cases,
new licenses will need to undergo license review for inclusion in Fedora
License Data.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-MIT` {#_licenseref_callaway_mit}

In the Callaway system, \"MIT\" was used to refer to a large number of
short permissive licenses having some loose textual similarity or
tenuous historical connection to the SPDX `MIT` license (the license
that, today, most people mean when they refer to \"the MIT license\"),
and which did *not* resemble licenses in the historical BSD family.

The SPDX License List contains not only `MIT` but many other licenses
that Callaway \"MIT\" covered, or was intended to cover.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD` {#_licenseref_callaway_bsd}

In the Callaway system, \"BSD\" was used to refer to a large number of
short permissive licenses bearing some textual similarity or historical
connection to licenses in the BSD family.

Many of the licenses in the BSD family are included in the SPDX License
List, including two of the most commonly encountered BSD-family
licenses, `BSD-3-Clause` and `BSD-2-Clause`. Note that `BSD` itself is
not an SPDX license identifier.

### `with-exceptions` {#_with_exceptions}

In the Callaway system, the phrase \"with exceptions\" was sometimes
affixed to GPL-family short names. This was normally meant to indicate
that the relevant GPL-family license was coupled with a permissive
exception or additional permission, though there were some historical
examples of use of \"with exceptions\" to refer to additional
restrictive terms.

SPDX has an exception list covering some of the more
commonly-encountered license exceptions or additional permissions,
including many of the exceptions traditionally used with GPL-family
licenses. However, it is likely that new exceptions will need to be
proposed to SPDX upon review of Fedora packages that historically used
the \"with exceptions\" Callaway sub-label.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2` and `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2+` {#_licenseref_callaway_lgplv2_and_licenseref_callaway_lgplv2}

The Callaway system deliberately did not distinguish between LGPLv2 and
LGPLv2.1, using \"LGPLv2\" to represent both. SPDX has distinct
identifiers for these licenses, so `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2` will
likely correspond to one or more of SPDX `LGPL-2.0-only` and
`LGPL-2.1-only`, and `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2+` will likely
correspond to one or more of `LGPL-2.0-or-later` and
`LGPL-2.1-or-later`.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-Public-domain` {#_licenseref_callaway_public_domain}

In the Callaway system, \"Public domain\" was used for a few distinct
purposes.

#### Bespoke public domain dedications {#_bespoke_public_domain_dedications}

Callaway \"Public domain\" most commonly signified the presence of a
bespoke public domain dedication covering all or part of the package.
(By \"bespoke\", we mean that the instrument releasing material into the
public domain wasn't a relatively standardized and elaborate form having
some of the characteristics of public domain dedications, such as SPDX
`CC0-1.0` or `Unlicense`.) The SPDX License List does not have an
identifier corresponding to this categorical public domain dedication
concept.

Fedora has adopted the umbrella identifier
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` to represent bespoke public domain
dedications. Note that these must be reviewed and approved just like any
other license. Currently we attempt to store approved public domain
dedications (those that qualify for representation with
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`) in the file `public-domain-text.txt`
in the Fedora License Data repository, although we recognize there might
be a more satisfactory approach. At this time it does not seem likely
that SPDX will itself adopt some sort of comparable umbrella identifier.

#### Noncopyrightable material {#_noncopyrightable_material}

In some packages, Callaway \"Public domain\" reflected a conclusion that
substantial parts of the package were not likely not copyrightable. This
is generally not recorded in the package, so the absence of any public
dedication statements coupled with `LicenseRef-Callaway-Public-domain`
may be a clue that historical \"Public domain\" was used for this
noncopyrightable subcategory.

In the post-Callaway SPDX system, we use the Fedora-defined license
expression `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` to cover such cases. However,
in spec file License: tags we only use `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` if
otherwise the License: tag would be empty. That is to say, we only use
`LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` if that label would accurately cover the
entire contents of the binary RPM.

#### Works of U.S. government employees {#_works_of_u_s_government_employees}

Some uses of Callaway \"Public domain\" appear to have been based on the
assumption that code or content in a package was created by employees of
the U.S. federal (i.e., national) government. In the United States,
works of the federal government are not protectable by copyright within
the U.S. (see [17 U.S.C. §
105](https://law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105)). It is fairly clear
that this statutory provision should not have any copyright implications
outside the U.S. Nonetheless, in FOSS legal culture it has been commonly
assumed for convenience that works that are public domain in the U.S.
under 17 U.S.C. § 105 are equivalently unrestricted in other
jurisdictions. There is a common-sense basis for this assumption, but it
implies that the conclusion for the non-U.S. situation rests on there
being an implicit public domain dedication. For at least this reason,
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` is the appropriate license expression
in these cases rather than `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`. In such
cases, nothing would be added to the `public-domain-text.txt` file
unless the package used some sort of public domain dedication text.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-Copyright-only` {#_licenseref_callaway_copyright_only}

In the Callaway system \"Copyright only\" was typically, but
inconsistently, used for very brief bespoke or nonstandard legacy
licenses whose only explicit requirement was preservation of a copyright
notice.

There is no single SPDX identifier corresponding to the typical use of
Callaway \"Copyright only\". Some of the underlying package licenses
associated with this label have been added to the SPDX License List, but
it is expected that many more will be identified in Fedora license
reviews. We currently do not think an umbrella identifier would be
suitable to represent this category of licenses.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-Freely-redistributable-without-restrictions` {#_licenseref_callaway_freely_redistributable_without_restrictions}

In the Callaway system, \"Freely redistributable without restrictions\"
was apparently a relatively old name that was deprecated some years
prior to the adoption of SPDX. While it may not have been used
consistently, it seems to have most commonly been used to represent
brief bespoke or nonstandard permission statements that imposed no
requirements, but which did not take the form of public domain
dedications.

In the post-Callaway system there is a custom identifier,
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`, which is intended to serve as an
umbrella representation for these kinds of permission statements. There
is no equivalent identifier in the SPDX License List that corresponds to
this category. We attempt to track specific permission statements
qualifying for `LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` in the file
`UltraPermissive.txt` in the Fedora License Data repository.

### `LicenseRef-Callaway-Redistributable-no-modification-permitted` {#_licenseref_callaway_redistributable_no_modification_permitted}

In the Callaway system, \"Redistributable, no modification permitted\"
was mainly used to cover non-FOSS firmware licenses. Apparently there
were also rare cases of non-firmware packages using this label in the
License: tag.

Fedora now has a custom SPDX license expression,
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Firmware`, which is intended to cover firmware
licenses that do not meet the requirements for *allowed* status but
which satisfy the relaxed criteria for *allowed-firmware*. License texts
are stored in the file `firmware.txt` in the Fedora License Data
repository.

Non-FOSS firmware licenses likely would not meet the SPDX License
Inclusion Guidelines, so there is no point in submitting them to SPDX.

#### `Public-Domain` or `Ultrapermissive`? {#_public_domain_or_ultrapermissive}

Sometimes, it may be hard to decide if the license should be
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`. E.g., consider this example:

    The author of this program disclaims copyright.

This one should clearly qualify for either
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`, but which one? Thus far, we've been
applying the convention that a permission statement has to contain the
words \"public domain\" to qualify for
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`. We've used
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` to approximately replace Callaway
system \"Freely redistributable without restrictions\" which we have
been taking to refer to unconditional permission grants of some sort
that don't take the form of public domain dedications. This grant is
different, though, in that it doesn't mention the public domain but is a
\"disclaimer\" of copyright rather than an explicit grant of permission.
This is slightly closer in spirit to what we have been using
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`. Although using
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` is no big mistake. When you are in
doubt, submit a [review
issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/new).

### `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-*` {#_licenseref_kde_accepted_2}

KDE project uses
[LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-\*](https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL)
licenses. This was discussed
[here](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/350)
and
[here](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/351).
The consensus is that upstream license `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL`
should be replaced in Fedora by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`. And
upstream license `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL` should be replaced by
`LGPL-2.1-only OR LGPL-3.0-only`.

### `LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-*` {#_licenseref_kfqf_accepted}

KDE project uses
[LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-\*](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/qqc2-desktop-style/-/blob/master/LICENSES/LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-GPL.txt)
licenses. This was discussed
[here](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/374).
The consensus is that upstream license `LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-GPL`
should be replaced in Fedora by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`.

### Small category short names {#_small_category_short_names}

Several Callaway short names are known to correspond to two or more SPDX
identifiers but it is possible that some of those identifiers are not
yet included in Fedora License Data. Some of these Callaway short names
are (in current `LicenseRef-` wrapped format):

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-MIT-with-advertising`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD-with-advertising`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-MPLv1.0`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-MPLv1.1`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-CECILL`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-HSRL`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-Python`

- `LicenseRef-Callaway-AFL`

# License audit tooling for Fedora packages {#_license_audit_tooling_for_fedora_packages}

This page describes some of the tools that have been used to audit
licensing of packages in Fedora Linux.

## Packaging tools {#_packaging_tools}

The following tools are specifically designed for use with Fedora Linux
packages. They use the [Fedora License
Data](https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data) as a source
of data on valid licenses.

### rpmlint {#_rpmlint}

[rpmlint](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint) is the
standard tool used for evaluating Fedora Linux packages for well-known
issues for packagers to fix. In the context of licensing, rpmlint
evaluates the `License:` field in the spec file and ensures the values
conform to [the known set of allowed licenses](allowed-licenses.xml).

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `rpmlint`.

### rpminspect {#_rpminspect}

[rpminspect](https://github.com/rpminspect/rpminspect) is the tool used
to evaluate Fedora Linux packages for policy compliance, differences as
compared to previous builds, and common packaging errors as they are
built in the Fedora Build System. In the context of licensing,
rpminspect evaluates the `License:` field in RPMs and ensures the values
conform to [the known set of allowed licenses](allowed-licenses.xml).

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `rpminspect`. To use it, you need
both `rpminspect` and `rpminspect-data-fedora`.

### license-validate {#_license_validate}

[license-validate](https://pagure.io/copr/license-validate/) validates
license strings. It can validate the Callaway format and SPDX
expressions. Without the `-v` flag, the command does not print anything
and will return a non-zero exit code when the license expression is
invalid.

\$ license-validate -v \--old \'GPLv2 or MIT\' Approved license \$
license-validate -v \'GPL-2.0-only OR MIT\' Approved license \-\--

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `license-validate`.

## License matching to SPDX License List for a specific license text {#_license_matching_to_spdx_license_list_for_a_specific_license_text}

The SPDX project has guidance on various tools and methods to determine
if a given license text matches a license already on the SPDX License
List. See [license
match](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md)

If you identify a license or exception text as a match to an SPDX
identifier, you can then use the SPDX identifier to search in the
**allowed** and **not-allowed** license lists for Fedora.

## License scanning tools for source code {#_license_scanning_tools_for_source_code}

The following tools have been used by Fedora Project contributors to
detect licenses in the source code of current and proposed Fedora Linux
packages. All of these tools are distribution-agnostic.

### Licensecheck {#_licensecheck}

[Licensecheck](https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Licensecheck) is a tool
used to analyze the licensing of source files. This tool is principally
used in the Fedora context for the initial package review for packages
proposed for inclusion in Fedora Linux. Licensecheck is run
automatically as part of [FedoraReview](https://pagure.io/FedoraReview).

By default, licensecheck provides license reports with full license
names, but can be used to produce output using any number of license
identifier schemes.

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `licensecheck`.

### askalano {#_askalano}

[Askalono](https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono), packaged in Fedora
as `askalono-cli`, is a simple license scanning tool written in Rust. It
is most useful for quick analysis of packages coming out of ecosystems
featuring projects known to have (1) highly standardized approaches to
layout of license information (it specifically looks only for files that
are named LICENSE or COPYING or some obvious variant on those), (2)
generally simple license makeup, and (3) cultural preferences for a
highly limited set of licenses (for example, Rust crates that don't
bundle legacy C code, Go modules, or Node.js npm packages).

Askalono has some significant shortcomings. It can't recognize or
understand: (1) license notices/license texts that are comments in
source files, (2) license notices/license texts in README files, (3)
license files that contain multiple license texts (or it will only
recognize the first of them), and (4) nonstandard/archaic/legacy
licenses (which covers most of the licenses being reviewed in issues in
fedora-license-data)

### FOSSology {#_fossology}

[FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/) is a license compliance software
system and tooklit that includes license scanning. It can be run locally
and also can be set up as a hosted service. The FOSSology website
provides information on [using a test
instance](https://www.fossology.org/get-started/) hosted by the OSU Open
Source Lab.

FOSSology is good for scanning an entire package for licenses (or texts
that look like licenses). Files can be viewed easily in the FOSSology
interface. FOSSology has the ability to remember past license inspection
decisions.

Some tips on using FOSSology: \* In Options: **#5 - check \"Ignore SCM
files\"** #7 - check Monk, Nomos, Ojo License Analysis and Package
Analysis \*\* #8 - check first two options re: \"Scanners matches...​\"
\* Go to License Browswer view. Look for license matches that are
suspicious or unexpected, such as things that are not an SPDX identifier
or ambiguous. You can then view the files with those matches and inspect
what was found to determine if there is a license that needs to be
recorded or if it is a false match. [Basic
Workflow](https://www.fossology.org/get-started/basic-workflow/) has
some helpful information.

FOSSology is not packaged in Fedora.

### ScanCode toolkit {#_scancode_toolkit}

[ScanCode toolkit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) is a
command-line Python tool and library for detecting licenses, copyrights,
package metadata and related information in source and binary code.
ScanCode detects licenses by doing a diff against a database of 37,000
license texts and notices.

ScanCode output includes SPDX documentat and a variety of other formats
including JSON, YAML, HTML, CSV, CycloneDX and Debian machine readable
copyright files.

ScanCode reports detected license information using valid SPDX license
expressions (and also ScanCode's own extended list of license keys that
includes licenses that are not included in the SPDX License List). It
applies the SPDX matching guidelines when possible and provides detailed
information on the matched texts and detected licenses.

ScanCode toolkit is also embedded in other tools such as FOSSology,
[tern](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern),
[ORT](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort), and
[FOSSLight](https://fosslight.org/).

ScanCode toolkit packaging in Fedora is in progress. It can be installed
using pip or an app tarball.

The recommended way of running ScanCode is:
`scancode --license --html output.html --license-references -n$(nproc --all)`

### ScanCode.io {#_scancode_io}

[ScanCode.io](https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io) is a web application
to run ScanCode toolkit pipelines on multiple projects. A pipeline is a
script to organize the code analysis of large codebases, binaries,
containers (or single packages) with optional code matching against an
index of pre-existing FOSS code. ScanCode.io is useful for scanning an
entire package for licenses notices, license texts and \"license
clues\". Files can be viewed easily in the ScanCode.io interface. See
[Documentation](http://scancode.io/) to get started.

ScanCode.io is not yet packaged in Fedora. It can be installed using
containers and podman.

### Trivy {#_trivy}

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is more robust than
Askalono or Licensecheck but less verbose than ScanCode. Upstream
provides static RPM packages.

You can run the check with command:
`trivy fs --scanners license --license-full .`

scanning](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/scanner/license/).
= How to identify package licenses

The information about what licenses apply to a project typically can be
found in a few places:

- **License files**: The source code may contain a specific file
  containing just the license text (most often named LICENSE or COPYING,
  but many other conventions and variant practices exist). These license
  files are usually, but not always, in the root directory of the source
  tree. There may be more than one such file, in which case, hopefully,
  there is information elsewhere in the source tree that explains the
  applicability of the different licenses. License files may also be
  present in non-root directories in the source tree, such as in cases
  where the files in one part of the source tree are licensed under a
  license that is different from the rest of the source tree.

- **Source files**: License notices referencing a particular license, or
  even the full text of relatively short licenses, are often found in
  source files. License notices may include: standard license notices
  suggested by the license itself (e.g., GPL, Apache-2.0); short concise
  statements (e.g., \"This file is under the MIT license\" or
  \"SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\"); statements that simply refer to the
  license file that require finding that file (e.g., \"See COPYING\");
  or unclear or ambiguous statements that require further investigation
  (e.g., \"This file is licensed the same as Ruby\").

- Information about applicable license terms may be present in
  descriptive form, such as a statement in a README, the project
  webpage, metadata intended for a downstream packaging system or
  package repository, or in a file dedicated to explaining the license
  terms.

Unfortunately, it is rather common for this sort of information to be
inconsistent with or contradict other license information elsewhere.
While it's difficult to give general guidance on this situation, you
generally cannot ignore license information that is \"closer\" to the
code (for example, a license notice in a source file) even if it might
seem to be contradicted by license information \"further\" from the code
(for example, a license statement in a top-level README or on a project
website).

## Phantom licenses {#_phantom_licenses}

As a project evolves, it is not uncommon for license information in the
project repository to become outdated. This is less likely to be the
case for license files and source file license notices. But we have been
finding this to be a problem for relatively old and complex projects
that have recorded some information about third-party licensing in
so-called \"notice files\" or other files containing informal license
information. The file will say that a particular license applies to
something in the repository, but close examination may reveal that the
material the license applied to has been deleted from the repository. We
have been using the term \"phantom license\" to refer to this
phenomenon.

Because such phantom licenses don't actually apply to anything being
packaged, you do not need to ensure that they are allowed for Fedora and
you do not need to include them in the SPDX expression in the license
tag. Of course, you should only conclude that something is a phantom
license if it is clear that what it was formerly applicable to is no
longer present in the repository. If you find a phantom license, we
encourage you to report it to the upstream project.

# License of Fedora Linux {#_license_of_fedora_linux}

Fedora Linux is a
[compilation](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=17-USC-2076770877-364936160&term_occur=999&term_src=title:17:chapter:1:section:101)
of software packages, each under its own licensing terms. For some
complicated historical reasons Fedora Linux has always had an explicit
compilation license. Since Fedora 22 the compilation license has simply
been the MIT license. This compilation license does not supersede the
licenses of code and content contained in Fedora Linux, which conform to
the guidelines described at [License Approval](license-approval.xml).

With respect to the notice inclusion provision of the MIT license,
solely with respect to the Fedora Linux compilation license grant,
Fedora does not regard non-Fedora-branded downstream derivative
distributions as being \"copies or substantial portions of the
Software.\"

# Fedora Project Contributor Agreement {#_fedora_project_contributor_agreement}

The only purpose of the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA) is
to ensure that Fedora has default permission to use your contributions
under a Fedora-allowed license (either MIT for software or CC BY-SA for
content). You may contribute under any other allowed Fedora license; the
FPCA simply sets a default if no license is specified.

Nothing in the FPCA takes anything away from you. You retain ownership
of your contributions.

If you have any questions about the FPCA, please email
<legal@fedoraproject.org>.

    The Fedora Project Contributor Agreement
    [Version 2021-05-04]

    Goal
    ---------

    We require that contributors to Fedora (as defined below) agree to
    this Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA) to ensure that
    contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms.

    Non-Goals
    ---------

    The FPCA is *not* a copyright assignment agreement.

    The FPCA does *not* somehow supersede the existing licensing terms
    that apply to Fedora contributions.  There are two important subpoints
    here.  First, the FPCA does not apply to upstream code (or other
    material) that you didn't write; indeed, it would be preposterous for
    it to attempt to do so.  Note the narrow way in which we have defined
    capital-c "Contribution".  Second, the main provision of the FPCA
    specifies that a default license will apply to code that you wrote,
    but only to the extent that you have not bothered to put an explicit
    license on it. Therefore, the FPCA is *not* some sort of special
    permissive license granted to any party, despite the explicit choice
    of a more restrictive license by you or by upstream developers.

    Terms
    ---------

    0.  Definitions.

    "Acceptable License For Fedora" means a license selected from the
    appropriate categorical sublist of the full list of acceptable
    licenses for Fedora, currently located at
    https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/allowed-licenses/,
    as that list may be revised from time to time by the Fedora Council.
    "Acceptable Licenses For Fedora" means that full list.

    "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
    International license, as published at
    <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode>.

    "Code" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional material
    whose principal purpose is to control or facilitate the building of
    packages, such as an RPM spec file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other
    kinds of copyrightable material that the Fedora Council has
    classified as "code" rather than "content".

    "Content" means any copyrightable material that is not Code, such as,
    without limitation, (i) non-functional data sets, (ii) documentation,
    (iii) wiki edits, (iv) music files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help
    files, and (vii) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Fedora
    Council has classified as "content" rather than "code".

    "Contribution" means a Work that You created, excluding any portion
    that was created by someone else.  (For example, if You Submit a
    package to Fedora, the spec file You write may be a Contribution, but
    all the upstream code in the associated SRPM that You did not write is
    not a Contribution for purposes of this FPCA.)  A Contribution
    consists either of Code or of Content.

    "Current Default License", with respect to a Contribution, means (i)
    if the Contribution is Code, the MIT License, and (ii) if the
    Contribution is Content, CC-BY-SA.

    "Fedora" means the community project led by the Fedora Council
    <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/>.

    "Fedora Community" means (i) all Fedora participants, and (ii) all
    persons receiving Contributions directly or indirectly from or through
    Fedora.

    "Licensed" means covered by explicit licensing terms that are
    conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients.

    "MIT License" means the license identified as "Modern Style with
    sublicense" at
    <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT#Modern_Style_with_sublicense>.

    "Submit" means to use some mode of digital communication (for example,
    without limitation, mailing lists, bug tracking systems, and source
    code version control systems administered by Fedora) to voluntarily
    provide a Contribution to Fedora.

    "Unlicensed" means not Licensed.

    "Work" means a copyrightable work of authorship. A Work may be a
    portion of a larger Work, and a Work may be a modification of or
    addition to another Work.

    "You" means the individual accepting this instance of the FPCA.

    1. Copyright Permission Required for All Contributions.

    If You are not the copyright holder of a given Contribution that You
    wish to Submit to Fedora (for example, if Your employer or university
    holds copyright in it), it is Your responsibility to first obtain
    authorization from the copyright holder to Submit the Contribution
    under the terms of this FPCA on behalf of, or otherwise with the
    permission of, that copyright holder.  One form of such authorization
    is for the copyright holder to place, or permit You to place, an
    Acceptable License For Fedora on the Contribution.

    2.  Licensed Contributions.

    If Your Contribution is Licensed, Your Contribution will be governed
    by the terms under which it has been licensed.

    3.  Default Licensing of Unlicensed Contributions.

    If You Submit an Unlicensed Contribution to Fedora, the license to the
    Fedora Community for that Contribution shall be the Current Default
    License.

    The Fedora Council may, by public announcement, subsequently
    designate an additional or alternative default license for a given
    category of Contribution (a "Later Default License"). A Later Default
    License shall be chosen from the appropriate categorical sublist of
    Acceptable Licenses For Fedora.

    Once a Later Default License has been designated, Your Unlicensed
    Contribution shall also be licensed to the Fedora Community under that
    Later Default License.  Such designation shall not affect the
    continuing applicability of the Current Default License to Your
    Contribution.

    You consent to having Fedora provide reasonable notice of Your
    licensing of Your Contribution under the Current Default License (and,
    if applicable, a Later Default License) in a manner determined by
    Fedora.

    4.  Public Domain United States Government Works.

    Sections 1 through 3 of this FPCA do not apply to any Contribution to
    the extent that it is a work of the United States Government for which
    copyright is unavailable under 17 U.S.C. 105.

    5.  Acceptance.

    You must signify Your assent to the terms of this FPCA through
    specific electronic means established by Fedora (such as by
    click-through acceptance means).

    You may also, at Your option, and without eliminating the requirement
    set forth in the preceding paragraph, send a copy of this FPCA,
    bearing Your written signature indicating Your acceptance of its
    terms, by email to legal@fedoraproject.org, by fax to +1 919 754 3704,
    or by postal mail to:

## Frequently Asked questions {#_frequently_asked_questions}

Q: What is the purpose of the FPCA?\
A: The FPCA exists for one main reason: to ensure that contributions to
Fedora have acceptable licensing terms.

Q: If I agree to the FPCA, am I assigning copyright to Fedora or Red
Hat?\
A: No. The FPCA is not a copyright assignment agreement.

Q: Does this mean that Fedora will always relicense my contributions
from \$MY_LICENSE to MIT?\
A: No. If you put a Fedora-allowed license on your contribution, we will
use it under the terms of that license. If you put it under a
not-allowed license, we won't use it at all. Only unlicensed
contributions where the copyright holder is the Fedora contributor
qualify for the \"default licensing\" clause.

Q: If I make a contribution to a Fedora project that is clearly licensed
under GPLv2-or-later, and my changes don't have an explicit GPL or other
license notice on them, does the FPCA mean I am making my changes under
the MIT license?\
A: No. In this case, Fedora views your contribution as \"Licensed\",
i.e., \"covered by explicit licensing terms that are conspicuous and
readily discernible to recipients\". Those licensing terms are
GPLv2-or-later. So your changes are licensed under GPLv2-or-later and
the FPCA default license does not apply.

Q: Do I need to physically sign the FPCA?\
A: No. We require that all contributors agree to it digitally, through
the [Fedora Accounts System](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/). If
you wish to additionally sign a physical copy and send it to us, the
FPCA describes how to do this, but it is **not** required.

Q: Are all Fedora users/distributors required to agree to the FPCA?\
A: No. Only Fedora contributors will be required to agree to the FPCA.
Although, if you want to agree to it, you can. :)

Q: The FPCA defines \"default licenses\" of MIT for code, and Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 for content, why not
\$OTHER_LICENSE?\
A: The MIT license was chosen for code because of its widespread use
(including in Fedora-related projects and Fedora Linux packages) and
compatibility with other free licenses. CC BY-SA was chosen (originally
version 3.0, later version 4.0) because it came to be significantly
preferred by Fedora contributors developing documentation and content
for Fedora.

Q: If I'm granting the MIT license or CC BY-SA by default, how is Fedora
dealing with the notice or attribution requirements of those licenses?\
A: The FPCA says: \"You consent to having Fedora provide reasonable
notice of Your licensing of Your Contribution under the Current Default
License (and, if applicable, a Later Default License) in a manner
determined by Fedora.\" Since adoption of the FPCA, Fedora has been
treating as \"reasonable notice\" public notice of the FPCA as an
inbound licensing policy coupled with the public record of particular
Fedora contributions; any other approach would be impractical. Fedora
views this \"reasonable notice of Your licensing\" as covering license
notice provisions of the MIT license and CC BY-SA. As for attribution
under CC BY-SA, Fedora's view is that any contributor of \"Unlicensed
Content\" does not desire attribution because they did not specify an
attribution preference when making the contribution. You can always use
an explicit license on your contributions if you prefer, including any
preferred copyright notice or author attribution.

Q: Are RPM spec files covered by the FPCA?\
A: Yes, assuming a given spec file is subject to copyright. Spec files
are explicitly named as an example of a contribution, to clear up a past
confusion.

Q: Can we translate the FPCA into other languages?\
A: Yes, although only the English text is binding for the purposes of
agreement. Any translations which are created are not \"legal
translations\", and exist only to assist non-English speaking
contributors. All Fedora contributors must agree to the English text.

Q: I have a question/suggestion/flame about the FPCA that is not covered
here, where should I send it to?\
A: If you want to discuss it in public, please subscribe to the
[fedora-legal-list](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/legal)
and post your thoughts there. If you do not wish to discuss it in
public, feel free to send it via email to <legal@fedoraproject.org>.

Q: Can I use the FPCA as a license for my code/content?\
A: Well, technically, you can do whatever you want, but you really
shouldn't. It wouldn't work very well.

Q: My FOSS friendly project would like to take the FPCA, change Fedora
to the name of our project, and use the FPCA, can we do this?\
A: Sure. You can consider the FPCA to be under the terms of the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0, with the notable exception of the
Fedora trademarks, which may only be used under the Fedora Trademark
Guidelines. If modified, attribution should occur in the actual document
itself. For attribution in other scenarios, please contact
<legal@fedoraproject.org>. One piece of advice: If you decide to make
changes beyond simply changing the name of the FPCA or replacing the
Fedora trademarks, you really should consult with a lawyer, to make sure
that the document is still legally valid and says what you mean.
Remember, legalese is not English.

Q: Who wrote this amazing masterpiece of legal text?\
A: Many people were involved in helping to craft this text. The primary
author was Richard Fontana, with feedback from Tom Callaway, Pamela
Chestek, Paul Frields, and Robert Tiller. Feel free to give them gifts
(for example, drinks or tasty snacks) as thank yous, although, this is
not a requirement (legal or otherwise). ;)

## Historical FAQs {#_historical_faqs}

Some of the following FAQs refer to the Fedora Individual Contributor
License Agreement (ICLA), which preceded adoption of the FPCA in 2011
and which was no longer used after adoption of the FPCA.

Q: Why change the Fedora ICLA to the FCPA?\
A: The previous agreement, the Fedora ICLA, wasn't really well
structured for the needs of Fedora. It was composed of a lot of legal
boilerplate, and was written before Fedora had really taken shape. In
fact, the only reason that we were able to leverage it for as long as we
did is because of some creative interpretation on the part of Fedora
Legal. Also, there were many people who could not agree to the Fedora
ICLA for a variety of reasons, and we hoped that the FPCA would resolve
most (if not all) of those concerns.

Q: Why did you change the name from ICLA to FPCA?\
A: The new text is not really a \"Contributor License Agreement\" in the
traditional sense. The FPCA exists for one main reason: to ensure that
contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms. We chose a name
that did not use \"CLA\" to avoid confusion and to mark it as a
distinctly specific license.

Q: When was the Fedora ICLA retired?\
A: There was be a window of time (between Tuesday May 17, 2011 and
Friday June 17, 2011) when we attempted to get all current Fedora
contributors who had agreed to the Fedora ICLA to agree to the FPCA.
Once that window closed, any contributors in the system who did not
agree to the FPCA were removed from \"cla_done\" (note: including
membership in other, dependent FAS groups).

Q: What changed between the 2011-03-29 Version and the 2015-02-03
Version?\
A. The 2011-03-29 version referenced the Fedora Board, which has been
obsoleted/replaced by the Fedora Council. The FPCA text was updated to
reflect that change. No other changes were made.

Q: What changed between the 2015-02-03 Version and the 2021-05-04
Version?\
A: The Fedora Council updated the default content license to the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0)
license.

Q: What changed between the 2021-05-04 Version and the 2021-10-25 edit?\
A: The Fedora Council removed accidentally-overlooked clauses in the
text which were made obsolete by the update to CC-BY-SA 4.0. The FAQ was
also updated to refer to the 4.0 version of the license. = License
Compatibility

License compatibility is a FOSS legal folk doctrine that concerns the
combinability of code covered by different licenses. It has no specific
basis in statutory or judge-made law. Much of the discourse around
license compatibility is incoherent, contradictory and poorly reasoned,
and rests on dubious interpretive foundations.

Even when relatively clearly formulated, pronouncements on license
compatibility tend to have a restrictive bias. Fedora has long taken a
skeptical view of such pronouncements, which are typically inconsistent
with deeply established packaging traditions and development practices
of community Linux distributions and other FOSS community projects.

Despite this general standpoint of skepticism, Fedora takes assertions
of license incompatibility seriously. Indeed, in (extremely) rare cases,
packages have been excluded from Fedora Linux because of a license
incompatibility issue.

If you believe there is a license incompatibility problem of some sort
raised by a Fedora Linux package, we encourage you to [file a bug
report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com). We will investigate the issue in
due course.

# Miscellaneous legal packaging topics {#_miscellaneous_legal_packaging_topics}

This page provides information on various legal or licensing aspects of
Fedora packaging, such as certain non-license criteria for approval of
certain kinds of packages or files in Fedora Linux, and certain specific
interpretations of licensing issues made by Fedora.

## License of Fedora spec files {#_license_of_fedora_spec_files}

All original Fedora contributions are governed by the [Fedora Project
Contributor Agreement (FPCA)](fpca.xml). For all practical purposes, all
Fedora spec files are contributed by FPCA signers. This means that
unless a spec file contains an explicit license or license notice
stating otherwise, or there is some other evidence to the contrary, the
spec file is available under the terms of the MIT license, to the extent
it is copyrightable. Where there is no explicit MIT license notice in a
spec file, it is understood that there is no requirement to add one
(that is to say, the \"default\" MIT license is equivalent to [MIT No
Attribution](https://opensource.org/license/mit-0/)).

## Emulators {#_emulators}

Some emulators (applications which emulate another platform) are not
permitted for inclusion in Fedora Linux. These rules will help you
determine if an emulator is acceptable for Fedora.

- Emulators which depend on firmware or ROM files to function may not be
  included in Fedora Linux, unless the copyright holder(s) for the
  firmware/ROM files give clear permission for the firmware/ROM files to
  be distributed (either under a Fedora *allowed* license or a Fedora
  *allowed-firmware* license). Note: This only covers the situation
  where an emulator will not run at all without firmware/ROM files. For
  example, emulators that compile and run, but ship with no game ROMs
  are not covered by this rule.

- Emulators must not ship with any ROM files (e.g. games) unless those
  ROM files are available under a Fedora *allowed* license and have been
  built from source code in the Fedora buildsystem.

- Emulators must not point to any third-party sites which provide
  firmware or ROM files that are distributed without the clear and
  explicit permission of their copyright holders.

- All other Fedora licensing and packaging rules apply to emulators.

## Licensing of RSA implementations of MD5 {#_licensing_of_rsa_implementations_of_md5}

It is common to encounter old RSA reference C implementations of the MD5
message-digest algorithm under a free software license containing an
advertising requirement, similar to the better-known advertising clause
in old versions of the BSD license. Such advertising clauses have
generally been understood to be GPL-incompatible. The RSA license is
included in the SPDX License List under the short identifier
[`RSA-MD`](https://spdx.org/licenses/RSA-MD.html). The MD5 reference
implementation also appears in [RFC
1321](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1321), which states that
distribution of the RFC document is \"unlimited.\"

In 2000 RSA provided a
[clarification](https://www.ietf.org/ietf-ftp/ietf/IPR/RSA-MD-all) of
\"the status of intellectual property rights asserted by \[RSA\] in the
MD2, MD4 and MD5 message-digest algorithms\", saying \"Implementations
of these message-digest algorithms, including implementations derived
from the reference C code in RFC-1319, RFC-1320, and RFC-1321, may be
made, used, and sold without license from RSA for any purpose.\"

Fedora traditionally interpreted this RSA statement as, in effect,
superseding the `RSA-MD` license except to the extent that the license
required \"copyright attribution\".

Under present-day policies for populating the spec file License: field,
if you encounter RSA code under this license, you do not need to, and
probably should not, do any of the following:

- Record `RSA-MD` (or any other license identifier) in the License:
  field

- Install a copy of the RSA license in /usr/share/licenses

- Copy or reference the external 2000 RSA statement

However, unless you have guidance from Fedora Legal suggesting
otherwise, you should retain the RSA copyright and license notice as
found in the upstream source code.

# Privacy Statement for the Fedora Project {#_privacy_statement_for_the_fedora_project}

## Scope of This Notice {#_scope_of_this_notice}

This Privacy Statement is intended to describe the Fedora Project's
privacy practices and provide information about the choices you have
regarding the ways in which information collected by the Fedora Project
is used and disclosed. For convenience, the Fedora Project is referred
to in this document as \"Fedora\".

## Our Commitment to Privacy {#_our_commitment_to_privacy}

At Fedora, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your
privacy, we have provided this Statement explaining our information
practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal
information is collected, used and disclosed. To make this Statement
easy to find, we have made it available on our homepage and at every
location where personally-identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect {#_the_information_we_collect}

This Privacy Statement applies to all information collected by or
submitted to Fedora, including personal data. \"Personal data\" is data
that can be used to identify an individual.

Fedora collects personal data when:

- you create a user account;

- you participate in surveys and evaluations;

- you participate in promotions, contests or giveaways;

- you submit questions or comments to us.

Fedora may also collect personal data from individuals (with their
consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions. The types of
personal data collected may include (but are not limited to):

- your first and last name;

- your title and your company's name;

- your home, billing, or other physical address (including street name,
  name of a city or town, state/province);

- your country code;

- your e-mail address;

- your telephone number;

- any other identifier that permits Fedora to make physical or online
  contact with you;

- any information that Fedora collects online from you and maintains in
  association with your account, such as:

  - your Fedora Account System password,

  - your GPG key ID,

  - your SSH public key,

  - your IRC nickname,

  - your language preference,

  - your timezone,

  - your geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude),

  - your affiliation(s).

## Publicly Available Personal Data {#_publicly_available_personal_data}

In keeping with the open nature and spirit of Fedora, some personal data
attached to Fedora accounts is made public by default. Specifically:

- your first and last name;

- your country code;

- your email address;

- your language preference;

- your SSH public key;

- your timezone;

- your GPG key ID (if defined);

- your IRC nickname (if defined);

- your geographic coordinates (if defined);

- your affiliations (if defined).

If you wish for this information to be kept private, you can opt-out of
displaying this information publicly in your [Fedora Account
Preferences](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/). If you choose to
opt-out, Fedora will still have access to this information, but it will
not be displayed to others, and will be considered Private. The only
exception to this is for your email address, which may still be visible
in some Fedora services such as Bugzilla.

## Using (Processing) Your Personal Data {#_using_processing_your_personal_data}

Fedora uses the personal data you provide to:

- create and maintain your accounts;

- identify and authenticate you;

- attribute data and content you produce directly and indirectly in our
  public-facing services;

- answer your questions;

- send you information;

- for research activities, including the production of statistical
  reports (such aggregated information is not used to contact the
  subjects of the report);

- send you surveys.

We also use this personal data to provide you with information related
to your account and the products or services you acquire from us, to
better understand your needs and interests, to improve our service, to
personalize communications, and to comply with or fulfill any
contractual obligations to you. It is in Fedora's legitimate business
interests to provide you with the information, communications, and
services you request; to create a public record of the data and content
produced by Fedora's services; and to maintain the integrity of that
data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes.

## Sharing Your Personal Data {#_sharing_your_personal_data}

Unless you consent, Fedora will never process or share the personal data
you provide to us except as described below.

Fedora may share your personal data with third parties under any of the
following circumstances:

- Your publicly available personal data in the Fedora account system, as
  described above, is accessible by anyone unless you, as the account
  holder, opt out as already described in this Privacy Statement.

- As required to provide service, and for e-mail housing (as a
  consequence of uses already described in this Privacy Statement). It
  is in Fedora's legitimate business interest to provide all users an
  accurate record of data and content provided by Fedora's services, and
  to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical,
  scientific, and research purposes. This data and content may include
  but is not limited to email, code changes, comments, and artifacts.

- As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant,
  audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud).

- For research activities, including the production of statistical
  reports (such aggregated information is used to describe our services
  and is not used to contact the subjects of the report).

## Receiving E-Mail {#_receiving_e_mail}

Fedora may send you e-mail about your account, to inform you of
important upcoming Fedora events (e.g. elections), or in response to
your questions. For your protection, Fedora may contact you in the event
that we find an issue that requires your immediate attention. Fedora
processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply with
its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have
requested, and to ensure the security of your account.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information {#_cookies_and_other_browser_information}

Fedora's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP
addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our
website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our
services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your
location, in order to provide you data and content from our services as
quickly as possible. It is in Fedora's legitimate business interest to
maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized
services, Fedora uses cookies to store and sometimes track information
about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your
browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All
sections of fedoraproject.org where you are prompted to log in or that
are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to:

- Remind us of who you are and to access your account information
  (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more
  personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or \"sign
  in\" and is modified when you \"sign out\" of our services.

- Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing Fedora is given a
  unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and
  usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.

- Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions,
  sweepstakes, and contests. When a Fedora hosted promotion uses
  cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the person's
  progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries,
  submissions, and status in prize drawings.

- Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Fedora's network of
  websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the
  aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits
  are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new
  experience on fedoraproject.org a better one. We may use this
  information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions
  you and other users will see on our sites.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies,
you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies
or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must
understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain
services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and
functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes
instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the
browser level (usually located in the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit"
facility).

## Our Commitment to Data Security {#_our_commitment_to_data_security}

Fedora trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and
makes our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data
when you send your personal information on our website. In addition,
Fedora and its partners enter into confidentiality agreements which
require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or
disclosure of your personal data.

## Public Forums Reminder {#_public_forums_reminder}

Fedora often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards,
and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.
Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although
we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Fedora reserves
the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these
areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It
is in Fedora's legitimate business interests to provide all users an
accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it
maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content
for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an
environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to
the development and propagation of open source software.

## Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy {#_our_commitment_to_childrens_online_privacy}

Out of special concern for children's privacy, Fedora does not knowingly
accept online personal information from children under the age of 13.
Fedora does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become
registered members of our sites. Fedora does not knowingly collect or
solicit personal information about children under 13.

In the event that Fedora ever decides to expand its intended site
audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web
pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an
explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition,
Fedora will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental
approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request
removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to
any other information as required by law.

## About Links to Other Sites {#_about_links_to_other_sites}

This site contains links to other sites. Fedora does not control the
information collection of sites that can be reached through links from
fedoraproject.org. If you have questions about the data collection
procedures of linked sites, please contact those sites directly.

## Your Rights and Choices in the EEA {#_your_rights_and_choices_in_the_eea}

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR")
applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you
access the website from a country in the European Economic Area ("EEA"),
you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against
Fedora:

- The right to access your personal data;

- The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;

- The right to erase your personal data;

- The right to restrict our use of your personal data;

- The right to object to our use of your personal data;

- The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format
  and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data
  portability); and

- The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
  authority.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so via our
[Personal Data Request Form](https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr). Please
understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all
cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent
you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw
consent that you have previously provided to Fedora, you may do so via
our [Personal Data Request Form](https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr). However,
the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing
based on consent before its withdrawal.

## How to Access, Modify or Update Your Information {#_how_to_access_modify_or_update_your_information}

Fedora gives you the ability to access, modify or update your personal
data at any time. You may [log in](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/)
and make changes to your login information (change your password), your
contact information, your general preferences and your personalization
settings. If necessary, you may also contact us and describe the changes
you want made to the personal data you have previously provided using
the [Personal Data Request Form](https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr).

If you wish to remove your personal data from Fedora, you may contact us
using the Personal Data Requests Form and request that we remove this
information from the Fedora Account System. Other locations where you
may have used your personal data as an identifier (e.g. Bugzilla
comments, list postings in the archives, wiki change history, and spec
changelogs) will not be altered.

## How to Contact Us {#_how_to_contact_us}

If you have any questions about any of these practices or Fedora's use
of your personal information, please feel free to contact us [by
email](mailto:legal@fedoraproject.org), or by mail at:

this Statement.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement {#_changes_to_this_privacy_statement}

Fedora reserves the right to change this policy from time to time. If we
do make changes, the revised Privacy Statement will be posted on this
site. A notice will be posted on our homepage for 30 days whenever this
privacy statement is changed in a material way.

This Privacy Statement was last amended on May 25, 2018.

# Fedora trademark guidelines {#_fedora_trademark_guidelines}

## Subject of the Guidelines {#_subject_of_the_guidelines}

The Fedora Trademark Guidelines ("Guidelines") cover all registered and
unregistered trademarks related to the Fedora Project, including
Fedora®, the Fedora logo, Fedora Remix, and the Fedora Remix logo,
Fedora Ready and the Fedora Ready logo, either separately or in
combination, (the \"Fedora Trademarks\"). Red Hat retains and reserves
all rights to the Fedora Trademarks and their use, including the right
to modify these guidelines.

The overarching principle for these Guidelines is that you may not use
the Fedora Trademarks or any confusingly similar mark in a manner that
might cause confusion or mislead anyone, either directly or by omission.
If your use seems to be permitted, but there is nevertheless the
possibility that someone will mistake what your relationship is to the
Fedora Project or Red Hat, you cannot use the Fedora Trademark in that
way. In these Guidelines, we are not trying to limit the lawful use of
the Fedora Trademarks, including their "fair use," but rather describe
for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be.

Nothing in these Guidelines is meant to limit your rights under the
terms of a free and open source software license. Trademarks and
copyright are different rights, so regardless of what rights or
permissions you may or may not have to use the Fedora Trademarks, you
always have all your rights under any applicable free and open source
software licenses.

## Use by Red Hat {#_use_by_red_hat}

Red Hat protects the Fedora Trademarks on behalf of the entire Fedora
community. The law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and
prevent the use of confusingly similar names by third parties. As the
trademark owner, Red Hat uses the Fedora Trademarks under the same
guidelines as the rest of the community.

## The Fedora Council {#_the_fedora_council}

Red Hat enlists the assistance of the Fedora Council ( \"Council\") to
oversee the Guidelines to ensure compliance by the community. The
Council may grant permission for uses as explained below. The Council
serves as the first line of mediation when questions of use arise.

## Usage That Requires Permission {#_usage_that_requires_permission}

Without separate permission from the Council you cannot:

- Use the Fedora Trademarks in a way that expresses or implies
  sponsorship or endorsement by, or affiliation or a relationship with
  the Fedora Project or Red Hat when one does not exist.

- Use Fedora Trademarks on any merchandise, swag, or non-software goods.

- Use terminology that states or implies that the Fedora Project or Red
  Hat assumes any responsibility for the performance of your products or
  services.

- Use or register, in whole or in part, the Fedora Trademarks, or any
  phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or
  abbreviation as part of your own trademark, service mark, company
  name, trade name, product name, service name, or domain name.

- Use the Fedora Trademarks in a disparaging or inappropriate manner or
  in any manner that violates any federal, state, or international law
  or regulation.

- Imitate or copy the Fedora Project's distinctive trade dress.

## Usage That Does Not Require Permission {#_usage_that_does_not_require_permission}

Below is some guidance on uses we are commonly asked about. In all
cases, use is permitted only provided that:

- the use is only in connection with promoting the Fedora Project or
  Fedora code, documentation, content, fonts, and firmware ("Fedora
  Materials");

- the use is not disparaging to Red Hat, the Fedora Project or their
  products;

- the use is appropriate for the mark used, for example, \"Fedora
  Remix\" is used only for remix products and no other Fedora Trademarks
  are used for remix products;

- the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by the Fedora
  Project or Red Hat; proper trademark symbols are used in connection
  with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement
  must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use; and

- the [Fedora brand
  standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/) are
  strictly observed.

### Community sites and accounts {#_community_sites_and_accounts}

Fedora defines community sites and accounts as sites or accounts related
to the Fedora Project, but not officially maintained by Marketing team
members or Social Media administrators. They may be region or country
specific and are usually run by an individual contributor or group of
contributors. These sites are non-commercial in nature (they are not
selling a product).

Examples of these pages include (but are not limited to):

- placing the Fedora Trademarks on a personal website or blog to support
  the Fedora Project;

- making or running a group or account on a social networking web
  service to support the Fedora Project; or

- linking to the Fedora Project from a website to provide information or
  show support for the Fedora Project.

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on community sites and
accounts to show your support for the Fedora Project, provided that:

- use of any Fedora logo hyperlinks to the Fedora Project website,
  <https://fedoraproject.org/>, or if that is not possible, the site
  includes a prominent link to the Fedora Project website at
  <https://fedoraproject.org/>.

- the site indicates clearly that it is not affiliated with or endorsed
  by the Fedora Project; in addition:

  - the site must include the text \"This site is not affiliated with or
    endorsed by the Fedora Project\" prominently on any page that
    includes the Fedora Trademarks;

  - if the Fedora Trademarks appear in a page header or any area that is
    designed to be presented on more than one page, the notice must also
    be designed to be presented on all of those pages as well. (i.e., if
    the Fedora Trademarks appear in a site-wide header, the
    informational text must appear in that header or an identically
    site-wide footer.); and

  - the site does not use the Fedora Project's trade dress (i.e. the
    look and feel of the Fedora Project).

While these online community sites and accounts are not officially
endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, because they are part of the
Fedora Community (and use the Fedora trademarks to identify themselves),
their site owners, moderators, administrators, and users are required to
comply with the [Fedora Code of
Conduct](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/).
Community sites and accounts which are unable to meet this standard of
conduct will be required to cease use of the Fedora Trademarks.

### Business websites

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on business websites,
provided that:

- the website has non-Fedora primary branding;

- use of any Fedora logo hyperlinks to the Fedora Project website,
  <https://fedoraproject.org/>, or if that is not possible, the site
  includes a prominent link to the Fedora Project website at
  <https://fedoraproject.org/>;

- no Fedora Trademarks are used as part of the domain name;

- the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the
  Fedora Project; and

- the site does not use the Fedora Project's trade dress.

Provided these guidelines are observed, it is permissible to use the
Fedora Trademarks to sell Fedora Materials, and to advertise services
for Fedora-based systems (installation, configuration, troubleshooting,
etc.).

### Business cards {#_business_cards}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission
on business cards to accurately identify one's affiliation with the
Fedora Project.

### Promotional events {#_promotional_events}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission
to promote free and open source software events where individuals of the
Fedora Project appear as Fedora representatives, distribute Fedora
Materials, or otherwise represent the Fedora Project, provided the
Fedora Code of Conduct and the general guidelines above are followed. If
you would like to make some merchandise or swag to give away at the
event and don't already have a license to do so, please contact the
Fedora Council.

### Publications {#_publications}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks in the title and content
of a publication, provided that:

- the use is clearly in reference to the Fedora Project or Fedora
  Materials;

- the use does not suggest that the Fedora Project has published,
  endorsed, sponsored, or agrees with your work;

- the use does not purport to represent Fedora Project contributors as a
  group without permission from the Council; and

- proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora
  Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as
  explained in Proper Trademark Use below.

### Distributing Fedora Materials {#_distributing_fedora_materials}

#### Copies of unmodified Fedora Materials {#_copies_of_unmodified_fedora_materials}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission
to label unmodified Fedora Materials, provided proper trademark symbols
are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark
attribution statement appears as explained in Proper Trademark Use
below.

#### Distributing combinations of Fedora Materials with non-Fedora or modified Fedora Materials {#_distributing_combinations_of_fedora_materials_with_non_fedora_or_modified_fedora_materials}

Community members may use the Fedora Remix Trademarks on and in
conjunction with software that commingles unmodified Fedora Materials
with other software or content that is not provided officially by the
Fedora Project, or that provides modified Fedora Materials, provided
that:

- the fedora-logos, fedora-release, and fedora-release-notes RPM
  packages are removed, although you may replace these with packages of
  your own devising not containing the Fedora Trademarks; and

- a notice is prominently displayed indicating that:

  - the software provided is not provided or supported by the Fedora
    Project; and

  - official Fedora Materials are available through the Fedora Project
    website, and linking to the Fedora Project website at
    <https://fedoraproject.org/>.

#### OEM pre-loads of unmodified Fedora Materials {#_oem_pre_loads_of_unmodified_fedora_materials}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission
in connection with the provision and sale of computer systems pre-loaded
with Fedora Materials, provided that:

- any website advertising such systems follows the guidelines herein
  pertaining to [Business websites](#business-websites);

- the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by the Fedora
  Project or Red Hat;

- it is clear to the consumer of the computer system that there is no
  support available from the Fedora community other than that which is
  offered to all users;

- the use of the Fedora Trademarks does not imply an association with or
  endorsement of any non-Fedora goods or services;

- any non-Fedora Materials included as part of the install image must
  reside entirely within a single folder under /opt (e.g.
  /opt/VENDORNAME). Please note that this exception only applies to
  content and documentation, not code, fonts or firmware;

- proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora
  Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as
  explained in Proper Trademark Use below; and

- the [Fedora brand
  standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/) are
  strictly observed.

#### Virtual images or appliances with unmodified Fedora Materials {#_virtual_images_or_appliances_with_unmodified_fedora_materials}

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission
in connection with the provision and sale of virtual images or appliance
distributions pre-loaded with Fedora Materials, provided that:

- any website advertising such systems follows the guidelines herein
  pertaining to [Business websites](#business-websites);

- the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the
  Fedora Project;

- it is clear to the consumer of the computer system that there is no
  support available from the Fedora community other than that which is
  offered to all users;

- the use of the Fedora Trademarks does not imply an association with or
  endorsement of any non-Fedora goods or services;

- no non-Fedora Materials are pre-installed in the virtual image or
  appliance files in which the Fedora operating system is pre-loaded,
  but instead are provided by separate distribution. This requirement
  does not include minor, nonmaterial changes necessary to run in the
  particular hosting environment;

- proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora
  Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as
  explained in Proper Trademark Use below; and the [Fedora brand
  standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/) are
  strictly observed.

## Secondary Marks {#_secondary_marks}

### Fedora Remix {#_fedora_remix}

Downstream distributors may use the Fedora Remix word mark and the
Fedora Remix logo ("Fedora Remix Trademarks") to indicate their work
includes or is derived from Fedora Materials, and thereby drive more
interest in the Fedora Project itself, so long as:

- a statement is included in a prominent location stating that end users
  are receiving modified Fedora Materials, and informing them where they
  can get unmodified Fedora Materials;

- your name or company name and brand is more prominently featured than
  the Fedora Remix Trademarks; use does not express or imply sponsorship
  or endorsement by, or affiliation or a relationship with the Fedora
  Project; and

- the [Fedora brand
  standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/) are
  strictly observed.

Other uses that do not properly indicate the work contains modified
Fedora Material or non-Fedora material are not permitted. Other uses of
any Fedora Trademarks to refer to work that includes or is derived from
Fedora Materials are not permitted.

### Fedora Ready {#_fedora_ready}

Fedora Ready word mark and the Fedora Ready logo ("Fedora Ready
Trademarks") allow approved, current members of the [Fedora Ready
program](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/marketing/ready/) to
promote and advertise their participation in the program.

Approved, current members of the Fedora Ready program may use the Fedora
Ready Trademarks in marketing, websites and social media so long as:

- your name or company name and brand is more prominently featured than
  the Fedora Remix Trademarks;

- use does not express or imply sponsorship or endorsement by, or
  affiliation or a relationship with the Fedora Project;

- you are a member in good standing of the Fedora Ready program and in
  compliance with all Fedora Ready program requirements; and

- the [Fedora brand
  standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/) are
  strictly observed.

Permanently affixing the Fedora Ready trademark to hardware or using the
Fedora Ready trademarks on merchandise or other promotional items
requires permission from the Council.

## Proper Trademark Use {#_proper_trademark_use}

- Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun. Don't use a
  trademark as a verb. Don't use \"a\" or \"the\" to refer to an
  instance of the trademark.

- Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling
  and never abbreviate, hyphenate, or combine trademarks with any other
  words or designs.

- Always distinguish trademarks from the surrounding text, either by
  capitalizing, bolding, italicizing, or underlining the trademark.

- Don't pluralize a trademark. Don't use a trademark as a possessive.

- Don't create acronyms using the Fedora Trademarks.

- Don't alter, modify, abbreviate, or make variations of the Fedora
  Trademarks.

- Put the following notice in the footer of the page where you have used
  a Fedora Trademark Mark (or, if in a book, on the credits page), on
  any packaging or labeling, and on advertising or marketing materials:
  \"\[List of marks\] is/are \[a\] trademark\[s\] or registered
  trademark\[s\] of Red Hat, Inc., or its subsidiaries in the United
  States and other countries.\"

- In the case of a registered trademark, the first or most prominent
  mention of the Fedora Trademark on a web page, document, packaging, or
  documentation must be accompanied by a symbol indicating the Fedora
  Trademark is registered (\"®\").

### Logo Usage Guidelines {#_logo_usage_guidelines}

For more information about the requirements for logo size, appearance,
placement, and other considerations, refer to the [Fedora brand
standards](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/).

## Questions? {#_questions}

If you have any questions about these Guidelines or you would like to
speak to someone about the use of the Fedora Trademarks in ways not
described in these Guidelines, please [contact the Fedora
Council](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/contact/).
