= Overview of the Fedora Infrastructure

== Architecture

\&#42; xref:map_critical_services.adoc[Map of critical services]
\&#42; xref:services.adoc[List of our services]

== Tooling

Most of the tooling we use in Fedora infrastructure is described in
xref:developer_guide:index.adoc[Developer Guide]. Above that we also use Ansible
to maintain our https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible[ansible repository].

== Good Practices

See xref:developer_guide:index.adoc[Developer Guide] for good practices regarding development work
for Fedora Infrastructure.

And see xref:sysadmin_guide:index.adoc[Sysadmin Guide] for good practices regarding sysadmin work
for Fedora Infrastructure.


= Working with Fedora Infrastructure

This document explains how to efficiently work with the Fedora Infrastructure team.
Your close attention to this document will help both you and us
do the work you are asking us to do.

== Our Workflow

=== Security related issues
Is your issue/problem related to security of an application or service we
run?

\&#42; send an email to infra-security@fedoraproject.org

=== Emergency/Authentication issues
Is your issue/problem urgent? (An important service is down, you need
a change asap) or is your issue/problem such that you cannot file a ticket
(authentication, no account, ticketing system down)

\&#42; Login to a matrix account. join the \&#35;admin:fedoraproject.org channel.
say '!oncall' and explain the issue or problem to the oncall person.

\&#42; If no one is available there:
\&#42;\&#42; If you cannot authenticate to link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/[], send an email
to admin@fedoraproject.org
\&#42;\&#42; Otherwise: go to next step.

=== Ticket tracking

By default, the infrastructure team tracks its work in tickets at:
link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues/[].
If you need something from us, please
link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues/[open a new ticket] with
as much information as you think is needed to process this request.

Once created your ticket will follow the following flow:

.Daily Process Ticket Flow
[\&#35;img-ticket-flow]
[caption='Figure_2:_']
image::daily_process.png[750,750, link='../_images/daily_process.png']

A few notes:

\&#42; Make sure to note if there is a deadline or if this issue blocks you.
\&#42; We review tickets during the two stand ups we hold Monday through Thursday
(one more Europe timezone friendly and one more US timezone friendly).
\&#42; There is no need to ping team members or notify us about the newly filed
ticket.

\&#42; Your ticket will be triaged by a team member and moved to a new state:
\&#42;\&#42; A Gain and Pain levels will be added to the ticket, these are used by the
team member to prioritize their work. (You can find the definition of each
level in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/glossary/[glossary].)
\&#42;\&#42; If it's moved to _Waiting on asignee_ it's waiting for a team member to
start working on it.
\&#42;\&#42; If it's moved to _Waiting on reporter_ it means that you need to answer
questions posed in the ticket before it can be worked on.
\&#42;\&#42; If the ticket is closed with _initiative_, see
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/initiatives/[New Initiative Workflow].
\&#42;\&#42; If the ticket is otherwise closed, it will be with a explanation from
a team member.


\&#42; If you have an update to your issue/task or want to know when it might be
worked on:
\&#42;\&#42; comment in the ticket adding that information or asking for time frame.

\&#42; When someone is available, your ticket will be assigned to someone to work
on.
\&#42;\&#42; Watch for progress reports/ticket being marked done.

\&#42; If the work is not fully completed as required, please re-open the ticket
and indicate this.
\&#42;\&#42; Go back to the previous step for additional work.


== The 'Oncall' Role in Our Team

One team member is always designated “oncall”. The assigned person changes
every week. You can find who the currently assigned person is on matrix by using
\&#96;!oncall\&#96; in any of our various matrix channels, such as \&#96;\&#35;admin:fedoraproject.org\&#96;

When available, this person:

. Accepts urgent work items for the team, such as an important
or high SLE service being down or causing issues. A ticket should
be filed by the reporter or the oncall person to track this work in any case.

. Shields other team members from distracting pings and less
urgent tickets, deciding when an issue is important enough to
interrupt another team member.

. Triages incoming tickets for urgent items that need work outside
of normal triage process.

== Initiatives

All tasks involving new applications, major deployments, major development work
or the like will be asked to follow the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/initiatives/[New Initiative Workflow].
It will then be scoped and prioritized from there.

== General Ticket Considerations

Please provide as much information as you can in your ticket to avoid
back and forth for information. If you know your issue is going to
cause a lot of discussion, start a mailing list or discussion thread for that.

Make sure your ticket:

\&#42; Explains the problem or issue you are having, with URLs where
possible to the services or applications involved.
\&#42; Tells us how important or urgent this is to you.
\&#42; Includes any error messages or output you see.

It is your responsibility as ticket reporter to follow your ticket, provide
information that is asked for, and keep us aware of any urgency you may have.
Do not simply file and forget your ticket.

Your ticket may take a while to process, depending on the current workload
of the team has and how important we think it is. If your ticket
is blocking you, make sure you note that in the ticket, but keep in
mind that we may already be working on tickets that are blocking more people.

Every now and then, we will go through our old tickets. When this happen we may
ask you to check if the issue still exists (it could be that a complimentary
change fixed it, or that was just an intermittent issue or simply that it got
fixed without us knowing). In those situation, we kindly ask that you reply to
our question/ping within two weeks, otherwise we reserve the right to close the
ticket (knowing that you can always re-open it or open a new one if the issue
persists or re-appeared).

== Matrix

Matrix is a great way to communicate, but please do not ping team members
directly. Instead, update your ticket with any new information you have and
when the team member(s) working on that issue have time/availability, they
may contact you on matrix for more interactive debugging/testing.

== Direct emails

E-mail is also a great communication method, but if you mail work items or
information to one person directly, they cannot easily hand off the issue,
you must wait for them to have time to address the issue (when others could
perhaps have already solved it, etc). So, please avoid direct emails and
instead update tickets with any information you want to add.

== RFC 1149

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149[Pigeons are too slow] for most work
items, and require facilities (e.g. dovecots) that most team members do not
have. Even if the oncall member does have a free dovecot, feed, and is trained
in handling carrier pigeons, sending a pigeon to a single team member has the
same problems as using matrix or email for the same purpose, which means tickets
are still the correct way to report problems.

In other words, please don't send us any birds.


= Join the Fedora Infrastructure

Fedora is known for creating and using new technologies. The Infrastructure
team helps build many of these new technologies and uses many of them on a
regular basis. We are always interested in discussing these technologies
from an academic and theoretical perspective.

If you're ready to work with the Fedora Infrastructure team we're looking
for smart, dedicated system administrators and developers to help maintain
our systems and write code. The Fedora Infrastructure team is a perfect way
to give back to the community! So what are you waiting for? Take a look at
our https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/GettingStarted[Getting Started Page]!


= Getting Started with Infrastructure

times in the Fedora Infrastructure team. What fun stuff will you do to
support and grow the Fedora community?

\&#42; You will help design and implement highly available and fault-tolerant
systems
\&#42; Fix system issues for grateful Fedora developers
\&#42; Maintain the servers that make the Fedora Project possible
\&#42; Create and maintain custom tools and applications to automate systems
maintenance
\&#42; Create and maintain tools and applications to enhance and grow the
Fedora community

The skills you should possess or be willing to learn to do this work
include:

\&#42; Being polite
\&#42; Being patient
\&#42; How to help fellow hackers
\&#42; How to write systems administration scripts
\&#42; How to write web applications

\&#42;\&#42; Other equivalent technologies are welcome
\&#42;\&#42; We can especially use skills in this area or folks that are willing
to learn
\&#42; How the Fedora Project works 'behind the scenes'

It would be great if

\&#42; You have previous systems admin experience
\&#42; Have access to your own testing machines
\&#42;\&#42; Our resources are limited, especially for testing!
\&#42; Work in other areas of Fedora like packaging or documentation

== Getting Started

See below for a list of steps or head down to the xref:gettingstarted.adoc\&#35;_quickstart[Quick
Start] section if you just want to submit a single change or fix.

== First steps

\&#42; First you will need to read through and understand
link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/contribute/successful-contributor/[how to be a successful contributor].
\&#42; Next you will need to create a link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/user/[Fedora Account]:
\&#42;\&#42; This account will be used for just about everything you do as a
member of the Fedora Community
\&#42;\&#42; You will need it to sign the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement[FPCA]
which is required to contribute to the Fedora Community
\&#42;\&#42; You will need it to login to various systems associated with the Infrastructure Group
\&#42;\&#42; You will need it to upload code changes, make changes to this wiki and etc.
\&#42; After you have created your account and signed the FPCA, you should then subscribe to the
link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/infrastructure.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Infrastructure Mailing List]
and you should check the link:https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tags/c/project/7/infrastructure-team[Infrastructure tag at Fedora Discussion].
\&#42;\&#42; This is the mailing list you will use to send your introduction email to the Fedora
Infrastructure Team as well as communicate with other team members on a regular basis.
\&#42;\&#42; When you are ready to send a [introduction to the group](mailto:infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org),
\&#42;\&#42; your subject should be 'Meeting Agenda Item: Introduction _Your Name_'.
The message body should include:
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Your Matrix handle
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; link:https://fedoramagazine.org/join-the-conversation/[Fedora's Matrix instance at chat.fedoraproject.org]
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; What skills you have to offer and which you would like to learn. This can include\&#8230;
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Programming languages you are familiar with or have used
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Systems administration skills, certifications, and technologies you have or have used (or wish to learn)
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Any associations you have (e.g. local hackerspace/makerspace, Linux User Groups, employer, etc.)
\&#42;\&#42; What you want to learn
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; What you would like to work on and quite possibly which link:http://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues[outstanding issues] you would like to help resolve
\&#42;\&#42; Any initial questions you have for the team
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Look at the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/[Fedora Infrastructure Best Practices] document
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Be patient, as sometimes folks are busy and might not reply to your email quickly. You may get a faster response on Matrix.
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; join the \&#35;admin:fedoraproject.org channel on matrix and attend the next matrix meeting.
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Watch link:http://fedoramagazine.org/?p=642[some videos] intended to introduce new contributors to
the team.

== What is next?

After you've completed the steps outlined in the xref:gettingstarted.adoc\&#35;_first_steps[First steps
section] you should:

\&#42; Regularly attend the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Meetings[Weekly Meetings]
on Matrix and be sure to introduce yourself the first time you attend. There is a section at the
start of the meeting where you can give a short introduction of yourself to the rest of the team.
\&#42; Take some time to learn about the link:[services]https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/map_critical_services/
the Fedora Infrastructure Group develops, deploys and maintains.
\&#42; Ask about joining the xref:apprentice.adoc[Fedora Infrastructure Apprentice] (fi-apprentice) group.
\&#42; Read up on link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/\&#35;_standard_operating_procedures[SOPs]
you find interesting. These are a good point of reference for hosts related to an app. They give an overview
of how things work for that app.
\&#42; Idle in matrix and chime in with questions or offers to help when you see an interesting problem being discussed.

If you don't have the time to be involved on a regular basis at this point, please feel free to watch over
things and report bugs and RFEs as you see fit. Showing interest now is a great way to make it easier to
join the team's activities later!

== QuickStart

\&#42; If you just want to make a single change or fix a single issue, then
just jump right in at attach a patch for it to the existing issue, or
post a patch to the mailing list. Note that we still would like you to
create an account and sign the FPCA so we can properly license your
contributions.

== How the team works

The Fedora Infrastructure Group consists of volunteers and Red Hat employees. Our preferred
method of communication is matrix though we also heavily use the Fedora Mailing
List.
We try to be as transparent as possible and default to open.

New members are encouraged to join the list, use the discourse, Matrix and attend meetings.

Asking questions (in any of our public areas: Matrix, lists, meetings) is encouraged. Unless there's an outage
or people are busy we are happy to try and explain how something is setup or works.

The team is a meritocracy, which means those people who solve issues and do work are given more privileges over time. In
general don't worry about the access and privileges, instead, try and solve problems and prove that you will be around
and reliable over time and you will be setup with what you need to do that work. Since we are a small team we don't
usually have the cycles to do full time mentoring of new contributors, so you will be expected to be a 'self-starter'
and able to gather information on your own. We are happy to answer questions when you get stuck.


:infra-matrix: https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;admin:fedoraproject.org

= Infrastructure Apprentice

The 'fi-apprentice' group in the Fedora Account System is one with a lot of read-only access to various
Fedora infrastructure machines. This group is used for new folks to look around at the infrastructure setup,
check machines and processes and see where they might like to contribute moving forward. This also allows
apprentices to examine and gather info on problems, then propose solutions.

== Access to many infrastructure machines

Members of the fi-apprentice group have ssh/shell access to many machines, but no sudo rights or ability
to commit to ansible (but they do have read-only access). Apprentice can, however, contribute to the
infrastructure documentation by sending pull requests to the link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/docs[docs]
repository. Access is via the bastion.fedoraproject.org machine and from there to each machine. See the
link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/sshaccess/[SSH Access Infrastructure SOP] for more
info. You can see a list of hosts that allow apprentice access by using:
\&#96;./scripts/hosts_with_var_set -i inventory/ -o ipa_client_shell_groups=fi-apprentice\&#96;
from an ansible repo checkout (see below).

== Nagios alerts

This group does NOT get Nagios alerts. If you would like to see them you can join the \&#35;fedora-noc channel, adjust your
link:https://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications[FMN notifications settings] or watch the Nagios web interface at:
link:https://admin.fedoraproject.org/nagios/[] and link:https://nagios-external.fedoraproject.org/nagios/[]

Nagios access is now controlled by kerberos, so you will need to do a command with “kinit your_fas_name@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG”.
On the use of the kerberos, you can view the page link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Kerberos[]

== Length of membership

Members who have not logged into any machine and/or are not active will be removed. There's nothing personal
in this, and you're welcome to re-join later when you have more time, we just want to make sure the group only
has active members.

== Longer term quests

There's a few items we need help with ongoing and apprentices are encouraged to work on these items and provide patches
and ask questions, etc. The current list:

\&#42; Update group variables in ansible for CSI standards for machines that don't have any listed. See:
link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Community_Services_Infrastructure/1/html/Security_Policy/index.html[]
for information on CSI, and look at the ansible repo under inventory/group_vars/ for groups without CSI information.
Patches adding this information for groups can be sent to the infrastructure list to be reviewed and applied. Please
refer to link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Standards_for_documenting_CSI_variables[standards for documenting CSI variables] before submitting patches
for ansible.

\&#42; Our docs aren't all using the same template. See the link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/docs[docs] repo and propose patches
to update documents to use the same templates as the rest.

\&#42; Look over our logs on log01.rdu3.fedoraproject.org in /var/log/merged/ and track down issues and propose solutions to
them. Be sure to discuss in meeting or in a issue whatever you find.

== Working on a ticket workflow

\&#42; Pick a ticket

Look in link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues[] for a ticket that looks interesting to you. If the ticket is already assigned, but hasn't
had any action in a while, feel free to ask on the ticket if it's still being worked on, and if there is no reply in a week or so, take it over.
Some tickets can be worked on by several people, so feel free to ask in ticket if this is one of those kinds of tasks and what part you can work
on. If a ticket seems really old and like it may no longer be needed, please add it to the agenda of the next meeting and we will discuss it
there and close it or rework it as needed. You can add to the next meeting agenda at the link:https://board.net/p/fedora-infra[fedora-infra board].

\&#42; Make patch for fix from git ansible repo

Most any task will require changes to ansible. You can check this out on batcave01.rdu3.fedoraproject.org
(just 'git clone /git/ansible' there) and make edits to your local copy. Then you can create a PR with your changes into link:https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible[]

== Matrix Tips

The primary way the infrastructure team communicates is Matrix. Here's a few tips to best communicate with the rest of the team:

\&#42; Feel free to ask questions when you think of them/run into them, but don't expect everyone to drop what they are doing and answer right then.
Please be patient.

\&#42; Try to avoid private messages to specific team members. Instead ask your questions in link:{infra-matrix}[Fedora Infrastructure Team']
and link:https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;noc:fedoraproject.org['Fedora Network Operation Center'] on Matrix if at all possible.
This allows anyone to help you out and also other folks to see the answer and peer review the answers you get.

\&#42; Try and assume best intentions on past decisions. There is often a reason for something being setup the way it is or there's some history
behind it. 'Have we considered switching from foo to bar?' is great, 'Why are you using foo! bar is better, we should switch to it right now'
is not.

\&#42; Keep in mind many of the infrastructure folks are busy, so do try and avoid 'pinging' them unless there's a specific need or you know they are
active in channel. Many people have a matrix 'trigger' that notifies them when someone mentions their nick.

\&#42; Being active in Matrix and asking questions is a great way to find out how things are setup and gain more trust.

\&#42; Watching discussion in Matrix can often lead to some topic or area you might be interested in helping out with.
If so, please feel free to chime in in channel that you would be interested in helping out and ask how you could
do so.

== Further information

For further information on this group, please ask in \&#35;fedora-admin on irc.libera.chat, the link:{infra-matrix}[Fedora Infrastructure Matrix room]
and/or the fedora infrastructure xref:index.adoc\&#35;_mailing_list[mailing list].

Ansible documentation is available at link:http://docs.ansible.com/[].

= Service Level Expectations

The infrastructure team does not have any formal agreement or contract regarding
the availability of its different services. However, we do try our best to keep
services running, and as a result, you can have some expectations as to what
we will do to this extent.

== Primary Business Hours

Fedora Infrastructure is a community team, involving volunteers as well as
people employed by Red Hat to work on Fedora.
However, despite the help of volunteers, primary business hours are mostly
aligned with the work schedule of Red Hat. Normal hours should be seen as
Monday through Friday from 1000 UTC to 2300 UTC, excluding US/EU national holidays
and a 2 weeks end of year closure affecting staffing and response times.

Services outside of primary business hours are done on call and depend on
the availability of staff.

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== Fedora Infrastructure to Community

\&#42; To have staff present and available in appropriate communication channels to answer
questions during primary hours.
\&#42; Interact with community members with respect and courtesy.
\&#42; Work with community members to get accurate and thorough documentation of
incidents, problems, or feature requests.
\&#42; Resolve reported problems as soon as acknowledged if possible.
\&#42; Clearly communicate estimated resolution times.
\&#42; Move items which can not be resolved within a reasonable time to future
feature requests or close out.

=== Community Members to Fedora Infrastructure

\&#42; Provide full and detailed reports of the problem or requested service.
\&#42; Provide clear and complete contact information and times when available.
\&#42; Leave alternative contacts who can also be available in case of vacation
or other emergencies.
\&#42; When contacted by Fedora IT, respond back within 5 business days.

=== Fedora Infrastructure to Fedora Infrastructure

\&#42; Have a clear schedule of reachable hours.
\&#42; Set and take regular vacation time to be rested.
\&#42; Rotate through days on-call in matrix and tickets.
\&#42; If adding a new service, be available outside of normal business hours to
help debug problems.
\&#42; Follow procedures and checklists when adding or updating services.
\&#42; Help with regular audits of the documentation

== Definition of Service Priorities

The general design of service priorities is that of concentric circles, where
items rely on services in their own circle or a circle below them.

. \&#42;Critical\&#42; services are ones which Fedora Infrastructure will work to be available
24x7 with a 52 week coverage if an unplanned outage occurs.
Services will be configured to be highly available with an estimated
planned/unplanned uptime of 95%. Response time should be within 1 hour during business
hours. Outside business hours this will be addressed when the Fedora infra staff is
available.
. \&#42;Important\&#42; services are ones which Fedora Infrastructure will work to be
available 24x7 with a 50 week coverage. Response time should be within a day
during business days. Outside business days this will be addressed when the
Fedora infra staff is available.
. \&#42;Normal\&#42; services are ones which Fedora Infrastructure will work to be
available during primary work hours. Problems outside of these hours will
be looked at as people are available. The services may be available
outside of these but are of a lower priority than important services.
. \&#42;Low priority\&#42; services are ones which are not critical or important for
the primary function of Fedora Infrastructure. They will be worked on and
looked at during primary business hours.
. \&#42;Third Party\&#42; services are ones which Fedora Infrastructure has outsourced
tools and services to. Uptimes, service hours, and coverage are dictated
by the third party. Depending on the type of problem, Fedora Infrastructure
will act as an intermediary, or in the case of tools like retrace and COPR,
direct the user to talk with the service owners.
. \&#42;Deprecated\&#42; services are ones which Fedora Infrastructure are no longer
putting resources into. This may be because the project has completed its
mission, the upstream software is dead, or the original reasons for the
service no longer exists. Problems with these services will be looked at
during primary business hours. Responses may be mostly 'Will Not Fix'.

== Limitations on Support

\&#42; Some services that are associated with Fedora are provided by third
parties. Changes and outages which affect them are outside the control
of Fedora Infrastructure.
\&#42; Fedora Infrastructure will prioritize issues and requests that affect
multiple people or teams over a smaller group or individual.
\&#42; Fedora Infrastructure has limited budget and hours. Requests and features
will be prioritized to fit within those.
\&#42; Fedora Infrastructure is bound by the laws and regulations of the United
States of America. This means that certain requests, changes and problems
are outside the ability of members to deal with.

== Glossary

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Planned outage\&#42;\&#42;: A planned outage is one that is announced sufficiently
ahead of time to allow most users to plan around it.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Unplanned outage\&#42;\&#42;: An outage that occurs suddenly without proper
allowance for users to plan around it.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Scheduled outage\&#42;\&#42;: An outage which has been scheduled to occur, but may
not have been announced with enough time for users to plan around it.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;High Availability\&#42;\&#42;: Systems are available during specified operating
hours with any unplanned outages 'masked' by other tools.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Continuous Operations\&#42;\&#42;: Systems are available 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, with no scheduled outages. Unplanned outages are possible during
this time.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Continuous Availability\&#42;\&#42;: Systems or applications are available 24x7
with no planned or unplanned outages. This is a combination of high
availability and continuous operations.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Level of availability\&#42;\&#42;:

[options=header]
|===
|Percentage | Max outage time per day
| 90%       | 144.0 minutes
| 95%       | 72.0 minutes
| 99%       | 14.4 minutes
| 99.9%     | 1.4 minutes
|===

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Committed Hours of Availability\&#42;\&#42;: Hours that an organization will have
staff available to help deal with issues with systems, services, and
applications. Also known as 'Regular Business Hours'

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Outage Hours\&#42;\&#42;: Total number of hours of outage considered normal for
calculating achieved availability.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Response Time\&#42;\&#42;: The time between the users notification of the problem
and when the help desk will begin to work on that problem.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Resolution Update\&#42;\&#42;: The frequency of updates to tickets

== Estimated Time of Resolution:
By priority Levels:

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Emergency\&#42;\&#42;: Problems which are site wide, and affect the core functions
of the project. These problems are priority and should be solved as soon as possible.
Estimated time of resolution is within hours.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Urgent\&#42;\&#42;: Problems which affect multiple functions and groups in the
project. These problems will be solved when there is no emergency going on.
Estimated time of resolution is within a day.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Normal\&#42;\&#42;: Problems which affect a single user from performing needed
duties. These problems will be looked at when staff is available.
Estimated time resolution is within a week.

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Low\&#42;\&#42;: A request for service, instruction, information that has no
immediate impact on services. Those problems are lowest priority.
Estimated time of resolution is within a month.

=  User guide Communishift

The Communishift is a community
link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[OpenShift] instance hosted
by Fedora. It is meant to host PoC or test deployments for Fedora related projects.

== Request new namespace

To request a new namespace in Communishift go to
link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues[Fedora Infrastructure ticket tracker], open a
new issue and use \&#96;communishift\&#96; template (look at the \&#96;Types\&#96; field).

If you need any help with your OpenShift project, please refer to official
link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation].

With the namespace provided you will get following default resources:

\&#42; 1 CPU
\&#42; 1 Gi Memory (2 Gi limit)
\&#42; 5 Gi persistent storage

[NOTE]
====
Default resources were taken from communishift
link:https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible/blob/main/f/roles/communishift/tasks/create-resource-quota.yml[ansible playbook].
====

== Accessing and using OpenShift

Once your ticket for a new communishift namespace has been approved, you will be added to a FAS group for your new namespace. This will grant your FAS account the ability to sign into the https://console-openshift-console.apps.fedora.cj14.p1.openshiftapps.com/[OpenShift Portal] to access your new namespace.

https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/web_console/web-console.html[OpenShift web console documentation] is available if you are new to using the openshift web console and would like to read more about the platform.

== Removal of the projects

All the projects on Communishift will be deleted every Fedora Linux release (6 months). If you need
more than 6 months for your project, please open a ticket on
link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues[Fedora Infrastructure ticket tracker] and explain
why your project should not be deleted.

== Request for additional resources

There is a quota set per project. In case you need additional resources for your project please
open a ticket on
link:https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues[Fedora Infrastructure ticket tracker] with
information about how much resources you need and why you need them.

== Service usage requirements

Following is the list of requirements you need to meet with your project to be allowed to have it
on Communishift. If the project violates any of those requirements it will rejected and in case it's already
running in Communishift it will be deleted.

. No malicious software
+
Don't use the namespace to host malicious service.
+
. Project needs to have some relation to Fedora project
+
Your project needs to be related to Fedora project. It could be either proof of concept for new Fedora
service, test deployment for new Fedora service or some service that could be useful for Fedora community.
+
. No violation of community policies or code of conduct
+
Your project needs to adhere to link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/[Fedora community policies]
and link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/[Fedora Code of Conduct].
+
. Do not store or handle personal data on Communishift instance
+
We as Fedora are obligated to follow GDPR related requests and we don't have a way to do that in community
managed services. If your service demands to work with user data for any reason, please use FAS for authentication
and don't store anything on Communishift side.

Note that this list is not exhaustive, there may be other reasons we disable or delete your application,
but we will make every effort to communicate with you about any such actions.
