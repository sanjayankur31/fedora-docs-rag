# Purpose {#_purpose}

The team takes care maintenance and development of websites and
applications while constantly keeping up with UI/UX reviews, mentoring
contributors and organizing meetings.

# Function {#_function}

1.  Multiple contributors from Design team, Fedora Infra, Red Hat's Open
    Source Program Office and Community Platform Engineering team etc.
    have been participating in discussions over at the chatroom.

2.  Websites have been maintained in their current state and operations
    on translations/content/verification are continually performed while
    keeping up with the relevant release cycle of Fedora Linux.

3.  Contributor onboarding and retention, active communication with the
    outer community on Discussion fp.o. regarding planning topics and
    retrospective feedback on tasks have been actively performed.

4.  Members, Akashdeep Dhar and Francois Andrieu have been instrumental
    in mentoring an intern, Subhangi Choudhary to revamp the web
    application used for aggregating IRC meeting logs and summaries.

5.  Members, Michael Scherer and Onuralp Sezer have been instrumental in
    mentoring an intern, Ojong Enow to assist with maintaining a certain
    set of websites and rebooting the websites/apps index.

6.  With active representation in the events like Nest With Fedora and
    Fedora Linux Release Parties, the team had been reaching out to
    garner more feedback on the work done so far and acquire
    contributors for assistance.

# Meetings {#_meetings}

The team members collaborate periodically over synchronous and
asynchronous meetings.

## Video conference meetings {#video-conference}

The Websites & Apps Engineering Team meets weekly as long as there are
at least four active participants available. Should that not be the
case - updates, plans and blockers are conveyed asynchronously in the
Fedora Chat channel by the members.

## Details {#conference-details}

- Location - [**{COMMS-VIDEO-NAME} room**]({COMMS-VIDEO})

- Day - **{MEETING-DAY}s**

- Time - **{MEETING-TIME}**

## Agenda

A video conference meeting is a fleeting affair and hence, it is
important to use every moment of the meeting wisely to discuss important
topics.

### Flow of discussion {#_flow_of_discussion}

## How to chair team meetings? {#_how_to_chair_team_meetings}

Anyone can be a chair for the Websites and Apps Engineering Team, and we
encourage everyone to try chairing our weekly team meetings at least
once to get an experience. The team is supportive of newcomers and
experienced folks alike who are trying to chair a meeting for the first
time so one needs not worry about anything going wrong midway.

The chair should

- Be one of the first ones to join the meeting as they would be the ones
  coordinating with the attendees and carrying the meeting forward

- Have the agenda document open on a side to read topics from, add names
  to the agenda list and make notes/summaries/action-items discussed on

- Make sure that all the points from the slated agenda are discussed
  during the meeting and that the action items, if any, are accounted
  for

- Ensure that the attendees feel comfortable enough and get a fair
  amount of time to put their points forward and that there points are
  considered

- Act as an arbitrator to settle disputes, if there are any, among the
  attendees and try best to reach the middle ground by avoiding
  conflicts.

- Keep track of \"raised hands\" in order to ensure that every attendee
  in the meeting get their opportunity to speak in the order of \"hands
  raised\"

- Let the team know well in advance if they are not able to make it to
  the meeting that they volunteered to chair for to help get a
  replacement

- Attempt to prevent diversions in the meeting, be them caused by either
  themselves or the attendees and try to maximally utilize the meeting
  time

- Motivate communication in an accessible manner - so folks who are
  unwilling to use camera and/or microphone should be encouraged to use
  the chat

- Conduct an in-meeting poll, discussion, opinions, debate in an
  unbiased and fair manner to all the attendees to avoid any possible
  conflicts

- Feel comfortable to pass on their turn to someone else mid-meeting,
  should something important come up or if they cannot attend anymore

- Avoid a survivorship bias by passing on the updates shared and
  progresses made on the meeting to the wider community using relevant
  channels

- Make notes on the developments made in a meeting, summarize
  discussions, plans and action items, or find an assignee from the
  attendees to do it

- Ensure that they are attending the meeting from a noise-free and
  disturbance-free environment and are not distracted by any other work
  or social media

- Use an accessible and simple vocabulary to convey their statements for
  maximum participation, and wait enough after each point for attendees
  to reflect

## Participation guidelines {#guidelines}

- Please focus on listening, and on appreciating what others are trying
  to say, not only on what you are hearing.

- Wherever possible, please refrain from multitasking on email or social
  media and strive to remain fully present and tuned in to what others
  are saying and feeling.

- Please assume best intent in everyone's comments and strive to keep a
  constructive tone in your own.

- Please use simple, accessible language. In particular, please avoid
  jargon and acronyms, so that all may fully participate.

- When you speak, please make just one point and then let others speak.
  We want everyone to have an equal chance to speak. In a group of \"n\"
  people, speak no more than \"1/nth\" of the time.

- Please speak for yourself when making comments, using \"I\". Please
  don't speak for the assembled group by speaking as \"we\".

- Help us be mindful of the schedule and stay on time; we anticipate
  many people will have much they want to say, but please support us in
  moving the dialog forward.

## Please be a self-aware participant! {#self-aware}

- Please indicate you want to speak by raising your hand on video or
  with the button in Jitsi Meet; if you are not able to use or raise
  your hand, feel free to speak up but please try not to interrupt
  others.

- Please stay muted when you are not speaking.

- Please be mindful of background noise and join the call from a quiet
  location. Construction sites, windy gardens and non-quarantined
  internet cafes do not qualify as quiet locations.

- All parents and caregivers shall enjoy an irrevocable
  \"background/foreground kid and dependent noise\" exception at all
  times, but muting etiquette still applies.

## Our tools {#tools}

Following is a list of tools that we make use of.

### Genshi

Genshi is a template engine for XML-based vocabularies written in
Python. Genshi is used to easily insert generated output into XML-based
languages, usually HTML, and reuse elements between documents. Genshi's
syntax is based on Kid, but its architecture is different.

### LXML

The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2
and libxslt. It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature
completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python
API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API.

### Jinja

Jinja is a web template engine for the Python programming language. It
was created by Armin Ronacher and is licensed under a BSD License. Jinja
is similar to the Django template engine but provides Python-like
expressions while ensuring that the templates are evaluated in a
sandbox.

### Frozen Flask {#frozen}

Frozen-Flask freezes a Flask application into a set of static files. The
result can be hosted without any server-side software other than a
traditional web server. Frozen-Flask is only about deployment: you can
use Frozen-Flask to only have static HTML files on your server.

### Python RSS {#rss}

RSS (Rich Site Summary) is a format for delivering regularly changing
web content. Many news-related sites, weblogs and other online
publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed to whoever wants it.
Feedparser and similar libraries are made use of while using Python 3.

### Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a
microframework because it does not require particular tools or
libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any
other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common
functions.

### SCSS/CSS {#scss}

SCSS stands for the Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. The more advanced
variant of CSS is SCSS. It was created by Chris Eppstein and Natalie
Weizenbaum and designed by Hampton Catlin. It is also referred to as
Sassy CSS due to its advanced features.

### Python 3 {#python}

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design
philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to
help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
projects.

### Antora

Antora is a modular, multi-repository site generator designed for
creating documentation sites from content composed in AsciiDoc® and
processed with Asciidoctor. Antora's toolchain and workflow help
documentation and engineering teams manage documentation sites.

### AsciiDoctor

Asciidoctor is a fast, open source, Ruby-based text processor for
parsing AsciiDoc® into a document model and converting it to output
formats such as HTML 5, DocBook 5, manual pages, PDF, EPUB 3, and other
formats. Docs of the said format are fed into Antora for being parsed.

### Make

In software development, Make is a build automation tool that
automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code
by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target
program. It remains widely used amidst the more prevalent IDE build
features.

### Podman

Podman is an open-source project that is available on most Linux
platforms and resides on GitHub. Podman is a daemonless container engine
for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI)
containers and container images on your Linux System.

### Ansible

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration
management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as
code. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both
Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

### HTML

The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
languages such as JavaScript for enhancing the design or adding
interactivity.

### JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one
of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

# How to add the Fedora Annual Survey Banner {#_how_to_add_the_fedora_annual_survey_banner}

## Add into start.fedoraproject.org {#_add_into_start_fedoraproject_org}

- [fedora-websites](https://pagure.io/fedora-websites) repo, [**Start
  Fedora Project**](https://start.fedoraproject.org):

- data/templates/docs-header.html

- add a div with the link information

- `<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 bluebox border">`

- NOTE: use col-sm-3 instead of 4 to fit 4 elements

- this will make it consistent with other on the page

- NOTE: for future modifications, check how the text renders when the
  browser window is smaller or on mobile.

- could be partially fixed by clamping font sizes

## How to remove the Fedora Annual Survey Banner {#_how_to_remove_the_fedora_annual_survey_banner}

### Removing From start.fedoraproject.org {#_removing_from_start_fedoraproject_org}

- In [fedora-websites](https://pagure.io/fedora-websites) repo, go to
  [**Start Fedora Project**](https://start.fedoraproject.org):

- edit data/templates/docs-header.html

- remove div and containing elements for the survey

- make sure to change the class to
  `<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 bluebox border">`

### Second method {#_second_method}

:::: note
::: title
:::

MIGHT NOT WORK, CURRENTLY TESTING THIS WITH NEST BANNER
::::

- add a image to the data/content/index.html within the grey container

- use the class `col-xs-12 top-margin` and set padding with
  `style="padding:10px 0"`

- make the image responsive by giving it
  `style="max-width:832px; width:100%`

# Websites Release (Legacy) {#_websites_release_legacy}

## Preparing the website for a new release cycle {#_preparing_the_website_for_a_new_release_cycle}

- Obsolete GPG key

  One month after a Fedora release the release number \'FXX-2\' (i.e. 1
  month after F21 release, F19 will be EOL) will be EOL (End of Life).
  At this point we should drop the GPG key from the list in `verify/`
  and move the keys to the obsolete keys page in keys/obsolete.html.

- Update GPG key

  After another couple of weeks and as the next release approaches,
  watch the fedora-release package for a new key to be added. Use the
  update-gpg-keys script in the fedora-web git repository to add it to
  `static/`. Manually add it to `/keys` and `/verify` in all websites
  where we use these keys: **arm.fpo** getfedora.org **labs.fpo**
  spins.fpo

- Steps

  - Get a copy of the new key(s) from the fedora-release repo, you will
    find FXX-primary and FXX-secondary keys. Save them in `./tools` to
    make the update easier. <https://pagure.io/fedora-repos>

  - Start by editing `./tools/update-gpg-keys` and adding the key-ids of
    any obsolete keys to the obsolete_keys list.

  - Then run that script to add the new key(s) to the fedora.gpg block:

        fedora-web git:(master) cd tools/
        tools git:(master) ./update-gpg-keys RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-23-primary
        tools git:(master) ./update-gpg-keys RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-23-secondary

    This will add the key(s) to the keyblock in `static/fedora.gpg` and
    create a text file for the key in `static/$KEYID.txt` as well.
    Verify that these files have been created properly and contain all
    the keys that they should.

  - Handy checks:

        gpg static/fedora.gpg

        or

        gpg static/$KEYID.txt

  - Adding `--with-fingerprint` option will add the fingerprint to the
    output

    The output of fedora.gpg should contain only the actual keys, not
    the obsolete keys. The single text files should contain the correct
    information for the uploaded key.

  - Next, add new key(s) to the list in `data/verify.html` and move the
    new key informations in the keys page in
    `data/content/keys/index.html`. A script to aid in generating the
    HTML code for new keys is in `./tools/make-gpg-key-html`. It will
    print HTML to stdout for each RPM-GPG-KEY-\* file given as
    arguments. This is suitable for copy/paste (or directly importing if
    your editor supports this). Check the copied HTML code and select if
    the key info is for a primary or secondary key (output says
    \'Primary or Secondary\').

        tools git:(master) ./make-gpg-key-html RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-23-primary

    Build the website with `make en test` and carefully verify that the
    data is correct. Please double check all keys in
    `http://localhost:5000/en/keys` and
    `http://localhost:5000/en/verify`.

    ::::: informalexample
    :::: note
    ::: title

    The tool will give you an outdated output, adapt it to the new
    websites and bootstrap layout!

### Update website for Alpha release {#_update_website_for_alpha_release}

- Create the fXX-alpha branch from master

      fedora-web git:(master) git push origin master:refs/heads/f23-alpha

  and checkout to the new branch:

      fedora-web git:(master) git checkout -t -b f23-alpha origin/f23-alpha

- Update the global variables changing `curr_state` to Alpha for all
  architectures.

- Add Alpha banner uploading it to `static/images/banners/f23alpha.png`
  which should appear in every `${PRODUCT}/download/index.html` page.
  Make sure the banner is shown in all sidebars, also in labs, spins,
  and arm.fp.o.

- Check all Download links and paths in
  `${PRODUCT}/prerelease/index.html` You can find all paths in bapp01
  (sudo su - mirrormanager first) or you can look at the downlaod page
  `http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage`

- Add CHECKSUM files to `static/checksums` and verify that the paths are
  correct. The files should be in sundries01 and you can query them
  with:

      $ find /pub/fedora/linux/releases/test/23-Alpha/ -type f -name \
      *CHECKSUM* -exec cp '{}' . \;

  Remember to add the right checksums to the right websites (same path).

- Add EC2 AMI IDs for Alpha. All IDs now are in the globalvar.py file.
  We get all data from there, even the redirect path to trac the AMI
  IDs. We now also have a script which is useful to get all the AMI IDs
  uploaded with fedimg. Execute it to get the latest uploads, but don't
  run the script too early, as new builds are added constantly.

      fedora-web git:(fXX-alpha) python ~/fedora-web/tools/get_ami.py

- Add CHECKSUM files also to `http://spins.fedoraproject.org` in
  `static/checksums`. Verify the paths are correct in
  `data/content/verify.html`. (see point e) to query them on
  sundries01). Same for labs.fpo and arm.fpo.

- Verify all paths and links on <http://spins.fpo>, labs.fpo and
  arm.fpo.

- Update Alpha Image sizes and pre_cloud_composedate in
  `./build.d/globalvar.py`. Verify they are right in Cloud images and
  Docker image.

- Update the new POT files and push them to translation repository every
  time you change text strings.

- Add this build to stg.fedoraproject.org (ansible syncStatic.sh.stg) to
  test the pages online.

- Release Date:

  - Merge the fXX-alpha branch to master and correct conflicts manually

  - Remove the redirect of prerelease pages in ansible, edit:
    `ansible/playbooks/include/proxies-redirects.yml`. Ask a
    sysadmin-main to run the playbook.

  - When ready and about 90 minutes before Release Time, push to master

  - Tag the commit as new release and push it too:

        $ git tag -a FXX-Alpha -m 'Releasing Fedora XX Alpha'
        $ git push --tags

  - If needed follow [Fire in the Hole](#fire-in-the-hole)

### Update website for GA {#_update_website_for_ga}

- Create the fXX branch from master

      fedora-web git:(master) git push origin master:refs/heads/f23

  and checkout to the new branch:

      fedora-web git:(master) git checkout -t -b f23 origin/f23

- Update the global variables changing `curr_state` to \'\' for all
  architectures.

- Check all Download links and paths in `${PRODUCT}/download/index.html`
  You can find all paths in bapp01 (sudo su - mirrormanager first) or
  you can look at the downlaod page
  `http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage`

- Add CHECKSUM files to `static/checksums` and verify that the paths are
  correct. The files should be in sundries01 and you can query them
  with:

      *CHECKSUM* -exec cp '{}' . \;

  Remember to add the right checksums to the right websites (same path).

- At some point freeze translations. Add an empty PO_FREEZE file to
  every website's directory you want to freeze.

- Add EC2 AMI IDs for GA. All IDs now are in the globalvar.py file. We
  get all data from there, even the redirect path to trac the AMI IDs.
  We now also have a script which is useful to get all the AMI IDs
  uploaded with fedimg. Execute it to get the latest uploads, but don't
  run the script too early, as new builds are added constantly.

      fedora-web git:(fXX) python ~/fedora-web/tools/get_ami.py

- Add CHECKSUM files also to `http://spins.fedoraproject.org` in
  `static/checksums`. Verify the paths are correct in
  `data/content/verify.html`. (see point e) to query them on
  sundries01). Same for labs.fpo and arm.fpo.

- Remove static/checksums/Fedora-XX-Beta\* in all websites.

- Verify all paths and links on <http://spins.fpo>, labs.fpo and
  arm.fpo.

- Update GA Image sizes and pre_cloud_composedate in
  `./build.d/globalvar.py`. Verify they are right in Cloud images and
  Docker image.

- Update static/js/checksum.js and check if the paths and checksum still
  match.

- Update the new POT files and push them to translation repository every
  time you change text strings.

- Add this build to stg.fedoraproject.org (ansible syncStatic.sh.stg) to
  test the pages online.

- Release Date:

  - Merge the fXX branch to master and correct conflicts manually

  - Add the redirect of prerelease pages in ansible, edit
    `ansible/playbooks/include/proxies-redirects.yml`.

  - Ask a sysadmin-main to run playbook

  - Unfreeze translations by deleting the PO_FREEZE files

  - When ready and about 90 minutes before Release Time, push to master

  - Update the short links for the Cloud Images for \'Fedora XX\',
    \'Fedora XX-1\' and \'Latest\'

  - Tag the commit as new release and push it too:

        $ git tag -a FXX -m 'Releasing Fedora XX'
        $ git push --tags

  - If needed follow [Fire in the Hole](#fire-in-the-hole)

### Fire in the hole {#_fire_in_the_hole}

We now use ansible for everything, and normally use a regular build to
make the websites live. If something is not happening as expected, you
should get in contact with a sysadmin-main to run the ansible playbook
again.

All our puppet stuff, such as SyncStatic.sh and SyncTranslation.sh
scripts are now also in ansible!

Staging server app02 and production server bapp01 do not exist anymore,
now our staging websites are on sundries01.stg and the production on
sundries01. Change your scripts accordingly and as sysadmin-web you
should have access to those servers as before.

### Tips {#_tips}

- Merging branches

  This can be useful if you're *sure* all new changes on devel branch
  should go into the master branch. Conflicts will be solved directly
  accepting only the changes in the devel branch. If you're not 100%
  sure do a normal merge and fix conflicts manually!

      $ git merge f23-beta
      $ git checkout --theirs f23-beta [list of conflicting po files]
      $ git commit

# Fedora Release (Modern) {#_fedora_release_modern}

## Introduction {#_introduction}

:::: note
::: title
:::

This assume you have a working setup already. See the [fedoraproject.org
repository](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/README.md)
for instructions.
::::

This document guides you through updating the websites for a release
(beta or GA) of Fedora.

:::: note
::: title
:::

Make sure your changes are made on the `develop` branch. Staging & prod
environment can then be updated with standard Merge Request.
::::

## Releases information {#_releases_information}

First, you need to edit the
[release.yml](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/content/release.yml)
file either directly from git, or using the
[CMS](https://fedora.gitlab.io/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/admin/#/collections/release/entries/releaseData)
(recommended). If you are updating for a **beta** release, then make
sure to flip the \"Display Beta Download\" toggle in the CMS, or set the
`beta.enabled` flag in the `release.yml` file to `true`.

This toggles whether we show the beta download links at all.

Bump the release version and set the release candidate version to the RC
that was called gold/ready for release. Find this information out from
releng, if necessary.

For GA release, you'll need to update the Release Date and the Fedora
Magazine announcement post as well.

## Cloud AMI list {#_cloud_ami_list}

You'll need to update the Fedora Cloud AMI list using [the
`fetch_amis.py`
script](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/.build/fetch_amis.py):

``` bash
./fetch_amis.py ../content/release.yml ../content/editions/cloud/ami_list.yml
```

The AMI list will be updated in `/content/editions/cloud/ami_list.yml`
by using the information from the `release.yml` file edited in the
previous step. Add that file to your commit.

## Fedora Media Writer {#_fedora_media_writer}

The next step is to produce the `releases.json` static file used by
Fedora Media Writer to produce its list of possible downloads.

Use the [the `build_fmw_release.py`
script](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/.build/build_fmw_release.py)
to generate that JSON file with the release information from the
`release.yml` file:

``` bash
./build_fmw_release.py ../content/release.yml > ../public/releases.json
```

Check that the `releases.json` file looks sane and contains the newest
release. Add that file to your commit.

## GPG Keys {#_gpg_keys}

Lastly, you'll want to add the latest GPG key information to `gpg_keys`
in
[`security.yml`](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/content/security.yml)
or with the
[CMS](https://fedora.gitlab.io/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/admin/#/collections/release/entries/securityData).
Follow the pattern that is already there, and move any now-EOL releases
into the `obsolete` subsection.

## Release day {#_release_day}

On release day (or the day before), you can check that all download
links are good with the [check_link.py
script](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/-/blob/develop/.build/check_link.py).
This uses the release information from the `release.yaml` file.

``` bash
./check_link.py

Checking download artifacts...

Cloud:
[OK] https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/38/Cloud/aarch64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-38-1.6.aarch64.qcow2
[OK] https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/38/Cloud/aarch64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-38-1.6.aarch64.raw.xz
[...]
***********************
All Good!
```

If any artifact is flagged as missing, contact releng/infra team.

## Conclusion {#_conclusion}

That should be all. The old sites (namely spins, labs, alt, arm) which
haven't been ported to the new system need to be updated separately and
are beyond the scope of this document.

Commit your changes on the `develop` branch, make sure everything looks
good on the GitLab pages, then use Merge Request to deploy to staging &
prod.

# Set up your environment (old way) {#_set_up_your_environment_old_way}

:::: note
::: title
:::

We now have documentation on using the `Dockerfile` which ships in the
Fedora websites repository. We and trying that method before using the
method outlined on this page. See [this tutorial](setup-modern.xml).
::::

## Preliminary Notes {#_preliminary_notes}

There are some open tickets
([31](https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites/issue/31),
[11](https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites/issue/11)) about getting the
websites repository building on Fedora with Python 3.

However, it should be able to be built on Fedora 30, using Python 2
packages, for now.

### Fedora 29 Alternative {#_fedora_29_alternative}

Note, the dependencies below may not currently resolve due to package
renaming in Fedora 30. If the dependencies do not resolve in Fedora 30,
running Flask from a Fedora 29 container is an alternative. An example
to run the Fedora 29 container using `podman` is as follows:

``` bash
# Expose the default port for Flask, 5000.
podman run --expose 5000 --net=host --privileged -v /path/to/websites/repo:/path/to/websites/repo -ti registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:29
```

## Dependencies {#_dependencies}

That said, assuming Fedora 30, install the following dependencies. Note
this list comes directly from the Fedora Infrastructure OpenShift build
for Websites found
[here](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/openshift-apps/websites/templates/buildconfig.yml):

``` bash
dnf install \
git \
python-flask \
python-frozen-flask \
python-flask-assets \
python-rjsmin \
python-cssmin \
python-flask-babel \
python-flask-htmlmin \
python-cssutils \
rubygem-sass \
babel \
python3-jinja2 \
python-pyyaml \
python-dateutil \
python-dogpile-cache \
python-requests \
python-zanata-client
```

## Pull Strings {#_pull_strings}

Now we need to pull the current translations. After installing the
dependencies above, you can `cd` into `sites/getfedora.org/` and run:
`./scripts/pull-translations.sh`.

Once the dependencies are installed and translations are pulled, you can
do one of two things:

## Use the Development Server {#_use_the_development_server}

One option is to use the Flask built-in development server. This is
handy because it prevents you from needing to build the websites every
time you change something. However, it bypasses the Frozen-Flask system
which creates are static sites, entirely, so it's not entirely an
accurate representation of what goes live.

To use the development server:

``` bash
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run --reload
```

Now you many visit <http://localhost:5000/> to get to the site.

## Use Apache {#_use_apache}

Alternatively, you may simply run `python main.py`. You'll get a
statically built site in the `./build/` directory. However, the HTML
files are all language-code-suffixed as Apache/httpd MultiViews system
expects (e.g. `index.html.en`). As a result you **cannot** just run a
simple HTTP server (like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) in the `./build/`
directory, unfortunately.

You can, however, set up an Apache on your system, and point it to the
`./build/` directory.

:::: note
::: title
:::

We should probably add an example Apache config here at some point.
::::

# Set up your environment (using containers) {#_set_up_your_environment_using_containers}

## Preliminary Notes {#_preliminary_notes_2}

It is now easier to get started on developing the Fedora Websites with
the use of Docker (or Podman).

We ship a `Dockerfile` which will install dependencies into an image for
you, so all you are left to do is mount the site as a volume, pull
translations, and start the development server.

:::: note
::: title
:::

The documentation here refers to `docker`, but our fairly simple use of
it means that things are likely to work with `podman` with little
modification.
::::

## Building the container image {#_building_the_container_image}

First clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites.git
```

(You may instead clone your fork of it, or add your fork as a second
remote later on.)

Now ensure Docker is running and run:

``` bash
sudo docker build -t fedora-websites .
```

This will generate a container image for you to use.

## Pulling translations {#_pulling_translations}

We have a script for pulling translations. Let's call it from within the
container:

``` bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" fedora-websites ./scripts/pull-translations.sh
```

Notice here that we are mounting a volume (`-v`) in Docker which points
to our check-out of the repository. We're referring to the
`fedora-websites` image created above, and calling the
`./scripts/pull-translations.sh` script from within it.

## Running the development server {#_running_the_development_server}

Now we are ready to run the development server:

``` bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" -p 5000:5000 fedora-websites flask run --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

Note that we need `-p 5000:5000` so that we can access the development
server from our actual host. Also notice that we need to tell Flask to
listen on `0.0.0.0` as by default it listens on `127.0.0.1` which won't
be accessible outside of the container.

You may now go to `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser of choice.

Now you are ready to go and any changes you make in the repository
should be reflected immediately upon refreshing the page in your
browser.

# Creating New Content {#_creating_new_content}

Content can be broken into several different components, although some
of the process is the same for all cases.

All new sites are being built with the Python
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework and the
[Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) library for
generating static pages.

## New Editions {#_new_editions}

New editions of Fedora should be added to the getfedora.org website. We
are trying to get away from having a bunch of `*.fedoraproject.org`
sites for each of the various editions (currently we have
<https://coreos.fedoraproject.org>, <https://iot.fedoraproject.org>,
etc.).

## New Websites {#_new_websites}

There are cases, however, where the content being added is **not** a new
edition, and is deserving of having its own distinct website, separate
from getfedora.org. These cases should probably be somewhat rare.

# New Edition {#_new_edition}

## Introduction {#_introduction_2}

Fedora editions are \"versions\" of Fedora that users can install. These
include \"official\" editions (Workstation and Server at time of
writing), but the ultimate goal in Websites is to also make Spins and
Labs editions be considered \"editions\" in some form as far as websites
are concerned. That is to say, we'd like to ultimately have Spins and
Labs have a section on the main getfedora.org site, rendering
<https://spins.fedorparoject.org/> and <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/>
useless and able to be gotten rid of. Doing this effectively will take
some time.

Also note that most of the content in this document applies to adding
pages in general, with the notable exception of the `release.yaml`
edits. Adding a page to getfedora.org should follow largely the same
process, though.

:::: note
::: title
:::

All new editions should be added to getfedora.org, to aid in our goal of
getting rid of all of the `*.fedoraproject.org` edition-specific
subdomain sites. This generates a more consistent and less confusing
user experience and makes maintenance of the websites easier going
forward. Everything in this document assumes that you are working with
the getfedora.org codebase, and NOT creating a new site from scratch.
::::

Now then, all work in this document takes place in the repository in
which [getfedora.org](https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites/) lives, and
particularly in the `sites/getfedora.org/` directory.

## Edition-specific Release Variables {#_edition_specific_release_variables}

The first step is to edit `release.yaml`, and add the relevant sections
under `ga` and `beta` for your new edition. Use `workstation` and
`server` as templates. You might not need all variables that these
existing sections have, or you might need to add new ones, depending on
your templates, but these blocks should get you started.

## Exporting the Edition Routes {#_exporting_the_edition_routes}

Now, open `main.py` and go to near the bottom, where you'll note a
number of `export_route(…​)` calls. This method is a custom method
defined earlier in the file, which does a little bit of work for us: The
first argument is an internal identifier name, so that we can reference
the page using `url_for` safely (if the URL changes, so will the URLs
that get generated by `url_for`). The second argument is a path to the
directory that contains the templates you'll make, but with a preceding
and trailing `/`. Follow the example of the other, currently existing
pages and add the appropriate `export_route` calls at the end.

## Hacking the Templates {#_hacking_the_templates}

The templates themselves live in the `sites` directory (under
`sites/getfedora.org/` still). There are already templates started (but
not currently exported in `main.py`) for `silverblue`, `coreos`, and
`iot`, at time of writing.

:::: important
::: title
:::

Every string you add **must** be enclosed in `{% trans %}` ...​
`{% endtrans %}` blocks so that it can be translated. If the string
spans multiple lines (we tend to break at 80 characters but are fairly
lenient about this), then the opening block should instead be
`{% trans trimmed %}` (the closing block is still just
`{% endtrans %}`).
::::

You can copy the templates from the existing editions, if you need
inspiration or help.

## Letting the Translators Do Their Thing {#_letting_the_translators_do_their_thing}

Once the above is done, the next step is get all the strings in the
hands of the Fedora Translations team. If you have an account on
Fedora's Zanata instance, and are in the appropriate websites group on
Zanata, and have a valid `~/.config/zanata.ini` file, you can do this
step yourself. Otherwise you'll either need to be added to the
appropriate team or have someone do this for you:

Run `./scripts/translations-source.sh`. At the end of its output, it
will give you the Zanata command to push the strings up:
`zanata push getfedora.org.pot`

## Concluding {#_concluding}

Largely, that is it. You've added variables that are easy to update each
release (in `release.yaml`), you've exported the pages, written your
templates in a translatable way, and pushed those strings to the
Translations team. Now you can sit back and relax while the translators
do their thing. Their translations will go live immediately (well,
within an hour) and automatically.

# Creating A New Site {#_creating_a_new_site}

In rare cases, you might need to create an entirely new site, rather
than an edition or page on getfedora.org.

In a future world, this document will help you do so.

For this to happen effectively, we'll need to abstract some things out
from the current getfedora.org work.

But familiarizing yourself with
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and
[Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) is a good
starting point, as we plan for all of our websites to build using this
toolset.

# Translation flow (for Fedora websites) {#_translation_flow_for_fedora_websites}

## General {#_general}

Fedora websites can be viewed in many languages. This page gives some
details on how this happens.

### Tagging text {#_tagging_text}

System needs to be told what strings needs to be translated. Generally
every text inside web page should be surrounded with tags:

``` html
{% trans trimmed %}Translate this text.{% endtrans %}
```

## Generating pot file {#_generating_pot_file}

First we need to pull all translatable strings into a file called
getfedora.org.pot

This file is generated by running:

``` bash
podman run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" fedora-websites ./scripts/translations-source.sh
```

This file needs to be sent to [translations
repository](https://pagure.io/fedora-web/translations)

If you don't have access to the translations repository push it to
fedora-websites and create a pull request and once approved it should be
automatically sent to translations repository with 24 hours.

## Weblate process (How strings get translated) {#_weblate_process_how_strings_get_translated}

Once getfedora.org.pot file is in the translations repository it will be
pulled by Weblate system and merged into translatable strings. It can
then be translated by translators.

## Manual testing {#_manual_testing}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Any translations made here will not get propagated to the weblate of
final versions of the page.
::::

You can test the changes manually by:

1\) Update strings to the language files

``` bash
podman run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" fedora-websites ./scripts/translations-update-local.sh
```

Now edit desired language file, for example

``` bash
nano sites/getfedora.org/translations/fi/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
```

Find the string you want to test, format inside file is:

`#: partials/templates/download_card.html:13` Location(s) of string.
`msgid "Download"` Text in english. `msgstr "Lataa"` Text in desired
language.

Edit the `msgstr`

Once edited translations need to be compiled into more efficient format
for the web server. This is done by running:

``` bash
podman run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" fedora-websites ./scripts/translations-compile-local.sh
```

You can now change your browser setting to desired language and see how
the translations are working out.

### Description of translation scripts inside sites/getfedora.org/scripts {#_description_of_translation_scripts_inside_sitesgetfedora_orgscripts}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Technically scripts can be run without using podman, but will then
require proper setup in the local machine. The instructions given above
are safer for generic users.

# Fedora Websites & Apps Team {#_fedora_websites_apps_team}

Welcome to the official documentation for the Fedora Websites & Apps
Team. The team was rebooted in 2021 as a part of the [Websites & Apps
Community Revamp
Objective](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives/Websites_%26_Apps_Community_Revamp).
With the onset of this council objective, the team has been growing ever
since with developers, designers and project managers having a wide
range of skills and interests all members of the team and contributing
to the Fedora Websites and Apps. It now organizes around [Websites
Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0)
and [Matrix Websites
chat](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#websites:fedoraproject.org).

## About the team {#about}

Our websites are of top priority and importance, being our web-based
representation to the wider community of users and contributors. The
team works on designing, developing and maintaining user-friendly
interfaces. The community-led team consists of voluntary contributors
from around the world that are involved in activities such as the
following:

- Consolidate key Fedora Project websites into a single uniform scheme:
  in terms of design (look/feel and UI/UX), engineering (tech stack and
  implementation) and operation (navigation and content), the team
  attempts to maintain the websites as consistently as possible.

- Develop frontend and backend components of Fedora's web applications:
  with the use of frontend tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the related
  frameworks) and backend tools (Python, Ansible, JavaScript and the
  related frameworks), the team develops and maintains the web
  applications.

- Making websites as fun and exciting as the project they represent: a
  book might not be judged by its cover but a project is likely to be
  judged by the website it is represented by. The team ensures that the
  websites precisely represent the project's details and offerings.

- Help maintain content that doesn't fall under any particular
  subproject: much of the content that the team maintains is generic in
  nature, like documentation, community wiki, event banners which do not
  fit in a certain subteam or SIG.

## Related teams

In addition to the Websites and Apps Team, we have two other teams we're
working closely with. These teams have a specific objective and once
that objective has been met, the teams will disband and their work
adopted by the main Websites and Apps Team.

### Fedora Websites Revamp Stakeholders Team {#_fedora_websites_revamp_stakeholders_team}

The subteam consists of folks from the design team and various other
subprojects, SIGs and workgroups where they come up with mockups for the
offerings websites, review them and improve upon them continually.

### Fedora Websites Engineering Team {#_fedora_websites_engineering_team}

The subteam looks into the technical side of things - helping with
developing and maintaining the websites in the state that they are in
for now, assisting with the issue tickets and onboarding/mentoring
contributors.

### Fedora Websites and Apps Objective Co-leads Team {#_fedora_websites_and_apps_objective_co_leads_team}

This team looks into the cohesion of the websites and apps community -
introspecting the current state of the teams, attempting to attract new
contributors and ensuring existing contributors feel rewarded and that
the objective outcomes are met. More information is available on the
next page, see our [Council
Objective](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/websites/objective/)
page.

## Our collaborators {#collaborators}

In order to work in a community with as many diverse projects and
stakeholders as the Fedora Project, the team aims to communicate and
collaborate regularly with different community members from various
subprojects, SIGs and workgroups within Fedora. The activities on
specific websites and applications are coordinated by the relevant
points of contact.

## Mission {#_mission}

To reboot the websites team to include webapps in the scope of work and
set up the team so that they can grow capacity in the future to build

# Our tasks {#_our_tasks}

The team designs, develops and maintains the Fedora's websites and
applications.

These involve a variety of tasks suitable for both newcomers and
experienced contributors.

## Something for everyone {#division}

Web technologies, being a very widespread technological stack and an
avid point of interest for those involved in marketing, product design,
project management etc., the team is in constant need of community
contributors who are willing to work on these.

### Are you a newcomer to web development? {#_are_you_a_newcomer_to_web_development}

It is highly recommended for newcomers to web development to join us in
our periodic meetings and introduce themselves to start with. According
to the level of experience, the team members would help curate issue
tickets suitable for them and provide mentorship/guidance wherever
necessary in technological stacks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.
This documentation should also consist enough information to help them
get started with contributing.

### Are you an experienced in web development? {#_are_you_an_experienced_in_web_development}

The team often has an array of tickets that demand more advanced
knowledge and experience in our technological stack and management
operations, and they could always use all the help that we can get. They
are always interested to work with developers that bring something new
to the table and actively assist in maintaining the status quo of the
team. The contributors are requested to participate in the periodic
meetings and reach out to the team.

## Example tasks {#tasks}

### Adding temporary content to websites {#_adding_temporary_content_to_websites}

Temporary elements such as beta release indicators on the Fedora Linux
offering websites, and banners for surveys and events are to be placed
periodically.

### Developing approved design mockups {#_developing_approved_design_mockups}

After the design mockups have gone through a review process and ready
for implementation, they need to be developed into a final interactive
project.

### Participating in the periodic meetings {#_participating_in_the_periodic_meetings}

The team connects periodically on a meeting to discuss updates, blockers
and plans on activities, either synchronously on call or asynchronously
on chat.

### Updating server-side code {#_updating_server_side_code}

Websites and applications need to be hosted on a relevant environment
(development. staging or deployment), depending on the phase and
maturity of the project.

### Improving language and accessibility support {#_improving_language_and_accessibility_support}

This involves working alongside the localization teams for translating
the available content to various languages and provide accessibility
options.

### Revamping websites to improve user experience {#_revamping_websites_to_improve_user_experience}

In order to keep up with the current internet standards, older websites
need to be rebooted using newer design methodologies and tech stacks.

### Writing documentation for contributors {#_writing_documentation_for_contributors}

Establishing processes and ensuring reproducibility of the activities is
better supported by documentation to guide contributors through them.

### Creating issue tickets and triaging them {#_creating_issue_tickets_and_triaging_them}

To note the tasks involved in making the aforementioned activities
happen and to prioritize them, the team uses certain issue trackers and
task boards.

## Report a bug {#bug}

Did you find a bug on one of our websites?

Please see these [instructions on fixing
bugs](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_fix_bugs_on_the_Fedora_Project_website).

Otherwise, please report them on our
[repository](https://pagure.io/fedora-websites).

# Representatives {#_representatives}

The responsibilities of the representative involves representing the
team to the Mindshare committee and collaborate with other
groups/teams/SIGs that work with them. Being a conduit between the two
teams, the representative is expected to invest a fair amount of time
and have good communication skills.

## Representatives {#_representatives_2}

### Current representative {#_current_representative}

- [Onuralp Sezer](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Thunderbirdtr)

### Previous representatives {#_previous_representatives}

- [Rick Elrod](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Codeblock)

## Responsibilities {#_responsibilities}

Representatives are critical in keeping communication between the team
and Mindshare flowing. As a Mindshare representative, you will be
involved in the following activities:

- Participate in the fedora-mindshare IRC/Matrix channel's weekly
  meetups

- In the fedora-mindshare Pagure repo, review and comment on tickets

- Work closely with the representatives from the other outreach teams to
  ensure that the most effective decisions are made

- Give the Mindshare Committee valuable input

- Share best practises: one of Mindshare's objectives is to remove any
  hurdles or impediments to sharing best practises

- Ascertain that the team is represented, and bring any challenges or
  barriers they may encounter to Mindshare meetings

- Ascertain that the Fedora budget is managed efficiently across all
  locations

- Listen to the Fedora community's needs, problems, and hopes and
  transmit them to the Mindshare Committee

## Duration of service {#_duration_of_service}

The service will last for two Fedora release cycles, or a year. However,
depending on the personal circumstances of those serving as
Representatives, terms may be shorter or longer. In the odd case that
the representative(s), Mindshare Committee, or the Websites and Apps
Team choose to change representation, they must show appropriate
justification. The Websites and Apps Team will then choose a new
representative based on the SOP.

## Selection {#_selection}

This section outlines the process of nominating and selecting
representatives. The selection procedure outlined below begins when a
current representative, the Mindshare committee, or the Fedora Council
requests a rotation of representatives.

### Nomination {#_nomination}

Potential delegates will have a two-week period to nominate themselves.
Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated with the approval of other
members of the Websites and Apps Team. Nominees must be members of the
said team, have a basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects,
and have enough time to complete the essential obligations.

If no nominees are found, the Websites and Apps Team will collaborate
with the Mindshare Committee to extend the search message and request
more time. If no nominees are discovered after that, the role will be
rotated among current Websites and Apps Team members until a new
representative is found.

## Teams you will be closely working with {#_teams_you_will_be_closely_working_with}

- Fedora Mindshare

- Websites and Apps Team and Subteams

- Various other Outreach teams as required

# Resources {#_resources_2}

The Websites & Apps Team is made up of people who collaborate on all
levels of design, operations and technology. They value perspectives,
opinions and experiences from a various points of views. Please check
out these resources for your own local setup.

We are continually working to expand our established processes,
instructional materials and documentation.

# Fedora Websites Revamp Stakeholders Team {#_fedora_websites_revamp_stakeholders_team_2}

Welcome to the official documentation for the Fedora Websites Revamp
Stakeholders Team.

## Points of contact {#_points_of_contact_2}

- [Pawel
  Zelawski](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/pawelzelawski/)

- [Timothee Ravier](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Siosm)

## Purpose {#_purpose_2}

The team looks into designing aesthetics, making the style guide,
planning the website strategy and deciding the tech stack for delivering
Fedora Linux offerings website.

## Function {#_function_2}

1.  Multiple contributors from Design team, Server WG, Workstation WG,
    Kinoite subteam, Fedora Infra subteam, NeuroFedora SIG etc. have
    been participating in discussions over at the chatroom.

2.  Members from the design team have been continually instrumental in
    coming up with various mockups and improving upon them by getting
    reviews from within the team and the outer community (Discussion
    fp.o)

3.  Design team representative, Mairin Duffy had been mentoring a set of
    interns, Emma Kidney and Jess Chitas as well with her endeavours of
    creating mockups for the Fedora Linux websites.

4.  Planning and updates are now recorded in a GitLab subgroup - the
    creation of which was pursued by the members of this team,
    contributors from Fedora Infra and those from the Community Platform
    Engineering team.

5.  Meetings have been organized by Pawel Zelawski and attended by the
    members periodically to catch up on the progress, perform
    stakeholders reviews and plan on the next tasks.

6.  With active representation in the events like Nest With Fedora and
    Fedora Linux Release Parties, the team had been reaching out to
    garner more feedback on the work done so far and acquire
    contributors for assistance.

# Meetings {#_meetings_2}

The team members collaborate periodically over synchronous and
asynchronous meetings.

## Video conference meetings {#_video_conference_meetings}

The Websites Revamp Stakeholders Team meets weekly as long as there are
at least four active participants available. Should that not be the
case - updates, plans and blockers are conveyed asynchronously in the
Fedora Chat channel by the members.

## Agenda {#_agenda}

A video conference meeting is a fleeting affair and hence, it is
important to use every moment of the meeting wisely to discuss important
topics.

### Example {#_example_2}

The following is a Markdown-styled example agenda to extend from.

    ## FORMAT

    ### Chair
    - ADD YOUR NAME(S) HERE

    ### Attendees
    - ADD YOUR NAME(S) HERE

    ### Check up
    - How are you doing?
    - How's the weather there?

    ### Agenda
    - ADD ITEMS HERE

## How to chair team meetings? {#_how_to_chair_team_meetings_2}

Anyone can be a chair for the Websites Revamp Stakeholders Team, and we
encourage everyone to try chairing our weekly team meetings at least
once to get an experience. The team is supportive of newcomers and
experienced folks alike who are trying to chair a meeting for the first
time so one need not worry about anything going wrong midway.

The chair should

- Be one of the first ones to join the meeting as they would be the one
  coordinating with the attendees and carrying the meeting forward

- Have the agenda document open on a side to read topics from, add names
  to the roster and make notes/summaries/action-items discussed on

- Make sure that all the points from the slated agenda are discussed
  during the meeting and that the action items, if any, are accounted
  for

- Ensure that the attendees feel comfortable enough and get a fair
  amount of time to put their points forward and that their points are
  considered

- Act as an arbiter to settle disputes, if there are any, among the
  attendees and try to reach middle ground and avoid conflicts.

- Keep track of \"raised hands\" in order to ensure that every attendee
  in the meeting gets their opportunity to speak in the order of \"hands
  raised\"

- Let the team know well in advance if they are not able to make it to
  the meeting that they volunteered to chair for to help get a
  replacement

- Attempt to prevent diversions in the meeting, be they caused by either
  themselves or the attendees and try to maximally utilize the meeting
  time

- Motivate communication in an accessible manner - so folks who are
  unwilling to use camera and/or microphone should be encouraged to use
  the chat

- Conduct an in-meeting poll, discussion, opinions, debate in an
  unbiased and fair manner to all the attendees to avoid any possible
  conflicts

- Feel comfortable to pass on their turn to someone else mid-meeting,
  should something important come up or if they cannot attend anymore

- Avoid a survivorship bias by passing on the updates shared and
  progresses made on the meeting to the wider community using relevant
  channels

- Make notes on the developments made in a meeting, summarize
  discussions, plans and action items, or find an assignee from the
  attendees to do it

- Ensure that they are attending the meeting from a noise-free and
  disturbance-free environment and are not distracted by any other work
  or social media

- Use an accessible and simple vocabulary to convey their statements for
  maximum participation, and wait enough after each point for attendees
  to reflect

## Participation guidelines {#_participation_guidelines}

- Please focus on listening, and on appreciating what others are trying
  to say, not only on what you are hearing.

- Wherever possible, please refrain from multitasking on email or social
  media and strive to remain fully present and tuned in to what others
  are saying and feeling.

- Please assume best intent in everyone's comments and strive to keep a
  constructive tone in your own.

- Please use simple, accessible language. In particular, please avoid
  jargon and acronyms, so that all may fully participate.

- When you speak, please make just one point and then let others speak.
  We want everyone to have an equal chance to speak. In a group of \"n\"
  people, speak no more than \"1/nth\" of the time.

- Please speak for yourself when making comments, using \"I\". Please
  don't speak for the assembled group by speaking as \"we\".

- Help us be mindful of the schedule and stay on time; we anticipate
  many people will have much they want to say, but please support us in
  moving the dialog forward.

## Please be a self-aware participant! {#_please_be_a_self_aware_participant}

- Please indicate you want to speak by raising your hand on video or
  with the button in Jitsi Meet; if you are not able to use or raise
  your hand, feel free to speak up but please try not to interrupt
  others.

- Please stay muted when you are not speaking.

- Please be mindful of background noise and join the call from a quiet
  location. Construction sites, windy gardens and non-quarantined
  internet cafes do not qualify as quiet locations.

- All parents and caregivers shall enjoy an irrevocable
  \"background/foreground kid and dependent noise\" exception at all
  times, but muting etiquette still applies.
