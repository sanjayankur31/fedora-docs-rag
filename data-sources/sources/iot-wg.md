The Fedora IoT Working Group develops and maintains the [Fedora IoT
Edition](iot::index.xml). If you'd like to join us, introduce yourself
and pitch in!

# Communications {#_communications}

We primarily communicate by the [Fedora IoT mailing
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/)
and the [&#35;fedora-iot IRC channel on
Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=&#35;fedora-iot) (bridged
to [&#35;iot on
chat.fedoraproject.org](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;iot:fedoraproject.org)).
Check the [IoT calendar](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/IoT/) for
meeting times and locations.

# Contributing to Fedora IoT {#_contributing_to_fedora_iot}

There's a number of components that make up Fedora IoT. The upstream
source components for general projects like the Zezere and Greenboot
reside on the [Fedora IoT GitHub page](https://github.com/fedora-iot/).

For the source for Fedora specific things like compose configs, we have
the [Fedora IoT](https://pagure.io/group/fedora-iot) Pagure organisation
which contains the various git repositories for building Fedora IoT.

Docs and upstream component sources are on
[GitHub](https://github.com/fedora-iot).

Bugs are tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla using the [IoT tracker
bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=IoT) for bugs reported
against other components and the [IoT
component](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?component=IoT&amp;product=Fedora)
for IoT-specific issues.

&#42; Historical docs == Requirements to promote Fedora IoT to an
official edition

This is based on the [Edition promotion
process](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Editions/Promotion_Process)
pending approval from the Fedora Council. Historical information is
included below for reference, although it is now incredibly out of date.

# Historical content {#_historical_content}

## Phase one: MVP Edition launch (timeframe: July. Before Flock.) {#_phase_one_mvp_edition_launch_timeframe_july_before_flock}

&#42; Items for IoT team to complete &#42;&#42; F-30 published on stable
ostree repo &#42;&#42;&#42; Currently on "devel" branch --- need F30 to
be the stable one instead of F29 &#42;&#42;&#42; This is something Peter
can do, but for F31 this should be integrated into proper QA &amp;
Rel-Eng process. Need procedures and to define clear roles. &#42;&#42;
Clean up release process &#42;&#42; New ostrees and new ISOs &#42;&#42;
Equivalent of two-week Atomic release process, but monthly &#42;&#42;
Initial basic docs for release process &#42;&#42;&#42; So that not
everything is just in Peter's head &#42;&#42; Update release criterial
documentation &#42;&#42; Automatic updates enabled for F-30 release
images &#42;&#42;&#42; This is a change to ostree configuration to match
CoreOS &#42;&#42; Update fedora-release-iot defaults and settings, add
greenboot &#42;&#42;&#42; PR from IoT team &#42;&#42;&#42; Package owned
by release engineering so CPE team expected to review and integrate PR
&#42;&#42;&#42; Review move to standard Fedora keys if ostree key
rollover works &#42;&#42; Review of outstanding tickets for
features/fixes

&#42; Web site(s) updates &#42;&#42; New content for the IoT page
&#42;&#42;&#42; Content from IoT team &#42;&#42;&#42; Design from ???
(will ask OSPO) &#42;&#42;&#42; Integration work into new web system
from CPE &#42;&#42;&#42; Parity with existing iot.fedoraproject.org for
automatic updates when new images come out with &#42;&#42; New content
for front page presenting the edition &#42;&#42;&#42; Any text from CPE
team &#42;&#42;&#42; Design to match existing front page &#42;&#42;&#42;
Update to front page from ??? &#42;&#42; Redirect from
iot.fedoraproject.org to new getfedora edition page

## Phase two: Ideal target, Fedora 31 GA (October) {#_phase_two_ideal_target_fedora_31_ga_october}

&#42; ARMv7 supported images (actually aiming this for phase 1) &#42;
Container pipeline for supported architectures &#42;&#42;&#42; x86_64,
ARMv7, aarch64 &#42;&#42;&#42; Current state: just x86_64, so we need
ARM &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Donated aarch64 hardware exists but is being
used as koji builders &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Note hardware was donated for
this purpose

&#42;&#42; Possible future: i686 &#42;&#42; This is the big request for
CPE &#42; IoT Toolbox container &#42;&#42; X86_64, ARMv7, aarch64
&#42;&#42; This is an IoT team thing &#42; A number of containers for
IoT demo use cases &#42;&#42; X86_64, ARMv7, aarch64 &#42;&#42; Also
handed by IoT team &#42; Publish "devel" image with toolbox container,
and "production" image without toolbox &#42;&#42; This is a rel-eng
change, but PT from IoT team, because we're adding additional
deliverables
