The {team_name} always welcomes new contributors. Whether you are a
newcomer or an old-timer, whether you can contribute frequently or
sporadically, there are ways to get involved. As a {team_name} member,
you can:

&#42; Work closely with Fedora leadership to build initiatives from the
ground-up which shape Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion in Fedora
community. &#42; Organize global events like Fedora Week of Diversity to
support people from diverse backgrounds in taking their first steps in
Fedora community. &#42; Cross-collaborate with different teams like
Localization to enable Fedora community members from diverse backgrounds
to contribute effectively. &#42; Organize community-building workshops
and activities to foster inclusion in Fedora community. &#42; Create
outreach content like videos, infographics and blog posts to improve the
visibility of underrepresented community members in Fedora community.
&#42; Research about Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion initiatives in
other open source communities and how they can be applied to Fedora
community.

Interested in helping the {team_name}? This page explains the typical
process for getting involved with our team.

# Create Fedora Account System (FAS) account {#create-fas-account}

All contributors to Fedora need to register in the [Fedora Account
System](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/). New contributors are asked
to sign the [Fedora Project Contributor Agreement](legal::fpca.xml)
(FPCA). This is not a copyright assignment agreement, but ensures your
contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms. If you need
help with this, contact the [Fedora Infrastructure
Team](infra::day_to_day_fedora.xml).

# Discourse forum {#forum}

We have a tag on [Fedora Discussion]({team_asynch_communication}) (the
Fedora community forum) where team topics are discussed.

## Introduce yourself {#forum-introduction}

If you want to get involved, we want to get to know you! &#42;Post a
self-introduction on the [&#35;dei-team tag on Fedora
Discussion]({team_asynch_communication})&#42;. This is a helpful step
for other folks on the {team_name} to get to know you.

Not sure what to say? Consider these questions when introducing
yourself:

&#42; Are you new to the Fedora community? If so, what was interesting
to you about Fedora? &#42; Are you involved with other communities? Tell
us about what you do in other communities or projects. &#42; Do you
already contribute to Fedora? Let us know what parts of Fedora you are
involved in. &#42; Are you an organizer of local events or programs? If
you run any kind of event in your local community, let us know what you
do. &#42; What is interesting to you about the {team_name}? Our team is
a collection of people with different interests and niches. Knowing each
others\' interests and what we like lets us connect each other to things
we want to help out with.

# Join Matrix chat room {#chat}

The {team_name} has a real-time chat room on Matrix. We use the chat
room for quick updates, friendly chatter, and running meetings. Use
[this link]({team_synch_communication}) to join from your preferred
Matrix client. Don't forget to say hi when you join!

# Attend a meeting {#attend-meeting}

[&#42;&#42;Find our next meeting on our
calendar!&#42;&#42;]({team_meetings})

The {team_name} usually holds a fortnightly meeting over Jitsi Meet to
review ongoing work and plan new work. It is a good opportunity to say
hello and meet other team members in real-time while seeing how we work.
See the [team meeting guide](meetings.xml) for how our meetings work,
including the [social agreement](meetings.adoc&#35;social-agreement) and
[meeting format](meetings.adoc&#35;format).

# Ticket-based task management {#tickets}

The next step to get involved is to review our ticket tracker and look
for a task that is interesting to you. Our open tickets are in our
[GitLab repository]({team_issue_tracker}). New tasks are added as
\'issues\' into GitLab.

See a ticket that looks interesting? If someone is not already assigned,
leave a comment and ask how you can help. Another member of the team
will get back to you with feedback. This is an opportunity to get casual
mentoring on a task.

Alternatively, do you think something is missing or could be improved in
the Fedora community? Open a new ticket with your idea or suggestion.
Our best ideas come from a wide range of people with different
backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Whether you are new to the
Fedora community or are a long-time contributor, you might have the next
great idea for the team. Open a new ticket and we can discuss more about
your idea or suggestion.

# Team sponsorship {#sponsorship}

When someone is considered a full voting member of the {team_name}, we
call this person a &#42;sponsored member&#42;. After spending time
contributing with the {team_name}, you can join the team in a formal
capacity as a full voting member. The process to become sponsored is as
follows:

1.  Talk to a member(s) of the {team_name} to find a sponsor. You can
    see a list of sponsored team members in the
    [&#96;diversity-team&#96; Fedora Account System
    group](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/diversity-team/).

2.  Sponsor will open a \'New Team Member\' ticket on the {team_name}
    ticket tracker.

3.  Ticket will be open for two weeks for others members to vote and/or
    give commentary about your team membership.

    a.  If we do not reach consensus in the two-week period, it can be
        extended for another two weeks.

    b.  A negative vote halts the process and requires discussion.

4.  Full consensus is required for you to join the {team_name}. This
    means at least three +1 votes and no -1 votes.

5.  If consensus is met, you will then be added to the Fedora Account
    System (FAS) group.

Sponsors will evaluate your membership in a couple of ways:

&#42; &#42;Ability to work cooperatively with peers&#42;. &#42;&#42; By
the interactions potential members have in meetings and in channel.
&#42;&#42; By how potential members respond to criticism. &#42;&#42; By
how potential members participate on the forum, chat room, and ticket
trackers. &#42; &#42;Community involvement beyond the {team_name}&#42;.
&#42;&#42; By the interactions potential members have in the Fedora
community. &#42;&#42; Does the potential member engage on the forum,
chat room, and ticket trackers? Do they show a helpful attitude and
respect for other ideas of others? &#42; &#42;Commitment and
follow-through&#42;. &#42;&#42; By time already given to the
{team_name}. &#42;&#42; By how well potential members stick with the
process through tough issues. &#42;&#42; By how potential members engage
on difficult topics in a constructive way. &#42;&#42; By regularly
showing up in meetings or the chat rooms.

# Team meeting guide {#_team_meeting_guide}

This guide contains instructions and recommendations for running
{team_name} meetings.

## Social agreement

The social agreement is our social rules and etiquette for how we treat
each other during meetings. This keeps our meetings productive and gives
everyone an opportunity to be heard:

&#42; Focus on listening &#42; Stay present as much as possible, refrain
from email/chat/etc &#42; Let everyone have a chance to speak, be aware
of how much time you are talking &#42; Be mindful of the meeting
schedule and help to move the dialog forward &#42; Use the raise hand
function &#42; Stay on mute when you are not speaking

## Format

Since 24 October 2020, the {team_name} adopted this format for
structuring team meeting agendas:

1.  Intros, welcomes, hellos (5 minutes)

2.  Team announcements &amp; news (5-10 minutes)

3.  Follow-ups from last meeting, if any (5-10 minutes)

4.  Ticket discussions (remaining time)

5.  Open floor (final 5-10 minutes)

## How to add a ticket to meeting agenda {#add-ticket}

Add a GitLab issue to the next meeting agenda by adding them to a
&#42;milestone&#42; for the current quarter of the year. First, open a
GitLab issue and look in the metadata sidebar to the right. Then, click
*Edit* in the *Milestone* section in the sidebar. Several options should
appear in the dropdown menu that appears, e.g. *2024 Q4 Team Goals*.
Choose the milestone that corresponds to the current quarter. Once
selected, the GitLab issue will appear under the milestone. The
{team_name} uses GitLab milestones to triage discussions for our
meetings.

![Screenshot of how to update the milestone of a GitLab
issue](meetings/gitlab-update-issue-milestone.png)

## Meetbot command script {#meetbot}

Since late 2023, Fedora uses &#42;Meetbot&#42; for running text-based
meetings from our Matrix meeting rooms, e.g.
&#96;&#35;meeting:fedoraproject.org&#96; Meetbot recognizes several
commands to start a logged meeting that will generate a summary once the
meeting ends. This section includes a sample script for a
Meetbot-powered meeting on Fedora Chat.

# Decision-making process {#_decision_making_process}

This page describes how the Fedora D.E.I. team makes decisions.

## Process

Members of the [Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team FAS
group](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/diversity-team/) are
eligible to vote.

### Lazy Approval {#_lazy_approval}

This means general consent is assumed unless valid objections are raised
within a specific period of time i.e. 5 days along with minimum two
positive vote (+1) and no -1's. Votes can be cast by any approved member
of diversity team. This process is used for decisions with short-term
consequences and which can be easily reversed. Any team member can ask
for the deadline to be extended or the decision escalated to require
full consensus.

### Full Consensus {#_full_consensus}

More significant decisions are made through a process of full consensus.
In order to pass, these decisions need three positive votes (+3) and no
negative votes (-1) within a specific period of time i.e. 14 days. The
votes can be cast by any of the approved members in the FAS group for
the Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team. A negative vote immediately
halts the process and requires discussion. Therefore, in order to remain
valid, negative votes must be supported with a specific concern about
the proposal, and suggestions for what could be changed in order to make
the proposal acceptable.

## Choosing a process {#_choosing_a_process}

&#42;Lazy approval&#42; is followed for tasks with a defined process in
D.E.I. Team. When all prior steps for a task are completed with just the
ticket-based approval remaining. For example, translating an article or
proposing a Flock session fit in this model.

&#42;Full consensus&#42; is required to approve new processes, make
changes to existing team policies, and tickets requiring D.E.I. budget.
For example, proposing new event guidelines for events, changing the
decision-making process, and voting on Outreachy budget allocation
requires full consensus.

This page preserves historical content from the Fedora Diversity,
Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Team for transparency and reference. While
these initiatives are no longer active or current focus areas, their
legacy contributed to today's DEI work.

## Fedora Women

The &#42;Fedora Women&#42; initiative aimed to nurture the involvement
of women (cis and trans) and gender-queer people in Fedora and other
Free and Open Source Software projects.

This community worked to bring awareness to contributions by women and
non-binary contributors in Fedora.

Although the Fedora Women team is no longer active, many of its goals
have evolved into broader efforts, such as the [&#42;Fedora Week of
Diversity (FWD)&#42;](dei::fedora-week-of-diversity.xml).

## Demographic Survey (2015/2016) {#demographic-survey}

In 2015/2016, the Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Team
drafted a &#42;demographic survey&#42; to better understand the
composition of the Fedora community.

Due to data storage concerns, privacy issues, and evolving regulations
like GDPR, this survey was never launched.

You can check out more about it here in the Demographic survey section.

## Events

We still run active events like Fedora Week of Diversity (FWD) to
support diversity in our community, and in open source in general. You
can also look at the past events section to see what we've done before,
and follow our channels to stay updated on this year's events.

# About Fedora Project Demographic Survey {#_about_fedora_project_demographic_survey}

Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team
&lt;<diversity@lists.fedoraproject.org>&gt; :toc:

This section documents the Fedora Project Demographic Survey research.
This was work completed between 2016 to 2018 to launch a demographic
survey to understand the Fedora Community. Because of legal concerns
around recent data legislation passed in this time period
([G.D.P.R.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)),
the survey was planned but never published.

A majority of this work was completed at the [Fedora Diversity
FAD](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-diversity-fad-2017/)
in January 2017.

:::: note
::: title
:::

This page represents six to eight months of work from the Fedora
Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team in late 2015 and early 2016.
While the D.E.I. Team is &#42;no longer actively working on this
survey&#42; due to data collection and storage concerns (i.e. G.D.P.R.),
it is retained here for historical purposes. The team hopes our research
and work may be useful for other Open Source communities and Diversity,
Equity, &amp; Inclusion programmes.
::::

## Objectives

The Fedora Project Demographic Survey established these key objectives
for launching such a survey:

### 1. Understand baseline demographics about the Fedora Community. {#understand}

&#42; &#42;Why this objective was important&#42;: Enables Fedora
Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team to identify different areas of
need for contributing to Fedora, and prioritize to act on areas of
most-immediate need. &#42; &#42;Examples of target criteria&#42;:
&#42;&#42; Age &#42;&#42; Gender &#42;&#42; Race and cultural background
&#42;&#42; Geographic area or region &#42;&#42; Disability &#42;&#42;
Parents and families &#42;&#42; Non-English languages

### 2. Support underrepresented groups by supplementing on-boarding resources to other Fedora teams. {#support}

&#42; &#42;Why this objective was important&#42;: &#42;&#42; Collaborate
and support on-going work in other Fedora Teams by advising mentorship
and teaching programs in Fedora Community &#42;&#42; Disseminate best
practices through mentorship and community on-boarding &#42;
&#42;Examples of possible partnering teams&#42;: &#42;&#42; [Join
SIG](fedora-join::index.xml) &#42;&#42; Mentoring and internship
programs (GSoC and Outreachy) &#42;&#42; [Fedora
Classrooms](fedora-join::classroom/classroom.xml)

## Miscellaneous comments {#misc-comments}

When the survey was first drafted in late 2016 and early 2017, several
comments, ideas, and [resources](:resources.xml) influenced the design
of the survey and an outreach campaign for it. Some of the pending and
unresolved notes are below for archival purposes.

> &#42; How were you introduced to Fedora? .. By another Fedora
> contributor .. At a Fedora event (e.g. FAD / workshop / meetup /
> release party) .. Conference .. Hackerspace .. Red Hat .. Web / online
> &#42; What makes contributing to Fedora difficult for you?
>
> ---  Bee_Padalkar\_(bee2502)

We also wanted to identify how the data will be used. We aimed to make a
communication plan for how the data would be used. Ideally, information
about data use and intentions is available and embedded in the survey.

The following questions can be presented as a table, with the same set
of answer options. Questions about diverse perspectives, comfort with
contributing ideas, valuing best ideas, and feeling respected were
adapted from Red Hat Associate Survey.

1.  &#42;Please indicate how you feel about the following
    statements.&#42; &#42;&#42; Diverse perspectives are valued in the
    Fedora community. &#42;&#42; I feel comfortable contributing my
    ideas (in meetings or online forums), even when my views differ from
    other contributors. &#42;&#42; The people I collaborate with value
    the best ideas regardless of their source. &#42;&#42; I feel
    respected when I share my ideas and opinions in the Fedora
    community. &#42;&#42; Having greater diversity of contributors will
    positively impact the Fedora Project. &#42;&#42; I'm appreciated for
    the contributions I make.

&#42; Event Checklist = Fedora Event Guidelines

This guide is intended as a resource for organizers of conferences and
events from the Fedora community to support and encourage diversity and
inclusion at Fedora events.

It has been produced by the Fedora Diversity &amp; Inclusion team and
has been adapted from the [NumFOCUS Discover
Cookbook](http://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org).

&#42;Note&#42;: Anyone in the Fedora community can be an organizer or
help in organizing an event!

## How to use this guide {#How-to-use-this-guide}

You do not have to implement every suggestion in the guide in order to
\'qualify\' as having a diverse and inclusive event!

This guide is intended to help event organizers to understand the
&#42;landscape&#42; of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

&#42;We encourage you to do as much as you can manage&#42;. Implementing
a few well-supported suggestions is preferable to implementing many
suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

We have highlighted suggestions &#42;that are easy to implement&#42; and
which have a strong positive impact i.e. &#42;\'High Impact, Low
Effort\'&#42;. These are &#42;\'low-hanging fruits\'&#42; and marked
with a red apple emoji: 🍎.

We also encourage you to do &#42;at least one thing&#42; with
\'&#42;High Impact, High Effort&#42;\'. These are marked with a green
checkmark ✅

&#42;As a general rule, we encourage conference organizers to implement
all of the 🍎 measures and at least one of the ✅ suggestions.&#42;

# Fedora Event Inclusivity Checklist {#_fedora_event_inclusivity_checklist}

## Organizing committee

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact}

&#42; \[ \] The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity
you want to create in your conference. Consider age/career stage,
gender, race, sexual orientation, social and professional background
when assembling your committee.

## Venue

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact}

&#42; \[ \] Seats reserved for wheelchair users and other
mobility-impaired people &#42; \[ \] Wide aisles between chairs for easy
navigation &#42; \[ \] Large text signs and easy-to-read maps for people
with impaired vision &#42; \[ \] Bathrooms: signs posted on doors that
say \'Fedora supports self-identification of gender - please respect
peoples choices\' &#42; \[ \] Quiet room: dedicated room for people to
take a break (no phones, no talking)

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_2}

&#42; \[ \] Sign-language interpreters or real-time captioning in place
for people with hearing impairment &#42; \[ \] Easily accessible
gender-neutral bathrooms

## Catering

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact_2}

&#42; \[ \] Labels in front of each dish with list of ingredients and
common labels/allergens (e.g. "gluten free", "kosher", "includes
peanuts") &#42; \[ \] A variety of beverages, in particular
non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated, and sugar free

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_3}

&#42; \[ \] Plan for the following dietary needs: gluten free, dairy
free, vegan, vegetarian, pork free, shellfish free, soy free, nut free -
especially peanut (this is usually a serious allergy so take extra
care), kosher, halal.

## Code of Conduct

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact_3}

&#42; \[ \] Code of Conduct (CoC) in place (Fedora CoC) &#42; \[ \] Tick
box at registration where every participant confirms that they have read
the CoC &#42; \[ \] Copy of CoC included in sponsor packet &#42; \[ \]
CoC easily accessible on conference website &#42; \[ \] Short version
included in the printed schedule as reminder &#42; \[ \] Mentions in
welcome talks and at start of every day, including who to contact if
there is a problem

## Participant and Speaker Selection {#participant-speaker-selection}

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact_4}

&#42; \[ \] Consider specific wording of how talks were solicited so as
not to put people with diverse backgrounds off (e.g. call for "speakers
who have advice or expertise to share" rather than "experts in best
practices) &#42; \[ \] Call for Proposals: Are you transparent that you
want a broad and diverse group to share expertise? What are the criteria
that will be used to assess their submissions? How and why are you
trying to shake things up regarding diversity and inclusion compared to
previous conferences? &#42; \[ \] Attracting attendees: Considered what
kind of photos you use to advertise your event and what kind of message
that sends about diversity and inclusion

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_4}

&#42; \[ \] Invited Speakers: Reached beyond the conference organizers'
own network and the circle of usual suspects to solicit speakers &#42;
\[ \] Review of submitted proposals: There is no 100% guaranteed way to
avoid bias, but have you done everything you can to mitigate bias in the
review process (e.g. by choosing double-blind review)?

## Event Registration

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact_5}

&#42; \[ \] Can registrants request additional accessibility support?
&#42; \[ \] Can registrants specify dietary restrictions, in particular
severe allergies? &#42; \[ \] Can registrants opt out of having their
photos taken at the event? &#42; \[ \] Is there a check-box for
registrants to indicate that they have read the Code of Conduct?

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_5}

&#42; \[ \] Demographic information is better collected during a
post-conference survey, but if you do collect demographic info: are you
thoughtful in what you ask and how so as not to alienate people? &#42;
\[ \] Sufficient measures for anonymity and data security in place

## Check-in

### 🍎 Low effort, high impact {#_low_effort_high_impact_6}

&#42; \[ \] System for photography opt-outs in place (e.g. by adding
sticker or lanyard to conference badge) &#42; \[ \] Pronoun pins
(he/him, she/her, they/them), buttons or ribbons in place (optimally
colour-coded)

## Grants/Scholarships {#grants-scholarships}

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_6}

&#42; \[ \] Offering grants to support attendance of traditionally
underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in technology and/or open
source communities persons (including those who identify as LGBTQ,
indigenous, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities)
who otherwise wouldn't have the means to participate

## Post-Event Assessment

### ✅ High effort, high impact {#_high_effort_high_impact_7}

&#42; \[ \] Post-event survey of participants to establish whether your
diversity and inclusion measures had an effect

# Minimal Measures {#_minimal_measures}

&#42;As a general rule, we encourage conference organizers to implement
all the 🍎 measures and at least one of the ✅ suggestions.&#42;

Making your conference inclusive and encouraging diversity is
achievable. The measures below are explained in more depth in the other
pages of this Cookbook.

## What are the easiest and most impactful measures?

Just follow the measures below. They are explained in more depth in the
other pages of this Cookbook. Measures that are &#42;easy to
implement&#42; and have a &#42;strong positive impact&#42; are
"&#42;low-hanging fruit&#42;" and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.
Measures that take more effort but have considerable impact are marked
with a green checkmark: ✅.

## Organizing Committee {#organizing-committee}

✅ The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want
to create in your conference! Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

Conference chairs and lead organizers should take special care to
recruit an organizing committee that reflects the diversity of the event
you aspire to create.

## Venue Selection &amp; On-Site Services {#venue-selection-on-site-services}

### Accessibility Considerations {#_accessibility_considerations}

&#42; Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability

### Mobility {#_mobility}

&#42; 🍎 Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair,
crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily accessible seats, such as at the
end of a row on the aisle. &#42; 🍎 Create wide aisles between chairs to
make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the
room.

### Disability {#_disability}

&#42; 🍎 Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps. Ask conference
organizers to announce important information over the microphone, which
helps people with impaired vision. &#42; ✅ Book sign-language
interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for
deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees.

## Bathrooms

### Gender-Neutral Bathrooms {#_gender_neutral_bathrooms}

&#42; 🍎 Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what
to do if you think someone is in the "wrong" restroom &#42;&#42; "If you
think someone's gender doesn't match the sign on the door, please follow
these steps: Don't worry about it, they know better than you." (via
\@LGBTplusBristol) &#42; ✅ Ensuring your conference has easily
accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary
and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.

### 🍎 Dedicated rooms {#_dedicated_rooms}

&#42; Dedicated rooms (e.g., those below) should be clearly labeled to
prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both
the print and the online conference directory and maps. &#42; Don't
allow anyone (even organizers) to use dedicated rooms for other
purposes.

### 🍎 Quiet Room {#_quiet_room}

&#42; A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation
of being surrounded by people at the conference. It's intended for quiet
decompression --- no phone calls, talking/socializing, notification
beeps! &#42; People whose religions require frequent prayer may also
need a dedicated space. If possible, provide a separate, nearby room
that allows for quiet personal prayer without disrupting others. If
space is limited, work with the venue to offer a flexible-use room or
provide access upon request. &#42; If a separate room is not possible,
consider "quiet areas" with soft seating, low lighting, and clear
signage.

## Catering {#catering}

Making sure that your attendees have something they can eat at mealtimes
is an important element of building an inclusive and welcoming
conference.

&#42; It's best to have a sign/small label in front of each dish with a
list of ingredients and common labels (e.g. "gluten-free, vegan,
includes peanuts"). &#42;&#42; 🍎 Ask your caterer to create and provide
the labels. &#42; 🍎 Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in
particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated. &#42; ✅ Common dietary
needs to plan for gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, pork-free,
shellfish-free, soy-free, kosher, halal, and nut-free. Shellfish and
peanut especially are usually a serious allergy so take extra care.

## Code of Conduct (CoC) {#code-of-conduct}

### Awareness {#_awareness}

Make sure that everyone involved in your conference/event is aware that
the CoC applies to them: that it not only includes participants, but
also speakers, sponsors, committee members, etc.

&#42; 🍎 Provide a tick box at registration that confirms that the
participant has read the CoC &#42; 🍎 Include a copy of the CoC in the
sponsor packet &#42; 🍎 Mention that the CoC applies to the speakers in
the speaker guidelines &#42; 🍎 Ensure that CoC is easily accessible on
the conference website &#42; 🍎 Include a short version of the CoC on
the printed schedule as a reminder &#42; 🍎 Mention the CoC in the
welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if
there is a problem/violation

## Participant and Speaker Selection {#participant-and-speaker-selection}

### Speakers {#_speakers}

&#42; 🍎 Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks, e.g.,
call for "Speakers who have advice or expertise to share" rather than
"experts in best practices" === Invited Speakers &#42; ✅ Reach beyond
the conference organizers' own networks. Take steps to go out and find
people who might be lesser-known but would make great speakers. Look for
more than just "the usual suspects" and reach out to your wider network
for ideas, suggestions, and introductions.

### Selecting Speakers {#_selecting_speakers}

&#42; 🍎 Call For Proposals instructions -- be clear who you want
&#42;&#42; In the solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad
&amp; diverse group to share their expertise. &#42;&#42; Let applicants
know what criteria will be used to assess their submission and how
speakers will be chosen. &#42;&#42; If your conference has a long
history, and you're trying to change what the program make-up, be up
front about the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how
this may look different from years past.

### Call for Proposals Review {#_call_for_proposals_review}

&#42; ✅ There are many approaches to reviewing and selecting conference
contributions, and there is no foolproof type of review that always
avoids biases. Regardless of which approach you choose, open or
anonymized, we encourage you to make it "double" so that both parties
know each other (double-open) or neither party knows the other
(double-closed)

### Attracting Attendees {#_attracting_attendees}

&#42; 🍎 Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event -
what do people look like who attend?

## Event Registration {#event-registration}

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

### Preparing to meet accessibility needs {#_preparing_to_meet_accessibility_needs}

&#42; 🍎 Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility
needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
&#42;&#42; "Do you need any special accommodations to help make your
time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g., accessibility
considerations). Please \[email - add email here\] and include the
details of your request."

### Dietary Restrictions {#_dietary_restrictions}

&#42; 🍎 Ask for dietary restrictions on the registration form. Some
people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect
their ability to attend the conference.

### Photo Policy {#_photo_policy}

&#42; 🍎 If you will have a photographer at your event, include
information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and
how to opt out in the registration form.

### Code of Conduct {#_code_of_conduct}

&#42; 🍎 Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a have a required
check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

## Inclusive Practices During Check-In

### 🍎 Photography Permissions {#_photography_permissions}

&#42; Managing photography opt-outs: &#42;&#42; You can use badge
lanyards at registration to indicate photo preferences (e.g., green =
photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) === 🍎 Pronoun Pins,
Buttons, or Ribbons &#42; Indicating pronouns: &#42;&#42; Select a label
(pin/button/ribbon/sticker) for your lanyard/badge to communicate your
pronouns. Using one even if you don't feel like you need one helps
create a welcoming space for attendees who do. &#42;&#42;
Color-coordinate the labels by pronoun for quicker recognition and
processing by those who see them. This lowers the barrier to checking
(look at the color).

## Grants/Scholarships {#grants-scholarships}

✅ Offer grants to support attendance

&#42; Eligibility Requirements &#42;&#42; Applicants should be from a
traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the
technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to
persons identifying as LGBTQ, indigenous, women, persons of color,
and/or persons with disabilities &#42;&#42; and be unable to attend
without some financial assistance &lt;&lt;ref1,\[1\]&gt;&gt;.

&#42; Payment &#42;&#42; Typically, recipients either submit receipts
for reimbursement, have direct expenses paid for by the organizing
committee, or are granted a lump sum up-front. &#42;&#42; We encourage
conferences to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay
and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for
people who want to use it. &#42;&#42; Waiting for reimbursement can be a
financial burden on scholarship recipients.

## Assessment of the event

✅ Survey participants after the event to establish whether your
diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority
group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual
participants. You can consider specifically asking about
inclusion/diversity on the survey.

Language adapted from The Linux Foundation's API Strategy &amp; Practice
Conference 2017 diversity scholarship announcement. See press release:
[Linux Foundation Press
Release.](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-linux-foundation-and-open-api-initiative-announce-agenda-for-apistrat-the-api-strategy-practice-conference)

# Organizing Committee {#_organizing_committee}

&#42;Note&#42;: Anyone in the Fedora community who shows genuine
interest in helping out is welcome to organize (be a part of the
committee)

The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to
create in your conference! Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

✅ Conference chairs and lead organizers should take special care to
recruit an organizing committee that reflects the diversity of the event
you aspire to create.If this feels challenging, consider reaching out to
the Fedora DEI team for support, resources, or a short workshop to help
you get started.

&#42; Look for balance along many dimensions: seniority, topical
expertise, geography, academia/industry, gender/racial/ethnic balance,
disability status, academic lineage and many more. &#42; Ensure a good
mix of long-term expertise and institutional memory with a flow of new
people. &#42; Avoid cronyism: Use algorithmic and term-limited
approaches to constitute the steering committee.

When creating the organizing committee, be aware of the specific roles
assigned to individuals. Avoid a situation in which the "housekeeping"
roles are all assigned to women or other individuals from
underrepresented groups. The goal is to achieve diversity across many
roles, including those of high technical prestige.

&#42; Consider having a member of the organizing committee specifically
responsible for mitigating/preventing bias and weaving inclusivity
throughout the conference (e.g. "diversity chair" or co-chairs). &#42;
"We tried, but they turned us down." For both the organizing committee
and also the program committee be ready with "spare" names. Since there
are relatively fewer women and underrepresented minorities in the
community, they are often asked to do disproportionate amounts of
service, and thus are frequently forced to say no at a higher rate.

# Venue Selection &amp; On-Site Services {#_venue_selection_amp_on_site_services}

## Accessibility Considerations {#accessibility-considerations}

&#42; Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability

## Mobility {#mobility}

&#42; 🍎 Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair,
crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily accessible seats, such as at the
end of a row on the aisle. &#42; 🍎 Create wide aisles (2.5 m, so two
power chairs can pass each other) between chairs to make it easier for
people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room. &#42; Reduce
conference sprawl to support access for people who are
mobility-impaired. &#42; Consider marking and enforcing "No Standing
Zones" through rooms such as foyers that are both gathering areas and
regions people must pass through. (A 2.5 m "corridor" marked on the
ground in yellow tape is ideal.) &#42; Consider making remote access
available via livestream, recorded talks, etc. &#42; Make sure the
building is wheelchair accessible. (In the U.S. this is typically
required by law.) &#42; Be aware of how far/near the closest
wheelchair-accessible restrooms are. Attempt to shorten this distance
when possible, and be sure all staff know where to direct attendees who
require a wheelchair-accessible restroom.

## Create Access Visual &amp; Hearing Disabilities {#create-access-visual-hearing-disabilities}

&#42; ✅ Book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning
(someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees.
&#42;&#42; If the budget does not allow for both sign-language
interpreters and captioning, we suggest that you opt for captioning, as
it tends to create more access for a higher number of people. (See
"Further Reading" below.) &#42; Select a venue that has a hearing loop,
or audio induction loop (a special type of sound system for use by
people with hearing aids) and make sure it is used

## Signage

&#42; Consider using patterns rather than just color on signs and
presentation slides to indicate differences, to make comprehension
easier for attendees with color blindness/low vision issues. &#42;
Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps. &#42; Send maps to
attendees in advance, with the event schedule. &#42; Provide large-print
copies of printed materials, such as program booklets, via printing
normally A5 documents on A4, or folded A4-booklets on A3.

## Microphones

&#42; 🍎 Ask conference organizers to announce important information
over the microphone, which helps people with impaired vision. &#42; Make
sure that hand-held microphones are available &#42; Encourage session
chairs to repeat questions from the audience over the mic so everyone
can hear &#42; Session chairs should ensure that the microphone is used
(even if the speaker thinks their voice is loud enough)

## Bathrooms {#bathrooms}

### Gender-Neutral Bathrooms {#_gender_neutral_bathrooms_2}

&#42; Ideally you would provide 3 types of restrooms: gender-neutral,
female, male. &#42; ✅ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible
gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans
individuals feel included and welcome at your conference. &#42; How to
re-label bathrooms: &#42;&#42; 🍎 List the specific amenities and what
type of restroom it is. For example: &#42;&#42; "All Gender Restroom:
Facilities available in this restroom include individual stall toilets,
an accessible stall toilet, urinals, sinks, and a changing table" For
detailed guidelines and examples of inclusive restroom signage, refer to
[Best Practices for All-Gender Restroom
Signage.](https://pridefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/All-Gender-Restrooms.pdf)
&#42;&#42; Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing
what to do if you think someone is in the "wrong" restroom For example:
"If you think someone's gender doesn't match the sign on the door,
please follow these steps: Don't worry about it, they know better than
you." (via [\@LGBTplusBristol](https://twitter.com/lgbtplusbristol))

## Toiletries/Supplies {#toiletries-supplies}

&#42; 🍎 Provide tampons and pads in all restrooms (some people who
identify as male have periods and may need them) &#42; Consider using
fragrance-free hand wash and reducing the use of air fresheners to help
those with chemical sensitivities.

organizers) to use the room for other purposes.

## 🍎 Nursing &amp; Pumping Room {#nursing-pumping-room}

&#42; Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with a locking
door. &#42; For the room to be optimally useful, these things are
desired: &#42;&#42; Locking door &#42;&#42; Comfortable chair (ideally,
with arms that do not have gaps between the armrest and the seat, and a
set of firm cushions for positioning an infant) &#42;&#42; A desk or
table next to the chair (to set the pump, bottles, etc. on), no more
than 4 feet from the nearest electrical outlet &#42;&#42; Cleaning
wipes, paper towels, and a garbage can for maintaining cleanliness
&#42;&#42; Masking tape and a marker for labeling milk bottles and pump
parts &#42;&#42; Proximity to a sink for handwashing and washing of pump
parts &#42;&#42; A refrigerator for storage of pumped milk (could be in
the pumping room, or ideally accessible outside the room but nearby)
&#42;&#42; If possible, a dimmable light or a small lamp could be
provided instead of bright overhead lighting

### 🍎 Gender-Neutral Bottle Feeding Room {#_gender_neutral_bottle_feeding_room}

&#42; Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender and also
benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding. &#42;
This should be a separate, additional room (NOT the same as the nursing
and pumping room). It could accommodate multiple babies at a time and be
equipped with: &#42;&#42; Multiple comfortable chairs with broad
armrests to facilitate bottle feeding positions &#42;&#42; A bottle
warmer &#42;&#42; Paper towels, cleaning wipes and garbage can for
cleanliness &#42;&#42; Dim lighting and in a quiet area of the
conference center/venue &#42;&#42; Clearly labeled to prevent accidental
entry, though a locking door is not necessary

## 🍎 Quiet Room {#quiet-room}

&#42; A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation
of being surrounded by people at the conference. &#42;&#42; No phone
calls, talking/socializing, etc. &#42;&#42; Put notifications on
silent/vibrate. &#42; Ideal is to provide one well lit quiet room, and a
second dimly lit room. &#42; Consider "quiet areas" if a separate room
is not possible.

# Catering {#_catering}

Many Fedora events don't provide full catering, but it's still important
to help attendees find safe, accessible food options.

&#42;🍎 If you are not providing catering:&#42;

&#42; Share a list of nearby restaurants, cafes, or grocery stores,
including the types of food they serve and any dietary accommodations
(e.g., vegan-friendly, halal, gluten-free). &#42; Include details like
hours, distance from the venue, and whether reservations are
recommended.

&#42;🍎 If you plan to provide any snacks or meals on-site:&#42;

&#42; Label each dish clearly with ingredients and common dietary tags
(e.g., gluten-free, vegan, contains peanuts). &#42; Offer a variety of
beverages, especially non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated options. &#42;
Be aware of common dietary needs: Gluten free, Dairy free, Vegan and
vegetarian, Pork free, Shellfish free, Soy free, Nut free (especially
peanuts---take extra care), Kosher, Halal &#42;Tip:&#42; Even if you
only offer light snacks, clear labeling and variety go a long way in
making everyone feel included.

# Code of Conduct (CoC) {#_code_of_conduct_coc}

&#42; 🍎 Articulate a Code of Conduct for your event &#42; Get inspired
by Codes of Conduct that have been phrased for other conferences (see
also "Further Reading")

## Goals

A Code of Conduct should:

&#42; Be easy to read (You shouldn't need a law degree to understand
it.) &#42; Be easy to find &#42; Explain how to report problematic or
unethical behavior &#42; Explain the consequences of violating Code of
Conduct provisions &#42; Include timelines/deadlines for enforcement
action that will be taken

Additional ways to support and implement your Code of Conduct:

&#42; Include FAQs &#42; Encourage positive behavior (don't just
discourage negative behavior) &#42; Have a "quick" version and a "less
quick" version (e.g. [JSConf](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html))

## Awareness {#awareness}

Make sure that everyone involved in your conference/event is aware that
the Code of Conduct applies to them: that not only includes
participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.

&#42; 🍎 Tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has
read the Code of Conduct &#42;&#42; A pop-up with a short version may
also be a good idea. &#42;&#42; Provide a link to the full ("less
quick") version of the Code of Conduct, hosted on its own page. &#42; 🍎
Include a copy of the Code of Conduct in the sponsor packet &#42; 🍎
Mention that the Code of Conduct applies to the speakers in the speaker
guidelines &#42; 🍎 Ensure that the Code of Conduct is easily accessible
on the conference website &#42;&#42; Should be in main navigation or in
the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of
service) &#42;&#42; Implement additional web-based highlights of the CoC
via loading pages, pop-ups, screen savers, etc. &#42; 🍎 Include a short
version of the Code of Conduct on the printed schedule as a reminder
&#42; 🍎 Mention the Code of Conduct in the welcome talk and at the
start of every day, including who to contact if there is a
problem/violation &#42; 🍎 Place Code of Conduct reminders on tables at
lunch and also signs in rooms reminding people during the day &#42; 🍎
Create a large banner sign at key entrances on the Code of Conduct as a
reminder. &#42; If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on
"Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable" &#42;
"Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about
any matter of concern, no matter how small." &#42; Include short blurbs
about the Code of Conduct during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on
websites, etc. &#42; Consider a visual "workflow" of Code of Conduct
violation: &#42;&#42; Report -&gt; Action -&gt; Resolution &#42; Make it
clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

## Reporting

&#42; Ensure confidentiality of the person who is reporting the
violation (and the alleged violator) &#42; Ensure that the data is
stored securely with limited access &#42; Make sure that people are
aware of reporting mechanisms: &#42;&#42; Face to face with staff (Who
is the dedicated ombudsperson or -persons?) &#42;&#42; Dedicated email,
e.g. to <codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org> &#42;&#42; Open an issue here
on Pagure; <https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue> &#42; Consider how a report
against an authority figure would be submitted --- e.g. if the
ombudsperson is the subject of a CoC violation report, who is the report
submitted to? (A good reason to have more than one ombudsperson.)

## Enforcement

&#42; Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take
an action on the violation &#42; Discuss in advance with the organizing
committee what the specific process will be for recording and addressing
a CoC violation &#42; When possible, have a third party review the
violation report (Another good way to handle the challenge of potential
reports against authority figures.) &#42; Ensure the person who made the
CoC violation report is aware of how it is being handled and when it has
been resolved.

# Grants/Scholarships {#_grantsscholarships}

Why funding is important

Registration vs. Travel &amp; Lodging

&#42; Registration waiver scholarships can be highly effective in
creating opportunities for underrepresented folks to attend your event.
&#42;&#42; Most [PyData](http://www.pydata.org/) Diversity Scholarship
recipients indicated that receiving funding to cover registration was
make-or-break for their ability to attend. &#42; However, registration
waivers alone often aren't enough. &#42;&#42; Sometimes
[PyData](http://www.pydata.org/) Diversity Scholarship recipients who
didn't have additional outside sources of funding for travel &amp;
lodging were unable to attend even though their registration was
covered. &#42;&#42; Interest in [Galaxy
fellowships](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2017-03-gcc2017-fellowships/)
went up when covering the first \$n of travel costs was added, as well.

✅ Offer grants to support attendance

&#42; Eligibility Requirements &#42;&#42; Applicants should be
&#42;&#42;&#42; from a traditionally underrepresented and/or
marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities
including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, indigenous,
women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities
&#42;&#42;&#42; and be unable to attend without some financial
assistance &lt;&lt;ref1,\[1\]&gt;&gt;. &#42;&#42; Also consider
providing support for applicants from developing economies.
&#42;&#42;&#42; You might use the [World Bank
definitions](http://bit.ly/1nO82wD) of low and low-middle income.
&#42;&#42; Your organizing committee should decide which career stages
are eligible: Everyone? Just students and post-docs? Junior
faculty/researchers? Unemployed? &#42; The legal issues of specifically
funding underrepresented groups varies by country. &#42;&#42;
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) deals with this by having a
separate entity (the Galaxy Community Fund) offer sponsorships. &#42;
Payment &#42;&#42; Supported participants are often required to cover
various expenses up front, with the expectation of reimbursement from
the sponsor. However, this can be difficult for many participants who
may not have the financial resources to do so. &#42;&#42;&#42; To
mitigate this issue, sponsors should cover as many expenses as possible
directly, including flights, hotels (and deposits), and other major
costs. &#42;&#42;&#42; For expenses that cannot be paid directly,
sponsors can utilize systems like Ramp, which allow for the creation of
virtual credit cards. These cards can be assigned to supported
participants, ensuring that expenses are charged directly to the
sponsor, eliminating the need for participants to pay out of pocket.
&#42;&#42; Typically, recipients either submit receipts for
reimbursement, have direct expenses paid for by the organizing
committee, or are granted a lump sum up-front. &#42;&#42; We encourage
conferences to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay
and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for
people who want to use it. &#42;&#42;&#42; Waiting for reimbursement can
be a financial burden on scholarship recipients.

Where to seek funding

&#42; How to attract funding for scholarships? &#42;&#42; Consider
posting an opportunity for attendees or community members to make
individual donations in support of travel scholarships. &#42;&#42; Make
corporate sponsor levels specifically tied to travel+lodging and/or
registration scholarships. (e.g. [PyData offers Diversity Scholarships
as sponsor benefits](https://pydata.org/pdf/sponsor-prospectus.pdf))
&#42;&#42; Run a crowdfunding campaign to support particular inclusion
efforts (e.g. childcare expenses --- [Open Source Bridge did
this](https://web.archive.org/web/20160527052000/http://opensourcebridge.org/blog/2016/05/childcare-and-scholarships/).
&#42;&#42; Dedicate surpluses from previous events to funding
fellowships.

&#42; Possible Funding Sources (needs more research) &#42;&#42; [Python

# Participant and Speaker Selection {#_participant_and_speaker_selection}

## Speakers {#speakers}

## Invited Speakers

&#42; ✅ Reach beyond the conference organizers' own networks. Take
steps to go out and find people who might be lesser-known but would make
great speakers. Look for more than just "the usual suspects" and reach
out to your wider network for ideas, suggestions, and introductions.
&#42; Identify a group of people to solicit as conference speakers
&#42;&#42; Take extra steps to ensure a diverse speaker pool
&#42;&#42;&#42; Make the list of potential speakers who are
underrepresented longer than the list of usual suspects (e.g. --- have a
longer list of women than men), so when someone declines or drops out
you can just move to the next one on the list. Underrepresented folks
are often overburdened with speaking requests, hence the need for a
longer list. &#42;&#42; Keep and maintain a list of possible speakers
with expertise and their contact info &#42;&#42; Research and follow
speaker lists compiled by other organizations and communities &#42;&#42;
When querying your network for speaker ideas, specifically ask for
suggestions of speakers who could contribute to the diversity of the
speaker line-up &#42;&#42; If your system is to have speakers come to
you &amp; ask, but research shows they tend not to do so, they won't
come. &#42; 🍎 Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks
(subtlety can make a big difference) &#42;&#42; E.g. "Experts in best
practices" may turn away people who don't self-identify as "expert" or
who have impostor syndrome. &#42;&#42; "Speakers who have advice or
expertise to share" &gt; Everyone has some level of expertise or
knowledge to share about what they work on, so this phrasing is more
inclusive and inviting. &#42; Ensure panels and roundtables include a
diversity of participants &#42;&#42; Make strategic use of the moderator
role to help support diverse participation

## Selecting Speakers {#selecting-speakers}

&#42; 🍎 Call For Proposals (CFP) instructions &#42;&#42; In the
solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad &amp; diverse group
to share their expertise. &#42;&#42; Let applicants know what criteria
will be used to assess their submission and how speakers will be chosen.
&#42;&#42; If possible, create detailed instructions and/or run
workshops to help prepare people to write strong proposals. &#42;&#42;
Be clear in who you want &#42;&#42;&#42; If your conference has a long
history and you're trying to change what it's like, be up front about
the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how this may look
different from years past. &#42;&#42; Consider carefully the way you
describe your event and the call for proposals in order to avoid turning
away or self-de-selecting of potential speakers.

&#42; Offer speaker training &#42;&#42; Let potential speakers know
there are resources to help them prepare, and provide them. &#42;&#42;
Ask potential speakers to ensure the content of their talk abides by the
code of conduct &#42;&#42; Consider color-blindness in slide design
&#42;&#42; Provide handouts of slides and/or transcripts (both large and
small format) &#42;&#42; Verbally describe graphs and illustrations

## Incentivize First-Time Speakers:

&#42; E.g. "We are looking to diversify our speaker panel; we want to
select a cohort of first-time speakers to ensure we continue to offer
professional development opportunities to everyone in the community."

## Attracting Attendees {#attracting-attendees}

&#42; Be clear about what your event is about, explain it to people who
are less familiar and haven't attended before. &#42; 🍎 Pay attention to
the photos you use to advertise your event---what do people look like
who attend? &#42; Partner with organizations whose membership you'd like
to convince to attend your event. &#42; Offer scholarships for
first-time and underrepresented attendees. &#42; Advertise the Code of
Conduct to convey that you are seeking an inclusive environment.

## Call For Proposals review ("double-blind" vs "affirmative action") {#call-for-proposals-review}

&#42; "Open" versus "Blind" or "Closed" Review &#42;&#42; "Open" review
is a form of review in which the names of the reviewers are made public.
&#42;&#42; "Double-Open" review is when the reviewers know the identity
of the proposal author and the proposal author also knows the identity
of their reviewers &#42;&#42; "Double Blind" review means the reviewers
do not know the identity of the proposal author and vice versa.
&#42;&#42; "Single Blind" or simply "Blind" review means that the author
of the proposal does not know the identity of the reviewers. &#42;&#42;
Sometimes the term "Closed" or "Anonymized" is used instead of "Blind".
&#42; Double "Blind" Review &#42;&#42; By changing speaker selection to
completely "blind," you may be able to increase representation from
traditionally underrepresented groups. (See "Further Reading" below.)
&#42;&#42; You might create a CFP form that instructs the submitter to
withhold identifying information. &#42;&#42; You can assign 1-2 people
to remove the identifying information from submissions before passing
them to the next group of reviewers/the assessing team. &#42;&#42;&#42;
However, be aware that it's not always possible to do this, particularly
if the work is tightly tied to the authors, or is based on their past
work, and that reviewers can often determine authors even when they
technically shouldn't. Reviewers may also search for information about
the subject of the work, which can lead them to a preprint of the
submitted material with the authors listed. In this case, you may want
to explicitly instruct the reviewers to try not to consider information
about the authors they happen to know or find. &#42;&#42; If you
recognize a submission author and you're on the review committee, you
should not grade the submission---recuse yourself from reviewing that
submission. Of course, if the process is double-blind, you may not be
aware that you have a conflict with it. &#42;&#42; Optionally, the
review team can de-anonymize after the review process to ensure that the
final selection is representative of the diverse grouping that is
desired.

&#42; Double Open Review &#42;&#42; Reviewers know who the proposal
authors are and proposal authors know who the reviewers are. &#42;&#42;
Some believe that open reviews are higher quality than anonymous
reviewers, as the reviewers have to stand behind their comments.
&#42;&#42; [Sample guidelines for reviewers in double open review
systems](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/chair-reviewer-guidelines)

&#42; ✅ Regardless of which approach you choose, open or anonymized, we
encourage you to make it "double" so that both parties know each other
(double-open) or neither party knows the other (double-closed)

# Event Registration {#_event_registration}

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

## Preparing to meet accessibility needs {#preparing-to-meet-accessibility-needs}

&#42; Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the
registration form. Then: &#42; 🍎 Ask registrants if they have any
additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how
to make the request. &#42;&#42; "Do you need any special accommodations
to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive?
(e.g. accessibility considerations). Please contact the DEI team and let
them know the details of your request." &#42; Provide any deadlines for
requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at
the last minute, for example).

## Supporting Attendance through Grants

&#42; Ask about any grant or scholarship opportunities, e.g. for
childcare, scholarships for underrepresented folks &#42;&#42; "Would you
be interested in a grant to cover childcare or on-site childcare
services? (yes/no) Which option would be most beneficial for you?"

## Dietary Restrictions {#dietary-restrictions}

&#42; 🍎 Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that
can affect their ability to attend the conference. &#42; Use an open
text box to ask about dietary restrictions. (Forcing registrants to
choose from a pre-defined list might miss important allergies or
restrictions.) &#42;&#42; "Do you have any dietary restrictions we
should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)"

## Photo Policy {#photo-policy}

&#42; 🍎 If you will have a photographer at your event, include
information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and
how to opt out. &#42;&#42; (see lanyard/photography explanation under
Inclusive Practices)

&#42;Further reading&#42;:

&#42; [Geek Feminism
Photography](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Photography)

## Code of Conduct {#code-of-conduct}

&#42; 🍎 Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box
that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

## T-Shirts

If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit
of shirt.

&#42; Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where
you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including
plus-size.) &#42; Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g.
"fitted" vs. "straight-cut") with photo examples, rather than using
gender-loaded terms ("men's," "women's," "unisex").

Community](http://cczona.com/unisex-swag-shirts-are-harming-your-community/)

## Demographic Info

&#42; Why do you need it? &#42;&#42; We recommend you do not ask for
information just "out of curiosity" but rather that there are planned
actions you will take depending on the results of your demographic
question(s). &#42;&#42; If you are asking just for the purpose of
"counting" or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest
doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead, to protect
participant privacy. &#42; If you absolutely must include demographic
info in your registration form, make it optional, not required. Forcing
people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an
inclusive practice and may prompt stereotype threat. &#42; ✅ If you do
collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the
questions so that they are inclusive and don't contribute to alienating
or "othering" marginalized people. &#42;&#42; Not having an answer
choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
&#42; ✅ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for
limiting access to this information and keeping it secure. &#42;
Suggested format for demographic question: &#42;&#42; "Do you
self-identify as an underrepresented minority in either the
\[conference\] community or in your professional field?" &#42;&#42;&#42;
"Along which dimension(s) you self-identify as underrepresented? Check
all that apply:" &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Gender identity
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Ethnicity, nationality, skin color, race
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Sexual orientation &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
Socioeconomic status &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Religion &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
Age &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Ability &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Do not wish to
provide &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Other (please specify)

registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences
(green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos)

## 🍎 Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

&#42; Indicating pronouns: &#42;&#42; Select a pin/button/ribbon for
your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't
feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who
do. &#42;&#42; Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker
recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the
barrier to checking (look at the color). &#42;&#42;&#42; Be sure to
choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With
color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather
than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case,
they're more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the
stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
&#42;&#42;&#42; To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily
seen. Make the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word
"Pronouns". &#42;&#42; Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
&#42;&#42;&#42; Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a "Fill in your
own" ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers.

## Welcoming New Attendees

&#42; Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. "First-Time Attendee."
&#42;&#42; Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage
with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
&#42; Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced
attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly
resource to get to know the conference.

## Social Events

&#42; "First-Time Attendee" lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and
safe place for attendees to ask questions. &#42; Consider diversifying
the time of day that social events happen. &#42;&#42; Not everyone is
available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events
are typically concentrated. &#42; Alcohol Considerations &#42;&#42; We
recommend the [AdaCamp Toolkit's summary approach to alcohol at
events](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

# Assessment of the event {#_assessment_of_the_event}

✅ Survey participants after the event to establish whether your
diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority
group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual
participants. You can consider specifically asking about diversity and
inclusion on the survey.

## Practical considerations

&#42; Have a plan in place to analyze the data shortly after the event
-- this can be time-consuming and you will need lots of helping hands to
clean data &#42; Make sure you review the survey outcomes after the
meeting with your organizing committee &#42; Communicate any findings to
the next organizing committee if the conference/event is part of a
series

&#42;Further Reading&#42; Be sure to check out the Event Registration
section on ["Demographic
Info"](event-checklist:event-registration.adoc&#35;demographic-info)
before undertaking any survey that asks participants for information on
their identity.

# Contributing {#_contributing}

Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team invites the community to give
feedback and make suggestions for improvements to this guide via [merge
request (MR)](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/docs/-/merge_requests). MRs
will be evaluated by the Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team and/or its
volunteers. MRs should be written so as to conform to the [Fedora Code
of
Conduct](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/).

For a full statement of the Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team mission
and our work, please see <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/>

&#42;IMPORTANT NOTE ON LEAVING FEEDBACK, PLEASE READ&#42;: Thanks for
your help in supporting the DEI Team to build these guidelines. Here are
a few things to keep in mind before you proceed to give feedback.

&#42; Everything mentioned here is a suggestion and none of the
guidelines are compulsory for Fedora event organizers. For more
information, please read the 'How to use this guide' section in the main
page before you proceed to give feedback. &#42; These guidelines are
written for all event organizers in Fedora eg. from local community
events like release parties to global conferences like FLOCK. &#42; Your
feedback will be extremely valuable to help us improve it and to build
DEI in the Fedora community.

Here are some pointers to think about when leaving feedback on this
document :

&#42; What do you think of general rule for evaluation mentioned in 'How
to use this guide' section i.e. "As a general rule, we encourage
conference organizers to implement all of the 🍎 measures and at least
one of the ✅ suggestions." &#42;&#42; Is this feasible for smaller
local community events like Release Parties? &#42;&#42; For global
community conferences eg. FLOCK, should this rule be different? If so,
what?

&#42; Select a section of interest and think about the following for
each of the suggested guidelines in that section: &#42;&#42; Is this
relevant for the Fedora community? If no, why not and how can we make it
more relevant? &#42;&#42; As an event organizer, &#42;&#42;&#42; Is this
guideline clearly understandable? If not, what is unclear?
&#42;&#42;&#42; What are the efforts (low, medium, high) and impact
(low, medium, high) needed to implement this guideline as an organizer
of a local Fedora community event eg. Release Party?
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; For example, please identify "low effort- high
impact" guidelines as 🍎and "high effort-high impact" guidelines as ✅
&#42;&#42;&#42; Do you need more resources to implement this guideline
and/or support from Fedora DEI Team?

# Events {#_events}

The Events section of the Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion
(DEI) Team Docs aims to build a Fedora Diversity events calendar and
identify regional events for participation. Our focus is on supporting
minority-specific events to promote a more inclusive environment across
the Fedora Community, we target minority-specific events.

Our mission is to &#42;embed inclusivity into all Fedora events&#42; and
to &#42;expand Fedora's reach into historically marginalized
regions&#42; through meaningful and well-supported participation.

## Making Fedora events inclusive {#_making_fedora_events_inclusive}

Inclusivity should be a part of all Fedora events and activities. Here
are some best practices to consider when planning an event with your
community:

&#42; Design sessions that are hybrid or remote-friendly &#42; Include
speakers, panelist and/or contributors from diverse backgrounds &#42;
Share the [Code of
Conduct](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/)
clearly before the event &#42; Provide translation or interpretation, if
possible &#42; Choose accessible venues and platforms

## Hosting events in marginalized regions {#_hosting_events_in_marginalized_regions}

We want to support Fedora events in regions where open source is still
growing - such as parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and more. This
requires thoughtful planning.

Here's how to support that:

&#42; Partner with local schools or tech communities &#42; Offer support
for travel, internet access, or event costs (e.g., swag for
contributors) &#42; Use local languages and culturally aware
communication &#42; Connect local organizers with Fedora mentors

## Upcoming events {#_upcoming_events}

If you're looking for upcoming events, you can check [Fedora events
calendar](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org//Events/) for a list of
official community activities.

We would love to support you, and if you want to plan or have an
upcoming event, or even want to help us with upcoming events, you can
get in touch with the [DEI
team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/get-involved/) or [Fedora
DEI
adviser](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/roles/council-advisor/).

This section is a living document --- your stories, feedback, and
contributions help keep it real.

# Social Events in Fedora {#_social_events_in_fedora}

Fedora social events are fun, welcoming spaces where people can connect,
share, and build community. They happen during bigger conferences like
&#42;Flock&#42;, or as part of smaller events or local meetups.

These events are open to everyone - you don't have to be an expert. The
goal is to create a relaxed space where people can hang out, swap
stories, play games, and enjoy being part of the Fedora community - they
make Fedora feel more human and inclusive.

&#42;Tip&#42;: Focus on small, easy-to-join activities, give clear
instructions, and always invite newcomers to jump in. It's okay if
things aren't perfect - what really matters is people showing up and
learning.

## Examples of Fedora DEI Social events {#_examples_of_fedora_dei_social_events}

We've organized various activities in the past, below are some of the
examples we've hosted at past Fedora gatherings:

# Fedora Week of Diversity {#_fedora_week_of_diversity}

![Fedora Week of Diversity logo.](ROOT:fwd/fwd.png)

[Fedora Week of
Diversity](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/events/past-events/&#35;_fedora_week_of_diversity_fwd)
highlights and celebrates the contributions of diverse contributors and
communities across Fedora and the wider open source ecosystem.

Originally started as [Fedora Women's
Day](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/events/past-events/&#35;_fedora_womens_day_fwd)
to recognize and uplift women contributors, this event has evolved into
Fedora Week of Diversity to better reflect our community's commitment to
inclusion across regions, cultures, and backgrounds.

Each year, Fedora contributors come together to share experiences,
spotlight community achievements, and help more people discover how they
can get involved in free and open source software. Fedora Week of
Diversity is also an opportunity to strengthen regional communities,
amplify underrepresented voices, and create a welcoming environment for
everyone.

## How to participate {#_how_to_participate}

Fedora Week of Diversity is designed to be flexible and the focus for
each year may change - past themes have included [&#42;Empowering
Diversity, Enriching Communities&#42;
(2024)](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/fwd-2024/cfp). Because of this,
how you participate can vary; for example, you might share a personal
story or blog post, record an interview or podcast, or thank
contributors publicly.

Note: Organizers will share themes and details each year. Watch the
Fedora [Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/),
[Discourse](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/), or [DEI team Matrix
channel](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;dei:fedoraproject.org) to stay
updated.

## How to organize Fedora events {#_how_to_organize_fedora_events}

Organizing FWD takes effort and in this section, we're going to lay down
the foundations of how to organize one. Anyone can help organize a local
or virtual event organized by the DEI team. This guide shows you how you
can get started and run a smooth, inclusive event.

## Pre-Planning (3-6 months before) {#_pre_planning_3_6_months_before}

Before anything else:

&#42; Decide on event format (virtual / local / hybrid) &#42; Brainstorm
a theme or focus (e.g. \'Stories from the Community\', \'First
Contribution Day\', "open Source journeys", "Fedora Around the World")
&#42; Create [a Fedora DEI GitLab
ticket](https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/dei/-/issues). Use this to
request support for the FWD activities. &#42; For funding support,
follow the process outlined by the [Fedora Mindshare
Committee](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/).
Budget requests should go through them. Be sure to plan early and
clearly explain what you need. &#42; Think about what you'll need:
speakers, hosts, swags, venue or platform?

### Coordinate with the Fedora DEI Team {#_coordinate_with_the_fedora_dei_team}

Then these steps below are mandatory and important to follow in that
order:

&#42; &#42;Open a ticket&#42; in the [Fedora DEI GitLab
repository](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/issues).
&#42; &#42;Discuss your ticket&#42; during the &#42;Fedora DEI bi-weekly
meeting&#42; to get feedback, guidance, and alignment. &#42; &#42;Stay
connected via Matrix&#42; for follow-up questions, coordination, and
real-time updates.

(For any event that requires funding, swag, or promotion help - the DEI
GitLab ticket is the first and most important step.)

## Recommended timeline {#_recommended_timeline}

It is easier to manage your event when you have a clear timeline
beforehand. Below is a recommended timeline to help you stay on track
from concept to post-event wrap-up.

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Timeline             | Task                                          |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 5--6 months before   | Propose event via [GitLab DEI                 |
|                      | ticket](https://gitl                          |
|                      | ab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/issues) |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 4 months before      | Confirm date, format, venue(if in-person)     |
|                      | speakers &amp; visuals                        |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 3 months before      | Request support (promotion, mentorship, or    |
|                      | budget) via your GitLab ticket                |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 2 months before      | Launch call for participation (optional)\     |
|                      | (Invite community members to participate)     |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1 month before       | Promote your event on social media and Fedora |
|                      | channels                                      |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1 week before        | Send/post final reminders, do a tech check or |
|                      | dry run                                       |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Event day            | Run the event! 🎉                             |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1--3 days after      | Share blog recap + community highlights       |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

## Promote your event {#_promote_your_event}

Make it easy for people to find and join your event:

&#42; Use hashtags like &#42;&#35;FWD(year, eg. FWD2025)&#42; or one
relevant to your event. &#42; &#42;Add a picture or poster&#42; if you
have one. Make sure it's easy to read and not too crowded. In case you
don't have a designer in the team - reach out to the design team to
create one for you. &#42; &#42;Tag relevant Fedora accounts&#42; and
other people or groups who might be interested. &#42; &#42;Write
clearly&#42; -- tell people what the event is, when it is, who should
come, and what they'll learn. &#42; &#42;Post in multiple places&#42; :
Fedora Discourse, Matrix, X(twitter), Instagram, Mastodon, and in local
communities. &#42; &#42;Post more than once&#42; -- share early, remind
people a few days before, and post during or after the event too. &#42;
&#42;Coordinate with the [Fedora Marketing
Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/marketing/need-help/)&#42;
early, as they're really helpful in supporting and amplifying your
event.

## Contributor roles {#_contributor_roles}

It is good to divide and assign tasks, meaning clear roles make sure
everyone knows what to do - and it gives new contributors a chance to
step up.

Typical roles include: Project management, Event production, Speaker
management, Content and promotion and Design. Check the [Week of
Diversity GitLab
README](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/blob/main/README.md)
for more.

You don't need a huge team - a few people can make it happen.

(These roles are adopted from Fedora Week of Diversity(FWD), which has
successfully used this structure to organize FWD events.)

## Post-Event Wrap-up {#_post_event_wrap_up}

You did it! Now it's time to document your impact and celebrate your
team.

&#42; Thank speakers, organizing team and attendees &#42; Share a short
blog post or Discourse recap (with photos or quotes), check [FWD2024
recap](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/recap-of-fedora-week-of-diversity-2024/124450).
&#42; Submit your GitLab wrap-up note with: &#42;&#42; What worked
&#42;&#42; What could be improved &#42;&#42; Participant feedback (if
any)

This will help us all learn and grow - and it makes your event part of
Fedora's living history.

# Events {#_events_2}

The Fedora Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Team has supported
and organized several events over the years. These events celebrate
community stories, foster inclusive spaces, and connect contributors
globally and locally. Below is a record of some of our key initiatives:

## Regional community events {#_regional_community_events}

### [Fedora event at Murang'a University](https://fedoramagazine.org/were-in-kenya-fedora-at-muranga-university/) {#_fedora_event_at_muranga_university}

&#42;&#42; On March 28th, 2025, [Cornelius
Emase](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lochipi) hosted an info
session about open source (Fedora) at Muranga university of technology.
The event focused on introducing students to Fedora, open source
contribution paths, and community building. &#42;&#42; Impact factors
that contributed to its success: &#42;&#42;&#42; Partnered with
university faculty to secure a venue and promote the event
&#42;&#42;&#42; Used beginner-friendly materials suitable for new
contributors &#42;&#42;&#42; Provided actionable next steps (community
links, Fedora Magazine articles, and Quick Docs) &#42;&#42;&#42;
Designed a future engagement plan (virtual contribution workshop)
&#42;&#42; What Worked Well: &#42;&#42;&#42; Collaborating with local
institutions improved credibility and turnout &#42;&#42;&#42; Leveraging
personal contributor stories helped attendees connect with Fedora
&#42;&#42;&#42; The session increased participant confidence on open
source &#42;&#42;&#42; Localized communication ensured better
understanding and inclusivity

You can read the full recap here: [Fedora Magazine blog
post](https://fedoramagazine.org/were-in-kenya-fedora-at-muranga-university/),
and the [highlights here](https://mut-fedora-event.vercel.app/).

## Build pathways for the community: Beyond events {#_build_pathways_for_the_community_beyond_events}

To truly support contributors from marginalized regions, DEI events must
connect attendees to long-term opportunities and the possible ways we
can retain them:

&#42; Industry connections and job pipelines &#42; Global-local
mentorships &#42; Training and skill-building follow-ups &#42; Fedora
swag and material support &#42; Inclusion in Fedora working groups and
decision spaces

This page is maintained by the Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion
(DEI) Team. If you'd like to suggest changes or add your event, [contact
the team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/get-involved/) or
[the DEI
Adviser](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/roles/council-advisor/).

# FWD organizer resource pack {#_fwd_organizer_resource_pack}

In this page you can find a resource pack that helps in organizing a
successful [Fedora Week of Diversity](events:about-fwd.xml) event. The
points below can be used in the event organizer's agenda:

&#42; How to welcome contributors to Fedora &#42; A summary about Fedora
D.E.I. team &#42; Overview of different Fedora editions &#42; Fedora and
Python

## How to welcome new contributors to Fedora? {#_how_to_welcome_new_contributors_to_fedora}

Did you come across folks who are interested in contributing to the
Fedora project? Then please create [Welcome to Fedora
ticket](https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues) for the
newcomers with Fedora Join SIG. This ticket helps them to easily track
their progress in the journey to becoming Fedora contributors. Find more
information about the welcome ticket process
[here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/welcome/welcome/).

Need help with creating the welcome ticket? Reach out to Fedora Join SIG
at any of their [Communication
channels](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/&#35;communication).

## About Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team {#_about_fedora_diversity_equity_amp_inclusion_team}

At your event, start with an introduction to the Fedora Diversity,
Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team. Explain the role of D.E.I. team in the
Fedora community and its upcoming goals. Share our [team's introduction
page](ROOT:index.xml) with anyone who is interested in learning more.

What is the role of Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Team?

:   As the name indicates, the main goal of the D.E.I. team is to foster
    diversity, equity, and inclusion in Fedora community. Below are some
    of the many efforts focused by D.E.I. team to achieve its goal:
    &#42; Creating content and organizing events to spread awareness
    about diversity within and outside Fedora community (like Fedora
    Week of Diversity!) &#42; Supporting community building and
    engagement activities to promote inclusion &#42; Coordinate with
    Fedora sub-projects to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in
    the community &#42; Supporting programs committed to building
    diversity, equity, and inclusion in Free and Open Source Software
    communities

What the D.E.I. team works on?

:   The D.E.I. team works on various tasks to support diversity, equity,
    and inclusion in the Fedora Project. For example, new additions were
    made to the 2018 [Fedora Flock
    conference](https://flocktofedora.org/) such as including
    gender-neutral bathrooms, a quiet room, and communication preference
    stickers. These additions in turn supported our existing effort to
    draft [event inclusion
    guidelines](https://pagure.io/fedora-diversity/issue/54) for Fedora
    event organizers. These guidelines when shared within and outside
    Fedora community provide best practices to organizers holding an
    event. In the past, we also worked on a [Fedora Project Demographic
    Survey](survey:index.xml) to understand who is in the Fedora
    Community.

Community Script

:   Hi, my name is *\_\_\_*, I am from *\_\_\_*, I am *\_\_\_*, and I
    speak *\_\_\_*. We are from different countries, We speak different
    languages, We are of different cultures, But Fedora unites us with
    Open Source. WE ARE FEDORA!

## Fedora Editions {#_fedora_editions}

{FWIKI}/Editions\[Fedora Editions\] are the flagship configurations of
Fedora offered by the Fedora Project. They are promoted on the
[getfedora.org](https://getfedora.org/) website. Each Edition has a
different use case and audience as explained below.

### Fedora Workstation {#_fedora_workstation}

[Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/workstation/) is a primary
desktop configuration offered by Fedora. Fedora workstation is a great
choice for someone looking to use a Linux on their desktop or learn to
develop in a Linux environment. It ships the [GNOME Desktop
Environment](https://www.gnome.org/), includes latest versions of
programming languages and libraries, and is easy to make a [bootable USB
stick](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-fedora-usb-stick/).

&#42; For a comprehensive description of updates and new features, see
the official release notes
[here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/).

### Fedora Server {#_fedora_server}

[Fedora Server](https://getfedora.org/server/) is a primary server
configuration offered by Fedora. This makes a good choice for seasoned
system administrators, allowing them to work with latest technologies
from the open source community. This is a short-lifecycled,
community-supported server environment. Fedora Server features
[Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/), [FreeIPA identity
management](https://www.freeipa.org/page/About), and the brand-new
[Fedora Server Modular Edition](https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/).

See recent features to Fedora Server
[here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/sysadmin/).

### Fedora Silverblue {#_fedora_silverblue}

[Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) is a variant
of Fedora Workstation. It looks, feels and behaves like a regular
desktop operating system giving an experience is similar to a standard
Fedora Workstation.

However, unlike other operating systems, Silverblue is immutable. This
means that every installation is identical to every other installation
of the same version. The operating system that is on disk is exactly the
same from one machine to the next, and it never changes as it is used.

### Fedora CoreOS {#_fedora_coreos}

[Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/) is an automatically
updating, minimal, monolithic, container-focused operating system
designed for clusters but also operable standalone. This is optimized
for Kubernetes but also works great without it. It aims to combine the
best of both CoreOS Container Linux and Fedora Atomic Host, by
integrating Ignition technology from Container Linux with rpm-ostree and
SELinux hardening from Project Atomic. The goal of this edition is to
provide the best container host to run containerized workloads securely
and at scale.

### Fedora IoT {#_fedora_iot}

[Fedora IoT](iot:ROOT:index.xml) or Fedora Internet of Things provides a
strong foundation for IoT ecosystems. Whether you're working on a
project at home, industrial gateways, smart cities or analytics with
AI/ML, Fedora IoT can provide a trusted open source platform to build
on. Fedora IoT rolling releases help you keep your ecosystem up-to-date.

## Fedora Objectives {#_fedora_objectives}

> The primary role of the Fedora Council is to identify the short,
> medium, and long term goals of the Fedora community and to organize
> and enable the project to best achieve them. Each objective has a
> designated Objective Lead who is responsible for coordinating efforts
> to reach the Objective's goals, for evaluating and reporting on
> progress, and for working regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora
> to ensure that progress is made.
>
> --- 
> \_\'From_https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/objectives/\[Fedora_Objectives\]\'

# Fedora and Outreachy {#_fedora_and_outreachy}

Fedora proudly participates in Outreachy to foster diversity, equity,
inclusion, and long-term contributor growth in open source.

## What is Outreachy? {#_what_is_outreachy}

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides paid, remote
internships to people underrepresented in tech. Fedora participates
regularly and mentors a range of Outreachy projects - from technical to
community-focused welcoming newcomers into our open source world.

The internship runs twice a year, and lasts 3 months.

Our goal is to increase participation in Fedora. Please see [the main
page](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/) with program details for the
general information, such as timeline, background information,
eligibility, requirements, and the application form.

## Why do Fedora participate in the Outreachy program? {#_why_do_fedora_participate_in_the_outreachy_program}

Fedora believes in building an inclusive project where everyone has the
opportunity to contribute, grow, and lead. We see Outreachy as a vital
part of this. It helps:

&#42; Support underrepresented contributors &#42; Grow new long-term
community members &#42; Strengthen Fedora's diversity and mentorship
culture

## Outreachy interns {#_outreachy_interns}

We maintain a full list of Outreachy interns and their contributions in
our Mentored Projects documentation.

[View all Fedora Outreachy interns and their contributions
here.](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mentored-projects/outreachy/faq/)

(If you're curious about Outreachy? [Find out more and
apply](https://www.outreachy.org/). If you get in and work with Fedora,
you'll be on our list too.)

## How Fedora Mentors Interns {#_how_fedora_mentors_interns}

Fedora mentors follow a supportive, flexible approach:

&#42; Async support via Matrix and GitLab(any other active git forges we
use) &#42; Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins &#42; Clear tasks tracked in
GitLab Issues &#42; Encouragement to blog, present, and engage

Mentorship is about collaboration, learning, and helping interns grow
into confident, long-term contributors --- not just finishing tasks.

## Life beyond Outreachy {#_life_beyond_outreachy}

Outreachy doesn't stop when the internship ends. For many it's just the
beginning. Many Outreachy alums keep contributing, join SIGs, run
workshops, and even become speakers. This section highlights how the
journey continues, because the goal isn't just contribution but also
belonging.

&#42; &#42;Roseline Bassey (Outreachy 2024)&#42; had her talk ["Scaling
Fedora Ready Through Community
Contributions"](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/ED3YLJ/)
presented at Flock 2025 by Fedora Community Architect Justin Wheeler.
&#42; &#42;Nikita Tripathi (Outreachy 2022)&#42; gave a talk at Flock
2025 on ["Open Source Mentorship: Crafting Community
Leaders,"](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/JS9BHV/)
where she shared what mentorship is (and isn't), and why engagement and
support matter.

too"](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/why-i-got-selected-for-fedora-outreachy-and-what-might-help-you-too/155348)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) {#_frequently_asked_questions_faq}

Do I need to be a coder?

:   Nope! Fedora welcomes all kinds of skills --- writing, design,
    community organizing, QA, translation, and more. If you love open
    source and want to learn, there's a place for you.

Do I need to know Fedora already?

:   Not at all. Curiosity and effort matter more than deep technical
    knowledge. Many interns start from zero and grow fast by just asking
    questions and showing up.

I'm nervous --- what if I mess up?

:   You won't be alone. Fedora contributors are here to support you. You
    just need to try, be respectful, and learn from the process. Nobody
    expects perfection --- just progress.

What kind of projects can I work on?

:   Fedora offers technical and non-technical projects --- from
    packaging and automation to design, docs, community outreach, and
    research. Each project has mentors to guide you along the way.

Will I get mentorship support regularly?

:   Yes. Mentors are expected to communicate regularly --- through
    Matrix, email, GitLab, or scheduled check-ins --- to help you stay
    on track and feel supported throughout the internship.

# Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Advisor {#_fedora_diversity_equity_amp_inclusion_dei_advisor}

([*Return to \'Current Members of the Fedora
Council\'*](council:ROOT:members.xml))

The &#42;Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Advisor&#42; is
a liaison between the Fedora Council and the Fedora community on topics
and issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in Fedora. The
DEI Advisor works with Fedora Council leadership to represent
perspectives and voices of the Fedora community in decision-making and
project discussions. Additionally, they also lead initiatives to assess
and promote equity and inclusion in collaboration with the
[{team_name}](ROOT:index.xml).

## Current DEI Advisor {#current-advisor}

![Jona Azizaj (she/her)](https://jonatoni.fedorapeople.org/jona.png)

Jona is a community builder and Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS)
hacktivisit. She first started using Fedora Linux in 2014 when she was
introduced to Fedora at [Open Source Conference
Albania](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Conference_Albania)
(OSCAL). In 2015, she became a Fedora Project contributor. Later, she
served in various leadership roles in Fedora such as the late Fedora
Ambassador Steering Committee (FAmSCo) and the Fedora Council. She also
became the first Fedora Ambassador from Albania. Over the years, she has
participated in and led various other open source communities such as
LibreOffice and NextCloud. She is also a co-founder of the [Open Source
Diversity community](https://opensourcediversity.org/).

You can learn more about Jona [on her Fedora wiki
userpage]({FWIKI}/User:Jonatoni).

## Duration of service {#duration}

The DEI Advisor will serve until they wish to step down, or the Council
or the DEI Team wish to replace them. The recommendation for duration of
service is two Fedora release cycles, or &#42;one year&#42;. However,
terms may (xref:&#35;history\[and have\]) run shorter or longer
depending on the personal situation of the person filling the Advisor
role.

In the event that the DEI Advisor, Council, or DEI Team wish to make a
change in the Advisor, sufficient reason should be given. A new DEI
Advisor will then be xref:&#35;selection\[selected\] by the DEI Team.

## Responsibilities

The Fedora DEI Advisor is a liaison between the Fedora Council, the
Fedora DEI Team, and the Fedora community. The following
responsibilities and duties are delegated to the DEI Advisor.

### To Fedora Council {#responsibilities-council}

&#42; Participate in two to three Council hackfests a year
(xref:&#35;hackfest\[*what is a hackfest?*\]). &#42; Participate in two
to three Council meetings a month, as representative of the DEI Team.
&#42; Identify collaboration opportunities with Fedora Council
responsibilities, Fedora DEI Team objectives, and the Fedora community.
&#42; Optionally, serve as an [Executive
Sponsor](project::initiatives.adoc&#35;proposing-sponsors) of a Fedora
[Community Initiative](project::initiatives.xml).

#### Examples {#responsibilities-council-examples}

&#42; &#42;Council Hackfests&#42;: See the [February 2023 Council
hackfest
report](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/february-2023-council-hackfest-summary/).
[Fedora-Council/tickets&#35;331](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/331)
also shows an example of the planning for a hackfest. &#42; &#42;Council
meetings&#42;: Sometimes [in
text](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council_Meetings), sometimes [on
video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0x39xti0_64uSci6Wqk_E-IMSyq6vEuE).
&#42; &#42;Collaborations&#42;: See
[Fedora-Council/tickets&#35;306](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/306),
which discussed renaming the dist-git default branch from
&#96;master&#96; to &#96;main&#96;. This only represents one small part
of the (publicly archived) conversation, but there is more
behind-the-scenes work that involves talking to other members of the
Fedora community. Another example is
[Fedora-Council&#35;335](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/335),
which was a proposal for the [Fedora Community Outreach
Revamp]({FWIKI}/Objectives/CommunityOutreachRevamp). While not
explicitly a diversity, equity, and inclusion topic, there is an
opportunity for the DEI Advisor to share constructive feedback to
up-and-coming [Community Initiatives](project::initiatives.xml).

### To Fedora DEI Team {#responsibilities-team}

&#42; Participate in at least one DEI Team meeting (out of two) each
month. &#42;&#42; If the DEI Advisor cannot make one meeting, they will
provide updates asynchronously to the team or the Meeting Chair. &#42;
Share periodic updates and insight on Fedora Council tasks and
priorities back to the DEI teams. &#42; Maintain and update DEI team
documentation for any key objectives and the DEI Advisor role page.

#### Examples {#responsibilities-team-examples}

&#42; &#42;DEI Team meetings&#42;: [Held on Matrix and audio/video twice
monthly](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/diversity-team/). Also an
opportunity for the DEI Advisor to share any announcements or on-going
work in the Fedora Council back with the wider team. &#42;
&#42;Documentation&#42;: Help keep pages (like this one!) up-to-date in
the DEI Team documentation. &#42; &#42;Budget maintenance&#42;: This is
done with support from the [Fedora Community
Architect](council::fca.xml). Logistics of how this is updated varies
between DEI Advisors.

### To Fedora community {#responsibilities-community}

&#42; Listen to needs, concerns, and hopes of the Fedora community for
Fedora. &#42; Be an intersectional advocate for the diverse Fedora
community to Fedora leadership. &#42; Act as a source of support and/or
mediator in concerns or incidents. &#42; Make explicit invitations to
Fedora community events and provide financial support to do so when
needed. &#42; Promote inclusion in the Fedora community.

#### Examples {#responsibilities-community-examples}

There are fewer concrete examples of these responsibilities to the
Fedora community. Each DEI Advisor takes their own approach to these
responsibilities. It is also an opportunity for the DEI Advisor to take
a creative spin on the role. There is always room for new ideas and
approaches on how to best serve the needs of the Fedora community and
encourage inclusion across Fedora.

## Selection

This section explains how the DEI Advisor is nominated and confirmed.
The selection process documented below is initiated when a rotation of
Advisors is motioned by the existing DEI Advisor, the Fedora DEI Team,
or the Fedora Council.

### Nomination {#selection-nomination}

There will be a one-week nomination period for a potential DEI Advisor.
Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated by others with their
consent. A prospective nominee should understand the dynamics of the
Fedora DEI Team, a basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects,
and have sufficient time to perform the responsibilities required.
Nominees are required to be members of the Fedora DEI Team.

In the event that there are no nominees, the DEI Team will work with the
Council to broaden the search message and request more time. Should no
nominees be found after that, the role will rotate among existing DEI
Team members until the next DEI Advisor is identified.

### Confirmation {#selection-confirmation}

After the one-week nomination period expires, the Fedora DEI Team will
discuss candidates in a public meeting. In a meeting discussion, it
provides an opportunity for the team to weigh in and share other
context. In the event that more than two nominees are both interested in
the Advisor role, the Fedora DEI Team will coordinate with the [Fedora
Program Manager](council::fpgm.xml) to run an election.

For the Fedora Elections application, use these conditions:

&#42; Nominee must be a member of &#96;fedora-diversity&#96; FAS group
&#42; Voting is open to FPCA+1 voters (like Council elections)

The selected person and the Council will be notified once the selection
is confirmed. The selected person will begin serving as the DEI Advisor
to the Council as soon as possible.

## Appendix

Hackfest

:   A hackfest is a multi-day \'team sprint\' where Fedora contributors
    gather together to work towards one or two clear objectives or
    goals. Pre-COVID, teams could propose their own budgets for
    arranging travel, booking accommodations and a venue, and other
    support costs for bringing people together.
