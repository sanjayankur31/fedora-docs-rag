This document outlines the important activities you can get involved in
to help with [Fedora Quality](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA) and is
meant to guide you through the Quality ecosystem. It's easy to get
involved and we love to welcome people to the group! The first thing you
probably want to do is get plugged in to all the right sources of
information for Fedora Quality.

There are six steps you can take to get up to speed with Quality efforts
(in rough order of precedence):

- Create a [Fedora
  account](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts)

- Subscribe to the
  [test](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
  mailing list

- [Introduce
  yourself](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Join#self-introduction) to
  the team!

  Account](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi)

  [#quality:fedoraproject.org](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#quality:fedoraproject.org)
  Matrix room through [Fedora Chat](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/) (or
  [other clients](https://matrix.to/#/#quality:fedoraproject.org))

- Subscribe to the
  [quality-team](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/quality-team)
  tag at [Fedora Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/)

  call](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Join#onboarding-call)

# What are you looking to do? {#_what_are_you_looking_to_do}

Whether you are looking to test a [stable
release](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases), a new package from
[updates-testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing), a
[Branched](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Branched)
[pre-release](https://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease), or the leading
edge [Rawhide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide), QA has
a way for you to contribute and get involved! We need people who like to
push all the buttons, use all the command line options, verify all the
documentation, review things for usability, and suggest future
features - especially for anything that's undergone major
[change](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Policy) in a [recent or
pending](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes) release.

  - [Develop
    Tools](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Join#develop-tools)

  - [Triage Bugs](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Join#triage)

For all of those tasks, it would be good to have some familiarity with
our Bugzilla instance. A lot of contribution to Fedora Quality comes
through bug reports. All you need is a
[Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/) account: [create your
account](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi). Please make
sure that the email addresses for your Fedora account and the Bugzilla
account are the same. Our [bug reporting
practices](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsAndFeatureRequests)
provide some good background for filing bugs. If you want to discuss the
bugs before reporting, QA members can be found on [several
channels](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA#Communicate). Experienced
Quality members are more than happy to act as mentors for new members to
help them get started. There is no requirement of programming knowledge.
However, being familiar with Fedora and Linux in general will be
extremely useful.
