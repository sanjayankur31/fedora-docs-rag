Fedora Atomic Desktops can be installed in the same way as other Fedora variants, and the official Fedora installation guide can be followed for your Fedora version.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Fedora documentation site] for more details.

[[before-you-begin]]

As with installing any new operating system, it is important to back up any data that you want to save before starting, and have a clear understanding of the consequences of what you are doing.

Fedora Atomic Desktops are intended to provide the full range of capabilities that you would expect from an installation of Fedora.
However, there are some differences in terms of which applications can be installed, and how the operating system environment works.

It is therefore recommended that you read this user guide before deciding to install a Fedora Atomic Desktop.
It is also recommended that you determine whether a Fedora Atomic Desktop meets the specific needs or requirements that you might have.
If you are uncertain about this, a Fedora Atomic Desktop can also be tested in a virtual machine prior to installation.

[[known-limitations]]

*Dual booting and manual partitioning is not fully functional.*

It is possible to make Fedora Atomic Desktops work for both dual boot and manual partitioning, and some guidance is provided on manual partitioning below.
However, there are hazards involved in both cases, and you should only attempt to use these features if you have done the necessary research, and are confident that you can overcome any issues that you might encounter.

This issue is tracked in https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues/284[issue +#284+].

*Known issues for specific Fedora Atomic Desktop variants.*

For Fedora Kinoite, a list of currently known bugs, issues and missing features is compiled in https://pagure.io/fedora-kde/SIG/issue/112[issue +#112+] in the https://pagure.io/fedora-kde/SIG/issues?status=Open&order_key=last_updated&order=desc[KDE SIG tracker].

[[getting-atomic-desktop]]

If you are using Fedora Media Writer, the Fedora Atomic Desktops should be listed as a download option.
However, if it isn't, or if you want to download it manually, an install image can be downloaded from https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/[the main Fedora website].

See the individual download page for each Fedora Atomic Desktop variant:

* https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/download[Fedora Silverblue]
* https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/download[Fedora Kinoite]
* https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/sway/download[Fedora Sway Atomic]
* https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/budgie/download[Fedora Budgie Atomic]
* https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/cosmic/download[Fedora COSMIC Atomic]

Once you have got your copy of a Fedora Atomic Desktop, it can be installed in the usual manner.
We hope that you love it!

[[preparing-boot-media]]

Fedora installation images are *Hybrid ISOs* and can be used to create installation media with both optical and USB disks, for booting on both BIOS and UEFI systems.

We recommend using Fedora Media Writer to make a bootable USB media to install a Fedora Atomic Desktop.
Other USB media creation software may work as well but are not regularly tested.

See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media/#_fedora_media_writer[Fedora Media Writer] section to learn how to use it.


[[manual-partition]]

As described above, there are known issues with manual partitioning on Fedora Atomic Desktops, and it should be used with caution.
The following notes are intended as hints for those attempting it, and should not be treated as recommended practice.
Automatic partitioning is recommended.

With Fedora Atomic Desktops, only certain mounts can be manually specified as partitions.
These include:

* `/boot/efi` (for the UEFI boot loaders)
* `/boot`
* `/var`
* Subdirectories under `/var`, including:
** `/var/home` (there is a symlink from `/home` to `/var/home`)
** `/var/log`
** `/var/containers`
* The root filesystem: `/`

The Fedora installer is not aware of these restrictions and will accept custom partitions without error, even if they are incompatible with Fedora Atomic Desktops.

image::faw-manual-partition-complete.png[title="Partitioning Complete"]

The above screenshot shows a typical configuration with manual partitioning in UEFI firmware, with partitions for `/boot`, `/boot/efi`, `/`, and `/var/home`.

Manual partitioning on Fedora Atomic Desktops can be done with `BTRFS`, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29[LVM], as well as standard partitions or an `XFS` filesystem.

[IMPORTANT]
====
BTRFS filesystems smaller than 5 GiB should be formatted using `--mixed` (`-M`) flag.
Currently neither `mkfs.btrfs` nor Blivet does this automatically.
See https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mkfs.btrfs.html#mkfs-feature-mixed-bg[BTRFS documentation] for more details.
====

[[first-run]]


On first startup you will be asked to enable third-party repositories, location services, and to create a new user.
You can enable third-party repositories and location later, but you must create a new user by entering your desired name and password.

image::Fedora_40_new_user.png[title="Silverblue - Create New User"]

Once you have created the user you can start using your Fedora Silverblue system.


On first startup, you will be asked to enter the password for the user created during installation.
Depending on different personal needs, there are several starting actions and installations that you could perform on newly installed Fedora Kinoite for a customized user experience.

image::kinoite-first-run.png[title="Kinoite - Welcome Center"]


On first startup, you will be asked to enter the password for the user created during installation.
Then, you can start using Fedora Sway Atomic.

image::sway-atomic-first-run.png[title="Sway Atomic - First Run"]


On first startup, you will be asked to enter the password for the user created during installation.
Then, you can start using Fedora Budgie Atomic.

image::budgie-atomic-first-run.png[title="Budgie Atomic - First Run"]


Depending on different personal needs, there are several starting actions and installations that you could perform on a newly installed Fedora Atomic Desktop for a customized user experience.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are new to Fedora Atomic Desktops and before installing software in your newly installed system, you should read the xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] section to learn about the difference between *Flatpak*, *Toolbox* and *package layering* (rpm-ostree).
====

For some tips about Fedora Atomic Desktops, see the xref:tips-and-tricks.adoc[Tips and Tricks] section.
:experimental:

[[getting-started]]

Fedora Atomic Desktops are designed to be easy and straightforward to use, and specialist knowledge should generally not be required.
However, Fedora Atomic Desktops are built differently from other operating systems, and there are therefore some things that are useful to know.

Fedora Atomic Desktops have different options for installing software, compared with a standard Fedora installation (or other package-based Linux distributions).
These include:

* Flatpak apps: This is the primary way that (GUI) apps get installed on Fedora Atomic Desktops.
* Toolbx: Used primarily for CLI apps; development, debugging tools, etc., but also has support for graphical apps.
* Package layering: Most Fedora packages can be installed on the system with the help of package layering.
By default the system operates in pure image mode, but package layering is useful for things like libvirt, drivers, etc.

Although Flatpak is best suited for GUI apps, Toolbx for CLI apps and package layering for system-level packages, it's ultimately up to you to choose the method that best suits your needs.
There's nothing wrong in installing CLI apps with Flatpak, or GUI apps with Toolbx, or using package layering only.
Nevertheless, our examples stick to the aforementioned recommendations throughout this documentation.

For information on <<flatpak>> and <<package-layering,package layering>>, see below.

See the dedicated xref:toolbox.adoc[Toolbx] page to get started with it.

[[flatpak]]

Flatpak is the primary way that apps can be installed on Fedora Atomic Desktops.
For more information, see http://flatpak.org[Flatpak].
Flatpak and Flathub work out of the box in Fedora Atomic Desktops therefore Flathub nor Flatpak does not to be setup. Fedora provides a collection of apps that can be installed through Flatpak.

The other main source of Flatpak apps is https://flathub.org[Flathub], which provides a large repository of Flatpak apps that can be installed.

[[flathub-setup]]

[NOTE]
====
The following figures depict Flathub setup for Fedora Silverblue.
The steps may vary slightly depending on the Atomic Desktop variant, but the overall process should be similar.
====

To setup Flathub on Fedora Atomic Desktops, open the https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora[Flathub setup page for Fedora] and click the btn:[Flathub repository file] button to download the Flathub configuration.

image::sfg_flathub_fedora.png[title="Fedora quick setup page"]

A popup window will show a download option for the file.
The “Open with” option should show “Software Install (default)” or "Discover (default)".
Click on the btn:[OK] button to start the download.

image::sfg_flathub_download.png[title="Flathub download options"]

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub repository.
This window also shows the source location of the repository to be installed, under the "Details" heading *(1)*.
To start the installation of the Flathub repository, click on the btn:[Install] button *(2)*.

image::sfg_flathub_install.png[title="Flathub install window"]

After the repository installation process is complete, the window will be updated to show a btn:[Remove] button in place of the btn:[Install] button.

Alternatively, you can use the following command from the terminal:

[source]
----
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
----


Once the Flathub repository has been setup, it can be used to install Flatpak apps.
This can be done directly from the GNOME Software or the Plasma Discover applications, or apps can be browsed on the https://flathub.org[Flathub website].

If you choose to install apps from the Flathub website, clicking btn:[Install] will download a file which will be opened by the GNOME Software or Plasma Discover application, which can then be used to install the app.
For example, to install https://www.libreoffice.org[LibreOffice], you first search for and open the LibreOffice page, and then press the btn:[Install] button.

After clicking the btn:[Install] button, a download information window will be shown.
Verify the correct Flatpak has been downloaded and then click on the btn:[OK] button to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak download"]

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the GNOME Software or the Plasma Discover application will open a new window with an btn:[Install] button *(2)*.
Click this button to begin installation.

Alternatively, each application on Flathub can be installed through the terminal by running the installation command at the bottom of the page that should look something like this:

[source]
----
$ flatpak install flathub <package-name>
----

As an example, Firefox can be installed by running the following command which can be found on Firefox's flathub page:

[source]
----
$ flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
----


Additional details about the flatpak command line interface can be found in the official http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/using-flatpak.html[Flatpak documentation].

[[package-layering]]

Package layering works by modifying your Fedora Atomic Desktop installation.
As the name implies, it works by extending the packages from which the Fedora Atomic Desktop is composed.

Good examples of packages to be layered would be:

* `fish`: An alternative Unix shell
* `i3`: A X11 tiling compositor
* `libvirt`: The libvirt daemon

Most (but not all) RPM packages provided by Fedora can be installed on Fedora Atomic Desktops using this method.

Using package layering creates a new deployment, or bootable filesystem root.
It does not affect your current root.
This preserves rollback and the transactional model, but means that the system must be rebooted after a package has been layered or updated.
You can alternatively use `rpm-ostree install --apply-live <package-name>` to also temporarily apply the change directly to your currently booted deployment.
It's generally expected that you use package layering sparingly, and use <<flatpak>> and xref:toolbox.adoc[Toolbx] whenever possible.

Package layering is generally done from the command line.
However, the GNOME Software or the Plasma Discover application does rely on it for installing a small number of apps that are currently difficult to install as Flatpaks.


Packages can be installed on Fedora Atomic Desktops using:

[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree install <package-name>
----

This will download the package and any required dependencies, and recompose your Fedora Atomic Desktop image with them.
`rpm-ostree` uses standard Fedora package names, which can be searched with `rpm-ostree search` since Fedora Atomic Desktops 39, or using DNF inside a xref:toolbox.adoc[Toolbx] for previous versions.

Once a package has been installed in this manner, it will be kept up-to-date as new versions are released and as the base operating system is updated.

By default, `rpm-ostree` will download both required and recommended dependencies of layered packages.
If you want dependency resolver to stick to required dependencies only, then you have to append

[source]
----
Recommends=false
----

line to the `/etc/rpm-ostreed.conf` file.
There's no ad-hoc CLI flag to do so because of how `rpm-ostree` works internally.


In some scenarios, you may want to test out a new version of `podman` or `kernel` or other packages that live on the host.
The `rpm-ostree override` command can be used to replace a package with a different version.
You can download the package locally and run:

[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree override replace <path/to/package>
----

Or you can override packages without downloading using links from Koji or Bodhi.
For example:

[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree override replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/5.7.0/1.fc43/x86_64/podman-5.7.0-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm
----

You may also use `rpm-ostree override remove` to effectively "hide" packages.
They will still exist in the underlying base layer, but will not appear in the booted root.

Removing and replacing packages using package layering is not generally recommended.
For more information, see the https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/[rpm-ostree documentation].


See xref:troubleshooting.adoc#_adding_external_package_repositories[Adding external package repositories].
[[updates-upgrades-rollbacks]]

Installing updates on Fedora Atomic Desktops is easy and fast.
It also has a special rollback feature, in case anything goes wrong.
Additionally, you can choose to have multiple versions of your operating system installed at all times, and you can choose which one to boot into whenever you start up your system.

[[updating]]

OS updates are fully integrated into the desktop; you will be automatically notified when an update is available.
On Silverblue and Kinoite, updates are automatically downloaded.
This behavior can be changed in the settings.
On Sway Atomic, Budgie Atomic and COSMIC Atomic, updates need to be manually applied.

Once an update is ready, it is just a matter of rebooting to start using the new version.
There is no waiting for the update to be installed during this reboot.

If you'd prefer, it is also possible to update using the command line.
To do this, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree upgrade
----

This will check for new updates and download and install them if they are available.
Alternatively, to check for available updates without downloading them, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree upgrade --check
----

[[upgrading]]

Upgrading between major versions (such as from Fedora {version-oldstable} to Fedora {version-stable}) can be completed using GNOME Software on Silverblue, Plasma Discover on Kinoite and Budgie Atomic.
Alternatively, Fedora Atomic Desktops can be upgraded between major versions using the `rpm-ostree` command.

[WARNING]
====
Skipping major releases is currently untested and is thus not supported.
You should update only one major release at a time, i.e. from Fedora {version-oldstable} to {version-stable}, etc.
====

First, make sure that you are running the latest update for the current version:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree upgrade
----

Reboot your system if needed.
Then, verify that the branch for the next major version is available.
You can print all available branches for the Fedora Atomic Desktop variant that you are currently using with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ source /etc/os-release
$ ostree remote refs ${ID} | grep $(arch) | grep ${VARIANT_ID}
----

After you've verified the name of your branch, you are ready to proceed.
For example, to upgrade to Fedora Silverblue {version-stable}, the command is:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/{version-stable}/x86_64/silverblue
----

The old variant name for Sway Atomic is `sericea` and for Budgie Atomic it is `onyx`.

The process is very similar to a system update: the new OS is downloaded and installed in the background, and you just boot into it when it is ready.

NOTE: If you are using the RPM Fusion repositories and are having issues during major updates, see the xref:tips-and-tricks.adoc#_enabling_rpm_fusion_repos[Enabling RPM Fusion repos] section.

[[rebasing]]

Additionally, you can choose to rebase to a different variant of Fedora Atomic.
For example, if you are currently using Silverblue, you can switch to Kinoite.
Fedora Kinoite is similar to Fedora Silverblue, except for the fact that it uses the KDE Plasma desktop instead of the GNOME desktop.

What this means is, you can rebase to Fedora Kinoite to try it out, without ever touching your current system.
Because the two system images are isolated from each other, the two desktop environments will never be installed at the same time.
All your flatpak apps and files in the `/home` directory will remain persistent between rebases.
Same applies for testing out the development version of Fedora Atomic Desktops, which is Rawhide.

[NOTE]
====
By default, OSTree only keeps the two most recent deployments.
If you decide to rebase, make sure to xref:pinning-and-cleaning-deployments[pin your current deployment], so you don't accidentally lose it.
====

[[rolling-back]]

Fedora Atomic Desktops keep a record of the previous OS version, which can be switched to instead of the latest version.
While this shouldn't usually be necessary, it can be helpful if there is a problem with an update or an upgrade (rollbacks work the same way for both), as well as for development purposes.

There are two ways to roll back to the previous version:

. Temporary rollbacks: to temporarily roll back to a previous version, simply reboot and select the previous version from the boot menu (often known as the GRUB menu).
. Permanent rollbacks: to permanently switch back to the previous deployment, use the `rpm-ostree rollback` command.

After rolling back, you will technically be on an old OS version, and may be prompted to update.
Updating will undo the rollback, so it should be avoided if you want the rollback to stay in effect.

`rpm-ostree` only keeps one rollback version available by default.
If you want to rollback to another version than the one currently available on your system, you can do so with the following commands:

. Pull the ostree commit log from the remote repository:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ source /etc/os-release
$ sudo ostree pull --commit-metadata-only --depth=10 $\{ID\} $\{ID\}/{version-stable}/$(arch)/$\{VARIANT_ID\}
----

. Display the log:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ ostree log $\{ID\}:$\{ID\}/{version-stable}/$(arch)/$\{VARIANT_ID\}
----

. Deploy a specific commit:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ rpm-ostree deploy {version-stable}.20251031.0
----

NOTE: This will deploy the exact version as requested and will not include overlayed packages and other changes.

[[pinning-and-cleaning-deployments]]

By default, the `rpm-ostree upgrade` or `rpm-ostree rebase` commands will keep at most two bootable deployments, though the underlying technology supports more.
In some cases, such as a major version upgrade or rebase, you may want to keep your current deployment as a guaranteed fallback.
OSTree allows you to pin deployments.
Pinning ensures that your deployment of choice is kept and not discarded.
To pin an deployment, you need to know its index number.
To print the index numbers of the deployments, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree status --verbose
----

If you want to pin your currently booted deployment, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0
----

If you pin many deployments, the `/boot` partition may run out of space and as a consequence the system may not be able to be upgraded.
In such cases, it is necessary to unpin and clean up some deployments.
To unpin a deployment, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ostree admin pin INDEX --unpin
----

You can run the above command multiple times to free up more space.
Then clean up unpinned deployments:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree cleanup --rollback
----

NOTE: The `rpm-ostree cleanup --rollback` command will not remove pinned deployments.
:experimental:

[[toolbox]]

NOTE: Toolbx is not a typo, see the https://containertoolbx.org[project page].

Fedora Atomic Desktops are an excellent platform for container-based development and, for working with containers, https://buildah.io[buildah] and https://podman.io[podman] are recommended.

Fedora Atomic Desktops also comes with the https://github.com/containers/toolbox[toolbx] utility, which uses containers to provide an environment where development tools and libraries can be installed and used.

[[toolbox-why-use]]

Toolbx makes it easy to use a containerized environment for everyday software development and debugging.
On operating systems utilizing read-only root filesystems, like https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops[Fedora Atomic Desktops], it provides a familiar package-based environment in which tools and libraries can be installed and used.
However, toolbx can also be used on package-based systems.

Using Toolbx for running your workflows in a containerized manner brings you several advantages:

* It keeps the host OS clean and stable, and helps to avoid the clutter that can happen after installing lots of development tools and packages.
* You get access to different versions of supported distributions independent of the version you are running.
* Containers are a good way to isolate and organise the dependencies needed for different projects.
* Containers are a safe space to experiment: if things go wrong, it's easy to throw a toolbox away and start again.

However, it is very important to note that toolbx containers are still integrated with your host system, so you should not attempt to do things or run software you otherwise wouldn't on your host system. Toolbx containers are not completely isolated environments like virtual machines.

[[toolbox-how-it-works]]

Toolbx takes the work out of using containers, by providing a small number of simple commands to create, enter, list and remove containers.
It also integrates toolbx containers into your regular working environment, to make it easy for you to use them as an everyday development space.

Containers are created from images and those are usually a very stripped down version of distributions.
In such images there are almost no tools and documentation available.
The team behind Toolbx maintains a Fedora image where such tools and documentation are available, providing a good out of the box experience.

Each toolbx container is an environment that you can enter from the command line.
Inside each one, you will find:

* Your existing username and permissions.
* Access to your home directory and several other locations.
* Access to both system and session D-Bus, system journal and Kerberos.
* Common command lines tools, including a package manager (e.g., DNF on Fedora).

In other words, toolbx containers look, feel and behave like a standard Linux command line environment.
By connecting all this information, toolbx containers lose a certain amount of security gained by using the containers technology.
Therefore, you should not treat toolbx containers as a sandbox where you can execute any script you would never run on any other system.

In most cases, when a command is run inside a container, the program from inside the container is used.
However, there are a few special cases where the program on the host is used instead (using `flatpak-spawn`).
One example of this is the `toolbox` command itself; this makes it possible to use toolbx from inside toolbx containers.

[[toolbox-installation]]


Toolbx is preinstalled on Fedora Atomic Desktops.


Toolbx can be installed on other Fedora Editions (or any package-based version of Fedora) with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo dnf install toolbox
----

[[toolbox-first-toolbox]]

Once toolbx is installed, two simple commands are required to get started:

[source,bash]
----
$ toolbox create
----

This will download an OCI image and create a toolbx container from it.
Once this is complete, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ toolbox enter
----

Once inside the toolbox, you can access common command line tools, and install new ones using a package manager (e.g., DNF on Fedora).

[NOTE]
====
When the prompt is inside a toolbox, it is prepended with a diamond: this indicates that the prompt is inside a toolbx container.
The diamond symbol may not be present if you use a custom shell theme.
====

[[toolbox-commands]]

[[toolbox-create]]

Creates a toolbx container.
This will download an OCI image if one isn't available (this is required to create the container).
By default an image matching the version of the host is used.
If the host system does not have a matching image, a Fedora image is used instead.

Used without options, `toolbox create` will automatically name the container it creates.
To create additional toolboxes, use the `<name>` argument.

To use a specific version of the host system (e.g., Fedora {version-oldstable} on Fedora {version-stable}), use the `--release <release> | -r <release>` option.

To use a different distribution to create a toolbx container (e.g., RHEL on Fedora), use the `--distro <distro> | -d <distro>` option.

To use a different image, use the ``--image <name> | -i <name>`` option.

[[toolbox-enter]]

Enters a toolbox for interactive use.
Used without options, `toolbox enter` opens the default toolbox.

To enter a toolbox with specific name, use the `name` argument.

To enter a toolbox for a different distribution (e.g., Fedora on RHEL), use the `--distro <distro> |-d <distro>` option.

To enter a toolbox with specific version (e.g., RHEL 9.6 on RHEL 10.0), use the `--release <release> | -r <release>` option.

[[toolbox-run]]

Runs a command in a toolbox without entering it.
Used without options, `toolbox run` runs the command in the default toolbox.

To run a command in a toolbox with specific name, use the `--container <name> | -c <name>` option.

To run a command in a toolbox for a different distribution (e.g., Fedora on RHEL), use the `--distro <distro> |-d <distro>` option.

To run a command in a toolbox with specific version (e.g., RHEL 9.6 on RHEL 10.0), use the `--release <release> | -r <release>` option.

[[toolbox-list]]

Lists local toolbx images and containers.

To only show containers, use the `--containers | -c` option.

To only show images, use the `--images | -i` option.

[[toolbox-rm]]

Removes one or more toolbx containers.

The `--force | -f` option removes the marked containers even if they are running.

The `--all | -a` option removes all toolbx containers.

[[toolbox-rmi]]

Removes one or more toolbx images.

The `--force | -f` option removes the marked images and all containers that have been created using the marked images.

The `--all | -a` option removes all toolbx images.

[[toolbox-help]]

Shows Toolbx's manual page.

[[toolbox-exiting]]

To return to the host environment, either run `exit` or quit the current shell (typically kbd:[Ctrl+D]).

[[toolbox-under-the-hood]]

Toolbx uses the following technologies:

* https://www.opencontainers.org[OCI container images]
* https://podman.io[Podman]

[[toolbox-contact]]

To report issues, make suggestions, or contribute fixes, see https://github.com/containers/toolbox[toolbx's GitHub project].

To get in touch with toolbx users and developers, use the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/toolbx[Fedora Discussion], or join the https://matrix.to/#/#toolbx:matrix.org[Toolbx Matrix Room].
[technical-information]

This page provides some background technical information on Fedora Atomic Desktops, including information on the core technologies used to build it, as well as the filesystem layout.

Users should not need to know this information.
It is provided here for those who are interested in the technical details or those who want to use Fedora Atomic Desktops in a non-standard manner.

[[ostree-rpm-ostree]]

https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/[ostree] is the core technology that is used to compose, deploy and update Fedora Atomic Desktops.
ostree operates in a similar manner to a version control system, but it operates on entire filesystem trees.
It is often described as “Git for operating system binaries”.

For Fedora Atomic Desktops installations, ostree is responsible for deploying and updating the OS image (including everything below `/` that is not symlinked into `/var`).
It also updates `grub.cfg` entries to point to the current image.

https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/[rpm-ostree] builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install RPMs as a “layer” on top of an ostree image.
This makes it possible to install RPMs on Fedora Atomic Desktops.

When a package is installed with `rpm-ostree`, a new OS image is composed by adding the RPM payload to the existing OS image, and creating a new, combined image.
To see the newly installed RPMs, the system needs to be rebooted with the new image.
rpm-ostree also takes care of recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.

[[filesystem-layout]]

On Fedora Atomic Desktops, the root filesystem (`/`) is mounted read-only.
The `/usr` directory and everything below it is also read-only.

The `/etc` and `/var` directories are respectively used to store configuration files and runtime state and are thus writable.
Symlinks are used to make traditional state-carrying directories available in their expected locations.
This includes:

* `/home` → `/var/home`
* `/opt` → `/var/opt`
* `/srv` → `/var/srv`
* `/root` → `/var/roothome`
* `/usr/local` → `/var/usrlocal`
* `/mnt`→ `/var/mnt`
* `/tmp` → `/sysroot/tmp`

This means that separate home partitions should be mounted on `/var/home`.

Since Fedora Linux 37, the `/sysroot` directory is also https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Silverblue_Kinoite_readonly_sysroot[mounted read-only].

The `/boot` and `/boot/efi` directories are currently also mounted as writable but there are plans to mount them read-only in the future or even not mount them at all.
See https://gitlab.com/fedora/ostree/sig/-/issues/21[Mount /boot as Read Only by default] and https://gitlab.com/fedora/ostree/sig/-/issues/22[Do not mount /boot/efi by default].

:experimental:


Fedora Atomic Desktops use a new way of deploying and managing your desktop operating system, so you may occasionally run into problems while going through your day to day.
Below are some of the more common problems reported and any workarounds for those problems.


This can happen when a package that is being layered has a dependency on a package that is in the base OS.
In the problematic case, the layered package requires a newer version of the dependent package which is not available in the base OS.

In most cases, waiting for a newer OSTree compose will resolve this problem.
The dependent package will be updated in the compose and the package that was going to be layered will be successful.

However, if you continue to encounter this problem with a newer compose, you can try to cleanup the metadata with `rpm-ostree cleanup -m` and then retrying the `rpm-ostree install`.

Alternatively, you can try rebasing to any `updates` ref, like `fedora/{version-stable}/updates/x86_64` after the `cleanup` operation.

For more information, see https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/415[rpm-ostree#415].


Installing into `/opt` was commonly raised as a problem when users where trying to install Google Chrome.
A https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/1795[partial solution] has been implemented that allows users to layer Google Chrome, however it is not a complete solution for applications that write mutable data to `/opt`.

This issue is tracked in https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/233[rpm-ostree#233].


[NOTE]
====
The https://universal-blue.org/[Universal Blue] project creates operating system images with the NVIDIA drivers included.
The Universal Blue images are based on the Fedora Atomic Desktop images with additional changes at their discretion.
The Universal Blue images are not officially endorsed by the Fedora Project.
Use them at your own discretion.
====

You can install the official NVIDIA binary drivers from the RPM Fusion repositories.

CAUTION: The NVIDIA binary drivers are not maintained by the Fedora Project and may sometimes not be available for the kernel version included in Fedora Atomic Desktops.

. First, ensure that your system is fully updated by running `sudo rpm-ostree upgrade` and rebooting.

. Then setup the RPM Fusion repositories following the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/#_enabling_the_rpm_fusion_repositories_for_ostree_based_systems[documentation], including the two reboots.

. Finally, install the drivers:
+
[source]
----
# rpm-ostree install kmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia
# rpm-ostree kargs --append=rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau,nova-core \
--append=modprobe.blacklist=nouveau,nova-core \
--append=nvidia-drm.modeset=1 \
--append=initcall_blacklist=simpledrm_platform_driver_init
# systemctl reboot
----

[NOTE]
====
When using Secure Boot, the locally installed NVIDIA drivers have to be signed with a local key that is enrolled using `mokutil`.
See the https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues/499[fedora-silverblue#499] issue for more details.
====

You may also encounter the following issues during installation: https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues/286[#286], https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues/331[#331]

Thanks to https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/[Alex Larsson] who made the required changes to the `akmods` and `kmodtools` packages.
You can read more about the work that Alex did on his https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2019/03/06/nvidia-drivers-in-fedora-silverblue/[blog].


Fedora Atomic Desktops currently do not have support for DKMS.
See the upstream issue https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/1091[rpm-ostree#1091].

Instead, we recommend that you make https://rpmfusion.org/Packaging/KernelModules/Kmods2[kmods] packages for out of tree kernel modules and submit them to the https://rpmfusion.org/[RPM Fusion] repos.
The kmods packages will then be used by https://rpmfusion.org/Packaging/KernelModules/Akmods[akmods] which is supported on Fedora Atomic Desktops.


[CAUTION]
====
This section discusses third-party software sources not officially affiliated with or endorsed by the Fedora Project.
Use them at your own discretion.
====

NOTE: If you want to use RPM Fusion repositories, please follow the xref:tips-and-tricks.adoc#_enabling_rpm_fusion_repos[Enabling RPM Fusion repos] section.

Some sofware may only be available from a third-party repository.
You can add an external repository manually on Fedora Atomic Desktops by placing the `.repo` file into `/etc/yum.repos.d/` and the GPG key into `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`.
The following is a full example for setting up the Taiscale repo:

. Fetch and install the repo config:
+
[source]
----
$ curl -O https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/tailscale.repo
[tailscale-stable]
name=Tailscale stable
baseurl=https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/$basearch
enabled=1
type=rpm
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/repo.gpg
$ sudo install -o 0 -g 0 -m644 tailscale.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/tailscale.repo
----

. Fetch and install the GPG keys:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -O https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/repo.gpg
$ sudo install -o 0 -g 0 -m644 repo.gpg /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/tailscale.gpg
----

. Replace the `gpgkey=` URL in the repo config by the path the GPG keys:
+
[source]
----
$ sudoedit /etc/yum.repos.d/tailscale.repo
$ cat /etc/yum.repos.d/tailscale.repo
[tailscale-stable]
name=Tailscale stable
baseurl=https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/$basearch
enabled=1
type=rpm
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
### Update this line
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/tailscale.gpg
###    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----

. Install the new packages with:
+
[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree install tailscale
----

Better support in `rpm-ostree` for this use case is tracked in https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/4014[rpm-ostree#4014].


As users work with Fedora Atomic Desktops day-to-day, it is possible that they have modified the default SELinux policy in an effort to workaround one or more problems related to SELinux.
This is usually done when a user sees a SELinux denial in the journal.
If this is the case and one wishes to revert back to the default SELinux policy, you can try these set of actions.

. Check the state of the SELinux policy
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep policy
M    selinux/targeted/active/policy.linked
M    selinux/targeted/active/policy.kern
M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.31
A    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30
----
+
If anything is returned by this command, then your SELinux policy has been modified from the default.
+

. Copy the default SELinux policy shipped in the OSTree compose
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo cp -al /etc/selinux{,.bak}
$ sudo rsync -rlv /usr/etc/selinux/ /etc/selinux/
----
+
After doing this, the output from `ostree admin config-diff | grep policy` should no longer indicate the policy is modified.
+
If your policy still appears to be modified, you can try the following approach.

. Remove the SELinux policy; copy in the default policy
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/selinux
$ sudo cp -aT /usr/etc/selinux /etc/selinux
----
+
After this, the `ostree admin config-diff | grep policy` command should return no modifications.


Due to how `rpm-ostree` handles user + group entries, it may not be possible to use `usermod -a -G` to add a user to a group successfully.
Until `rpm-ostree` moves to using `systemd sysusers`, users will have to populate the `/etc/group` file from the `/usr/lib/group` file before they can add themselves to the group.

For example, if you wanted to add a user to the `libvirt` group:
[source,bash]
----
$ grep -E '^libvirt:' /usr/lib/group | sudo tee -a /etc/group
$ sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
----

NOTE: You will need to log off and log back in to apply these changes.

This issue is tracked in https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/29[rpm-ostree#29] and https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/49[rpm-ostree#49].


It is possible to end up in a situation where one or more files on the disk have become corrupted or missing.
In this case, `ostree fsck` will report errors in certain commits.
The https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/345#issuecomment-262263824[workaround] in this case is to mark the entire OSTree commit as partially retrieved and then re-pull the commit.


This issue is most commonly seen when users have installed Fedora Atomic Desktops on Apple hardware.
The `/boot/efi` partition on Apple hardware is formatted as HFS+ and is not always resilient to power failures or other kinds of hard power events.

Since Fedora Atomic Desktops now includes the `hfsplus-tools` package in the base compose, it has become relatively easy for users to workaround this kind of error.

[source]
----
# umount /boot/efi
# fsck.hfsplus /dev/sda1
# mount -o rw /boot/efi
----

See the https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/1380[rpm-ostree#1380] GitHub issue for additional details.


Users have reported that they cannot install a Fedora Atomic Desktop on an EFI based system where they previously had another OS installed.
The error that is often observed looks like:

[source]
----
ostree ['admin', '--sysroot=/mnt/sysimage', 'deploy', '--os=fedora-workstation', 'fedora-workstation:fedora/28/x86_64/workstation'] exited with code -6`
----

A couple of possible workarounds exist:

* During the install process, select "Custom Partitioning" and create an additional EFI partition.
Assign the newly created EFI partition to `/boot/efi`.
You will then be able to boot the previous OS(s) alongside your Fedora Atomic Desktop.
If this workaround is not successful follow the below step.

* Reformat the EFI partition on the host during the install process.
This can be done by selecting "Custom Partitioning" and checking the `Reformat` box when creating the `/boot/efi` partition.

[WARNING]
====
Choosing to reformat `/boot/efi` will likely result in the inability to boot any other operating systems that were previously installed.
Be sure that you have backed up any important data before using this workaround.
====

This issue is tracked in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575957[Bugzilla#1575957].


[IMPORTANT]
====
As of `podman` version `1.4.0` this workaround is not necessary.
Ensure `podman` is up to date by issuing `rpm-ostree upgrade` before attempting this workaround.
====

When issuing the `toolbox list` command, systems using `podman` versions newer than `1.2.0`, will generate the following error:

[source,bash]
----
toolbox: failed to list images with com.redhat.component=fedora-toolbox
----

[TIP]
====
The following workaround might be useful for other `toolbox` errors caused by `podman` versions greater than `1.2.0`.
See https://github.com/containers/toolbox/issues/169#issuecomment-495193902[toolbox#169].
====

As a workaround, it is possible to override `podman` packages newer than version `1.2.0` by issuing:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree override --remove=podman-manpages \
replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/1.2.0/2.git3bd528e.fc30/x86_64/podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm
----

Reboot the system to apply the changes.

For reference, it is also possible to override the package by following these steps:

. Download `podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm` from https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/1.2.0/2.git3bd528e.fc30/x86_64/podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm[Koji].
. Remove `podman-manpages` issuing: `rpm-ostree override remove podman-manpages`.
. Override the currently installed `podman` package (using the package you have downloaded on the first step) by:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree override replace podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm
----

You can now reboot the system for the change to take effect.

To revert this workaround issue the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree override reset podman
$ rpm-ostree override reset podman-manpages
----


With certain versions of `podman`, trying to enter a toolbox will result in errors.
You can fix this by resetting the permissions on the overlay-containers with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/containers/storage/overlay-containers
----

This will reset the permissions on your containers and allow you to enter them again.

See the upstream podman issue: https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/3187[podman#3187].


[WARNING]
====
You should never run `restorecon` on a Fedora Atomic Desktop system.
See the following bug for details - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1259018[Bugzilla#1259018]
====

However, if you happened to do this, it is possible to recover.

. Boot with `enforcing=0` on the kernel command line
. Create a new, "fixed" commit locally
. Deploy the new "fixed" commit
. Run `restorecon`
. Reboot
. Cleanup

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ rpm-ostree status -b | grep BaseCommit
BaseCommit: 696991d589980aeaef5eda352dd7ad3d33c444c789c209f793a84bc6e7269aee
### If the above command does not display any output, try:
$ rpm-ostree status -b | grep Commit
Commit: 696991d589980aeaef5eda352dd7ad3d33c444c789c209f793a84bc6e7269aee

$ sudo ostree fsck --delete
$ sudo ostree commit --consume \
--link-checkout-speedup --orphan --selinux-policy=/ /ostree/repo/tmp/selinux-fix
$ sudo restorecon -Rv /var
$ sudo restorecon -Rv /etc
### In the command below, substitute:
### - x86_64 with your actual CPU architecture
### - silverblue with the name for your Fedora Atomic Desktop variant
$ sudo ostree admin deploy fedora:fedora/{version-stable}/x86_64/silverblue
$ sudo reboot
----

The caveat to this recovery is that your layered packages will be removed; you'll need to relayer them after the recovery.

See this upstream comment for additional details: https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/issues/1265#issuecomment-484557615[ostree#1265].


In the case where you are unable to remember your user password or root password, you can reset the password using the following steps:

. While the system is booting, interrupt the boot sequence at the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/grub2-bootloader/[GRUB2] menu by using the kbd:[Esc] key.
. Select the boot entry that you wish to edit using the arrow keys.
. Edit the selected entry with the kbd:[e] key.
. Use the arrow keys to select the line beginning with `linux`, `linux16`, or `linuxefi`.
. Go to the end of that line (by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[e]) and append `init=/bin/bash`.
. Press kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[x] or kbd:[F10] to boot the entry.
. At the resulting `bash` prompt, run the following commands:

[source]
----
# mount -t selinuxfs selinuxfs /sys/fs/selinux
# /sbin/load_policy
# passwd
# sync
# /sbin/reboot -ff
----

If you want to change the password for a user account, replace the `passwd` command with `passwd <username>`.

After the system finishes rebooting, you should be able to login with the username and new password.



Team Silverblue was the name used to refer to the overall project.
Fedora Silverblue will be used for the OS, but calling it Silverblue in its short version is fine as well.


Our favorite choice for a project name was Silverleaf, but that sadly did not work out.
We just couldn't quite let go of the leaf.
You could also say that Silverblue is a new leaf on Fedora's OSTree.
😀


GNOME OS was a codename that was used by the upstream GNOME project for a while to refer to the idea of designing the entire desktop user experience.
By contrast, Silverblue is an effort inside the Fedora project, and will be built with existing Fedora technologies.
However, the two efforts do share a desire to deliver a user experience that is polished and coherent.


We chose the Kinoite name for the following reasons:

* KDE based projects traditionally start with a "K".
* Kinoite is a blue mineral (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoite[Wikipedia]), thus referring to both the "silver" and "blue" part of Silverblue and the blue color of the KDE logo.
* "Kinoite" means "There is a tree" in Japanese (https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=kinoite&op=translate[Google Translate]), thus referring to the "tree" in "ostree".


Fedora Atomic Desktops use the same core technology as Fedora IoT and Fedora CoreOS.
However, Fedora Atomic Desktops are specifically focused on workstation and desktop use cases with the GNOME, KDE Plasma, Sway, Budgie and COSMIC desktops.



Firefox is included in the OS image for now (see https://gitlab.com/fedora/ostree/sig/-/issues/3[issue#3] for progress on moving to Flatpak by default).
Until that changes, getting it to play videos works the same way as it does for the regular package mode Fedora: find a package with the needed codecs, and install it.
The one difference is that you use `rpm-ostree install` instead of `dnf install`.
An alternative solution is to install https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.mozilla.firefox[Firefox from Flathub].


`/etc` is not part of the read-only root filesystem, so you can just copy files into `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` (or let NetworkManager store them there when you recreate your connections).
Certificates in `/etc/pki` need to be handled similarly.


You can install most IDE directly in a toolbox where you can also install all the developments tools from the Fedora repositories.
To be able to launch them directly from menus, you can copy the `.desktop` file for the IDE from the toolbox to your home directory in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
You should then update the `Exec` line in the `.desktop` file to prepend `toolbox run` to start it from the toolbox.
You can also use the IDEs packaged as Flatpaks from Flathub.


* If you want to compare the booted deployment with the pending deployment (or rollback deployment), simply issue:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree db diff
----

+
TIP: You can also see the RPM changelog by adding the `-c` option like so: `rpm-ostree db diff -c`.

* If you want to see which packages were updated between two specific commits:

. Find out which two commits you want to compare by issuing:
+
[source]
----
$ ostree log <ref>
----

. You can now compare the two commits by issuing:
+
[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree db diff <commit x> <commit y>
----


You can simply use:
[source]
----
$ rpm -q <package>
----


To search for packages in your enabled repositories, use:
[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree search <package>
----


If, for whatever reason, you need to downgrade the kernel, you can do so by following these steps:

. For the version you need to downgrade, download `<kernel>`, `<kernel-core>`, `<kernel-modules>`, `<kernel-modules-core>` and `<kernel-modules-extra>` from https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8[Koji].

. Install the packages downloaded on the previous step by issuing:
+
[source]
----
$ rpm-ostree override replace <kernel> <kernel-core> <kernel-modules> <kernel-modules-core> <kernel-modules-extra>
----

. Reboot the system to apply the changes.

[[pinning]]

OSTree allows you to pin deployments (pinning ensures that your deployment of choice is kept and not discarded).

. Assuming that you want to keep your default deployment, issue the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ostree admin pin 0
----

+
NOTE: `0` here refers to the first deployment listed by `rpm-ostree status`

. Verify that you have pinned your deployment of choice by issuing:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ rpm-ostree status
----

. After the deployment is pinned, you can upgrade your system by using the instructions found xref:updates-upgrades-rollbacks.adoc#upgrading[here].

. When you have completed rebasing, reboot the system.
The GRUB menu will now present you with both: the previous deployment major version entry (e.g.: *"Fedora {version-oldstable}.YYYYMMDD.n"*) and the new deployment major version entry (e.g.: *"Fedora {version-stable}.YYYYMMDD.n"*).

+
NOTE: At the moment it is not possible to name (pinned) deployments and their associated GRUB menu entries.


If you're using another browser than the one installed by default (Firefox) then you can hide the default one from the interface via the following commands:

[source]
----
$ sudo cp /usr/share/applications/org.mozilla.firefox.desktop /usr/local/share/applications/
$ sudo sed -i "2a\\NotShowIn=GNOME;KDE" /usr/local/share/applications/org.mozilla.firefox.desktop
$ sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications/
----


If you want to make the default browser (Firefox) visible again after hiding it, you can follow these steps:

[source]
----
$ sudo rm -f /usr/local/share/applications/*firefox*.desktop
$ sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications
----


[CAUTION]
====
This section discusses third-party software sources not officially affiliated with or endorsed by the Fedora Project.
Use them at your own discretion.
Fedora recommends the use of free and open source software and avoidance of software encumbered by patents.
====

Users may want to take advantage of the non-free software that is made available via the https://rpmfusion.org/[RPM Fusion] repos in order to use the proprietary NVIDIA drivers, multimedia codecs, or other software not distributed as part of Fedora.


The first time you install the RPM Fusion repos, you need to install the versioned RPMs:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo rpm-ostree install \
https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm \
https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
$ reboot
----

Then continue with the next section to prepare your system for major Fedora updates.


Once you have rebooted into the new deployment, you can run the following command to remove the “lock” on the versioned packages that were installed previously.
This will enable the RPM Fusion repos to be automatically updated and versioned correctly across major Fedora version rebases:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo rpm-ostree update \
--uninstall rpmfusion-free-release \
--uninstall rpmfusion-nonfree-release \
--install rpmfusion-free-release \
--install rpmfusion-nonfree-release
$ reboot
----

If you frequently make use of Toolbx to perform various tasks and use multiple Toolbx containers it can be hard to keep track of whether you are currently executing commands on the host or in a Toolbx container.
Furthermore, there is currently no command to tell you in which Toolbx container you are working.

To alleviate this, you can add the following shell alias at the end of your `~/.bashrc`:

[source,bash]
----
alias istoolbx='[ -f "/run/.toolboxenv" ] && grep -oP "(?<=name=\")[^\";]+" /run/.containerenv'
----

When you open a new shell, you now have access to the new command `istoolbx`.
This will behave as follows:

* When run from the host, returns an exit code of 1.
* When run from a Toolbx container, returns an exit code of 0 and prints the current Toolbx containers name to the console.

If a more automated solution is your preference the following added to your `~/.bashrc` will change your bash prompt to include "[toolbox <name>]":

[source,bash]
----
function is_toolbox() {
if [ -f "/run/.toolboxenv" ]
then
TOOLBOX_NAME=$(cat /run/.containerenv | grep -oP "(?<=name=\")[^\";]+")
echo "[${HOSTNAME} ${TOOLBOX_NAME}]"
fi
}
----

Now you can include `is_toolbox` in your `PS1` variable and not need to execute any extra commands in order to know whether or not your are in a toolbox or host shell.

.Example:
[source,bash]
----
export PS1="\[\e[31m\]\`is_toolbox\`\]\e[m\]\[\e[32m\]\\$ \[\e[m\]\[\e[37m\]❱\[\e[m\] "
----

This results in a prompt which appears as such when not in a toolbox: `$ ❱`

However, when running in a toolbox named "default" looks like: `[toolbox default]$ ❱`


This can be necessary if you want to interact with tools available from the host, for example `podman`, `nmcli` or `rpm-ostree` without leaving the Toolbx container in between.
You can use `flatpak-spawn`, included in the base installation for this:

[source,bash]
----
$ flatpak-spawn --host podman --help
----

If the application you want to call requires `sudo` access, the `-S` option must be supplied to `sudo` like below:

[source,bash]
----
$ flatpak-spawn --host sudo -S rpm-ostree status
----

If you find yourself using commands like these frequently to access e.g. the flatpak command from inside the Toolbx container, you can create yourself a short custom wrapper script (*inside the Toolbx container*).
To do this, perform the following steps:

. Define the `istoolbx` alias (for convenience) by executing the command mentioned above in your terminal.
. Make sure you are in a Toolbx container.
If the following command doesn't produce any output, you are likely still working on the host!
+
[source,bash]
----
[toolbx]$ istoolbx
<Toolbx container name here>
----
. Once you have made sure you're in a Toolbx container, execute the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
[toolbx]$ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nexec /usr/bin/flatpak-spawn --host flatpak "$@"' | \
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/flatpak 1>/dev/null && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flatpak
----

You now have a `flatpak` command available that allows you to interact with `flatpak` as if you were running the command on the host.



Some directories in `ostree`-based operating systems are writable by the user, like `/etc`.
You can get a quick overview of the files changed under `/etc` using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff
----

To get a more elaborate diff, you can use something like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo diff -yrW200 --suppress-common-lines --color=always /usr/etc /etc 2>/dev/null
----

[NOTE]
====
This works because ostree keeps an unmodified copy of the `/etc` directory under `/usr/etc`.
All of your changes go to `/etc` directly.
====



The most noticable change when using Flatpak applications instead of conventional installations is that the applications cannot be directly called from the CLI any more, like so:

[source,bash]
----
$ evince
bash: command not found: evince
----

Instead, one can call them like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ flatpak run org.gnome.Evince
----

In addition, most Flatpak applications export their internal binaries under an installation-dependent location:

* For Flatpak applications installed from `system` remotes, these can be found under `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/`.
* For Flatpak applications installed from `user` remotes, these can be found under `$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin/`.

[NOTE]
====
If you're unsure to which installation a Flatpak application belongs, you can use this command to print it out:

[source,bash]
----
$ flatpak list --app --columns=name,installation
----
====

You can then either add these directories to your `$PATH`:

[source,bash]
----
$ org.gnome.Evince
----

or setup shell `alias`es as needed to make them available to the CLI like so:

[source,bash]
----
$ alias evince="flatpak run org.gnome.Evince"
### or:
alias evince="org.gnome.Evince"
$ evince

This page provides a brief overview of configuration details specific for Fedora, and is common to both the package-based Sway Spin and the Sway Atomic variant.
Important differences will be highlighted.

The Sway package in Fedora defers most of the dependencies and the config file ownership to the `sway-config-*` subpackages.
This allows us to ship different configuration profiles with different sets of runtime dependencies.

The following profile packages are currently available in Fedora:

* *sway-config-upstream* - the upstream configuration as it comes with the Sway sources.
The only permitted modifications to this profile's config file are adjustments for dependencies currently unavailable in Fedora.
* *sway-config-minimal* - minimal configuration with any optional dependencies excluded.
The profile was created for headless servers, containers and buildroot usage.
It is also suitable for building a very minimal installation from scratch.
* *sway-config-fedora* - customized configuration for Fedora Sway Spin.

The packages are mutually exclusive, and one of these must be present.
The one installed by default with `dnf install sway` is *sway-config-upstream* and the one that will be installed with Sway Spin/Sway Desktop Environment group is *sway-config-fedora*.

You can select the profile with following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo dnf swap sway-config sway-config-upstream
$ sudo dnf swap sway-config sway-config-minimal
$ sudo dnf swap sway-config sway-config-fedora
----

The command will replace the default `/etc/sway/config` file and apply the new set of dependencies.
Packages unused by the new profile will be autoremoved.

The corresponding incantation for Sway Atomic and other custom Sway images is:

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo rpm-ostree override remove sway-config --install sway-config-upstream
----

Note, however, that it does not remove the original profile dependencies from the base layer of a deployment.


{config-repo}[*sway-config-fedora*] contains the default configuration for Fedora Sway Spin.
It is built on top of the default Sway config with a few quality of life improvements and opinionated changes.

Most of the additions are implemented as a standalone configuration snippets stored at {config-dir}/sway/config.d[`/usr/share/sway/config.d/`] and automatically loaded from the main configuration file.
Environment configuration and logging interception are implemented in the {config-file}/sway/start-sway[`/usr/bin/start-sway`] wrapper script.


If you are using a compatible Display Manager (GDM or SDDM), you should be able to adjust the initial environment for Sway using a system-wide configuration at `/etc/sway/environment` or per-user config at `~/.config/sway/environment`.
The variables set in the user configuration overwrite matching variables set system-wide.

Please, check the comments and examples in {config-file}/sway/environment[`/etc/sway/environment`] to learn more.


The configuration snippets we provide are grouped into the following sections:

50-59 (`50-rules-*.conf`):: Window rules (`for_window`, `assign` and related configuration).
60-69 (`60-bindings-\*.conf`, `65-mode-*.conf`):: Key bindings and binding modes.
90-94 (`90-*.conf`):: System applications: bars, idle daemons and other components.
95-99 (`95-*.conf`):: Autostart applications.


Fedora configuration pass:[<del>ab</del>]uses the implementation details of the Sway configuration parser (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wordexp.3p.html[`wordexp(3p)`]) to implement an overrides mechanism for the snippets.

The priority increases from the packaged configuration to a system-wide configuration and an user configuration directories:

* `/usr/share/sway/config.d/*.conf`
* `/etc/sway/config.d/*.conf`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d/*.conf` (defaults to `+~/.config/sway/config.d/*.conf+`)

The includes are also sorted by a file name across all the directories.

By creating a file with the same name in `/etc/sway/config.d` you'll force the config preprocessor to ignore the corresponding snippet from `/usr` and load the one from `/etc`.
Similarly, the configuration snippet from a home directory wins over the earlier locations.

To put it even more simple: imagine the distribution configuration file `/usr/share/sway/config.d/90-bar.conf` that sets `waybar` as a status bar.
If you want to prevent `waybar` from starting, you could create an empty file in your home directory:

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/sway/config.d
$ touch ~/.config/sway/config.d/90-bar.conf
----

If you want to use another bar, you just need to add some contents to the file.
For example, copy the default bar section from the upstream Sway config:

[source]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/sway/config.d
$ cat >~/.config/sway/config.d/90-bar.conf <<EOF
## Read `man 5 sway-bar` for more information about this section.
bar {
position top

## When the status_command prints a new line to stdout, swaybar updates.
## The default just shows the current date and time.
status_command while date +'%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S %p'; do sleep 1; done

colors {
statusline #ffffff
background #323232
inactive_workspace #32323200 #32323200 #5c5c5c
}
}
EOF
----


Sometimes it's useful to know how the configuration loaded by Sway actually looks.
There are two ways to debug that:

* Run sway config validation:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sway --debug --validate [--config /path/to/config]
----

* Check intermediate files generated by the layered include script
+
[source]
----
$ less $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/sway/layered-include-*.conf
----
