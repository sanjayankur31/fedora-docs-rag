= Joining the Package Maintainers

So, you have decided to become a package maintainer in the Fedora Project?
This guide will lead you through your first package submission.
It can be a completely new package,
or update to an existing package.

== Preparation

=== Understand the Sponsorship Model

Admission to the \&#96;packager\&#96; group,
which is a prerequisite for many packaging tasks,
is not automatic.
You should at least skim through xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[How to Get Sponsored into the Packager Group] now,
so that in the likely case that you want to apply,
you are prepared for it.

[\&#35;read_the_guidelines]
=== Read the Guidelines

If you do not know how to create an RPM package,
refer to xref:Packaging_Tutorial.adoc[Packaging Tutorial].

Read the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines].
You need to be thoroughly familiar with these.
They govern all package submissions.
If you have questions, ask on the Fedora List.

[\&#35;create_a_bugzilla_account]
=== Create a Bugzilla Account

Make sure you have an account in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/[Red Hat Bugzilla].

The email address that you use for your Bugzilla account
should be the same email address as you use in the xref:create_a_fedora_account[Fedora Account System] for all things related to Fedora Packaging.

[\&#35;create_a_fedora_account]
=== Create a Fedora Account

Create an account in the xref:fedora-accounts::user.adoc[Fedora Account System].
(This is _not_ the same as the Bugzilla account.)

. Visit the account system home: https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/

. Click on _New account_ and fill in the blanks.
Note that the email you give should be
the same as the one you gave Bugzilla.
This allows the system to link privileges
between the two accounts.

. After you create your account,
please be sure to agree to the Fedora CLA:
Click on the _edit profile_ link on the right,
then the _Agreements_ tab.
If this says _view_ you have agreed already,
if it says _sign_ you still need to agree.

. You will also need to upload a public RSA SSH key.
You need to use the matching private key
to access Fedora machines via SSH.
Keep in mind that uploading new public SSH key to all servers can take some time (about half hour).
You can read more about this https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cryptography[here].

[\&#35;join_the_important_mailing_lists]
=== Join the important Mailing Lists

Consider joining the following mailing lists:


[\&#35;introduce_yourself]
=== Introduce yourself

Next, you should introduce yourself to the community on the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel mailing] list.
The primary purpose of this is
to begin the process of building trust
by allowing the Fedora community members
to get to know you a bit more.

We want to break anonymity and foster real-world community within the project.
You are under no obligation to reveal personal secrets.
The objective is to establish a level of trust
between yourself and the other members of the project.
But you should at least use your real name
when communicating with us.
Also, a brief description of who you are,
your motivations
and perhaps a description of the software you have submitted for review
are advisable.

\&#8230;.
Subject: Self Introduction:  \&lt;Your name\&gt;

Body:  Add any information you believe is applicable
including past experience in free and open source projects,
a link to the review request you have filed and
a brief description of yourself. You can also post
your GPG key information if you want to.
\&#8230;.

Feel free to participate in all the discussion
that goes on in any of the lists.
Community discussion and feedback is always encouraged.

[\&#35;understand_your_responsibilities]
=== Understand your responsibilities

Software components included in Fedora need to be maintained actively,
and bugs — especially security issues —
need to be fixed in a timely manner.
As a Fedora package maintainer,
it is your primary responsibility to ensure this.

\&#42; Understand xref:fesco::Package_maintainer_responsibilities.adoc[Package Maintainer Responsibilities].

\&#42; Get familiar with xref:fesco::Policy_for_encouraging_comaintainers_of_packages.adoc[Policy for Encouraging Comaintainers of Packages].

\&#42; Do not be afraid to seek the help of the Fedora community
via the development mailing list
whenever needed.

[\&#35;read_other_submissions]
=== Read Other Submissions

Read some other package submissions
to learn about packaging
and gain familiarity with the process and requirements.

One way of doing this is to join the
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-review@lists.fedoraproject.org/[package-review mailing list].
All comments on Fedora package reviews are sent to this
(read-only from your point of view)
list.

[\&#35;configure_your_git]
=== Configure Your Git

The first thing to do when you set up Fedora packaging
is to configure your username and email address for Git.
These are linked in each commit you do to Fedora packages.

\&#8230;.
git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;install_the_developer_client_tools]
=== Install Packager Tools

Follow xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools].

[\&#35;find_software]
== Finding software you wish to maintain for Fedora

Being a Fedora packager means doing package maintenance.
To get started, you need to find some packages to maintain.

[\&#35;find_software_existing]
=== Existing software

Even packages that already exist in Fedora
need regular maintenance.
The Fedora version may be behind the latest upstream release,
there may be bugs to be fixed
upstream or in the packaging scripts,
the packaging scripts can be improved even if the resulting package already works
and so on.

To get involved in the maintenance of some packages,
you should know what is going on with them.
Subscribe to notifications about packages you consider interesting
by adjusting the _Watch_ setting for them
in the https://src.fedoraproject.org[Package Sources].

There are also mailing lists for notifications about activity in any package.
Note that the volume of these mailing lists is very high.
Most probably they are only useful as input for automatic processing:

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/scm-commits@lists.fedoraproject.org/[scm-commits]
has all commits to all package repositories.

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[package-announce]
has all stable updates.

[\&#35;find_software_new]
=== New software

If you intend to add a new package to Fedora,
follow xref:New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors.adoc[New Package Process for New Contributors].

[\&#35;getting_help]
== Getting Help

We know that this process can be as clear as mud sometimes,
and we're always trying to make it better.
If you run into any problems,
or have any questions
please ask on the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel mailing list]
or on https://libera.chat/[Libera].

[\&#35;one_off_contributions]
== One-off contributions

Changes to https://src.fedoraproject.org/browse/projects/[existing packages]
can be suggested as explained in xref:Pull_Request_Guide.adoc[Pull Request Guide].


= Installing Packager Tools

[\&#35;installing]
== Installing

The \&#96;fedora-packager\&#96; package provides tools to help you setup and work with Fedora.
It will bring in everything necessary for general packaging work.
Run the following:

----
$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
----

== Configuration

=== SSH key

You also must have an ssh key configured in the
https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Accounts System]
to be able to make changes to any package, including your own.
\&#96;fedpkg\&#96; will expect the correct ssh key to be available in your keyring.
See wiki page https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cryptography\&#35;OpenSSH[Cryptography: OpenSSH]
for more information.

[\&#35;mock]
=== Mock

To be able to test the build procedure in a clean chroot with
https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/[Mock],
you need to configure your account to be a member of the \&#96;mock\&#96; group:

----
$ sudo usermod -a -G mock \&lt;your_local_username\&gt;
----

[\&#35;kerberos_ticket]
== Acquiring a Kerberos ticket

A https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Kerberos[Kerberos] ticket is necessary for accessing many Fedora services,
such as xref:Using_the_Koji_Build_System.adoc[Koji]
and the xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc\&#35;upload_new_source_files[lookaside cache].

To acquire valid Kerberos ticket, do:

----
$ fkinit -u \&lt;your_fedora_accounts_username\&gt;
----

Kerberos tickets have a set expiration time,
so you will frequently have to renew it with \&#96;kinit -R\&#96; before it expires
or acquire a new one.

Alternatively, if you are using Fedora Workstation
and don't have xref:fedora-accounts::user.adoc\&#35;twofactor[2FA enabled]
on your Fedora account, you may add it through GNOME Online Accounts.

To verify you can authenticate to Koji, use a following, no-operation \&#96;koji\&#96;
command.  Observe that it reports your Fedora username and that it confirms
a GSSAPI (an encapsulation method for Kerberos) authentication:

----
$ koji moshimoshi
\&lt;A hello message\&gt;, \&lt;your_fedora_accounts_username\&gt;!

You are using the hub at https://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub
Authenticated via GSSAPI
----

== Git Index Version

Some tools, such as \&#96;fedpkg mockbuild\&#96;, only work with git repositories with
index version ≤ 2.
You can check the index version of the working repo byrunning

----
$ git update-index --show-index-version
----

If it outputs a number larger than 2, you can change the index version to 2:

----
$ git update-index --index-version 2
----

Globally, https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index\&#35;Documentation/git-update-index.txt---index-versionltngt[Git defaults to an index version based on the feature used].
If you are comfortable with using Git index version 2 by default for future Git repositories, run

----
$ git config --global index.version 2
----


= How to Get Sponsored into the Packager Group

xref:fesco::Packager_sponsor_policy.adoc[Packager sponsor policy]
governs sponsorship for the _packager_ group.
This page contains some additional tips that are not part of the policy.

[\&#35;discovering]
== Discovering packages that need maintenance

[\&#35;adopting]
=== Orphaned packages

You can find orphaned packages in need of maintenance in notifications sent to the
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] mailing list.
If you notice an orphaned package that you are willing to maintain,
post to devel,
explaining that you are not in the packager group yet,
but that after you have completed the sponsoring process,
you are interested in adopting or co-maintaining the package.
The kind of replies you may get include:

\&#42; A warning to reconsider this plan,
due to serious problems with the package.

\&#42; A note that the package has already been adopted,
possibly with an invitation to contribute in its maintenance
(which itself may lead to eventual sponsoring through the co-maintenance route.)

\&#42; An offer to help with the process,
perhaps from the previous maintainer or a potential sponsor.

[\&#35;commenting]
=== Review requests

If you plan to comment on review requests to demonstrate your level of understanding,
you can search the https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/in_progress.html[list of reviews in progress]
and the https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/reviewable.html[list of unassigned review requests]
for review requests to comment on.

[\&#35;how_to_find_a_sponsor]
== How to find a sponsor

If you have not yet been sponsored, request sponsorship by https://pagure.io/packager-sponsors/issues[raising an issue at packager-sponsors].
You may contact sponsors directly through https://docs.pagure.org/fedora-sponsors/[Sponsors page].
It will help you find the right sponsor for you
based on programming language preference, domains of interest, native language, and other criteria.



= How to Sponsor a New Contributor

[\&#35;becoming_a_fedora_package_collection_sponsor]
== Becoming a Fedora Package Collection Sponsor

The Fedora Package Collection has been setup so
to encourage 'learning by doing'
and the development of cooperative relationships
between Fedora packagers.
Once packagers have acquired sufficient packaging knowledge
to help others through the process,
they may apply for sponsor status.
As 'sufficient knowledge' is unworkably vague,
the following guidelines have been established.
Prospective sponsors should:

\&#42; Maintain at least three packages.

\&#42; Have done five high quality, nontrivial package reviews.

\&#42; Have been members of the packager group
for at least one release cycle
(generally six months)
so that they have seen the process of branching
for a new release.

These are still somewhat vague to allow for flexibility
but should provide a reasonable idea of how much experience is required.

If you're a packager
and feel that you are ready
and would like to move up to sponsor status,
simply file a ticket in the https://pagure.io/packager-sponsors/issues[packager sponsors ticket system].
These tickets are automatically sent to the sponsors list.
A report will be added
containing information on your reviewed and owned/comaintained packages,
but feel free to provide additional information that can't easily be found
such as informal reviews done
or prospective packagers you would like to sponsor.

Votes will be collected in the ticket for a week.
At the end of that time,
if the differential between positive and negative votes
stands at +3 or greater,
your request will be approved
and you'll be promoted to sponsor status immediately.
If not, your request will be closed.
You may reapply anytime you feel you have more support.
After waiting an hour or so
for the new permissions to propagate through the system,
you will be able to sponsor new packagers.

[\&#35;sponsoring_someone_for_fedora_package_collection]
== Sponsoring Someone for Fedora Package Collection

Sponsoring someone
for access to Fedora Package Collection
is relatively simple.
If you are looking for someone to sponsor,
take a look at the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Account system]
for contributors who are currently searching for a sponsor.
Note that they should also have submitted a package review request
for a package which they are proposing to add to Fedora
on https://bugzilla.redhat.com[Red Hat Bugzilla].
In this request they should write that they need a sponsor.

Bugzilla will send a notification mail for the new review request
to the fedora-package-review mailing list.
Take a look at their package and review it.
If it looks reasonable and it seems that the comply with the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines],
then they are probably a good candidate to be sponsored.

Add any comment for changes to the review request on Bugzilla
which look as though they'd be needed for compliance
as well as the fact that you're volunteering to sponsor them.
Once they've made those changes,
you can approve the package
and sponsor the user in the Fedora account system.
Before you approve the user,
please make sure that his/her email in https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Account system] is the same as in https://bugzilla.redhat.com[Red Hat Bugzilla].
After that,
go to https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/packager/,
log in,
then add the username in the 'add user' field
located to the right of the top of the 'Members' section,
then press enter.

A new packager cannot, at this time,
make changes to packages he does not own or comaintain
until he applies to become a xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc[provenpackager]
but you should still keep an eye on them.
Generally the easiest way to do this
is for them to become comaintainers of at least the initial package they review.
You should be sure to review their commits to the Git repository
for how they look,
and consider watching their Bugzilla activity
at least for a while (Preferences→Email Preferences→https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=email[User Watching]).
Respond with any comments that you might have
and guide them,
providing assistance as they need it for any tasks.
A provenpackager can step in if necessary.

So what's the downside to sponsoring someone?
Your sponsoree will likely have questions about processes;
one of your responsibilities as a sponsor
is to help them with the answers.
A sponsor isn't expected to be omniscient, though,
so you can feel free to ask for others' advice and opinions
if you get a really hard question.
xref:fesco::Packager_sponsor_policy.adoc[Sponsor responsibilities are detailed here].

[\&#35;sponsoring_someone_for_provenpackagers]
== Sponsoring Someone for provenpackagers

xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc[Provenpackagers] have access to most packages.
FESCo members should forward requests for provenpackagers
to the sponsors mailing list
where sponsors can give their advice
on the provenpackager request.
Provenpackagers may nominate themselves,
but having a sponsor endorse the nomination
or proposing the packager to become a provenpackager
(the packager should agree)
is certainly a good thing.

By granting membership into the provenpackager group for a maintainer
you are confirming that
(at least in your mind)
they meet the criteria for that group,
and that you would trust them fully
with any of the packages you either maintain
or even just use.

Provenpackagers are approved on at least 3 positive votes with no negative votes.
In the event of negative votes,
the decision will be made by FESCo at their next meeting.
See the xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc[provenpackager description] for more information.

[\&#35;welcome_note]
== Welcome Note

Once you have sponsored someone,
we request that you send a note to Fedora devel mailing list
welcoming the new contributor
and cc the person you have sponsored.
Public recognition of any contributor
would help them feel appreciated
and motivate them to contribute more.
It would also help establish Fedora as a community of people and friends
rather than merely a technical body of work.



\&#42; Bugzilla
= Bug Status Workflow

This document describes best practices for setting Bugzilla status for bugs and feature requests.
For Change proposal trackers, use the Bugzilla status described in the xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc\&#35;_bugzilla_trackers[Changes policy].

== Statuses

The image below presents a general flow chart for bugs in the typical case.
The flow is bi-directional: a bug can revert to a previous status if, for example, a proposed fix is incomplete.

image::program_management::fedora-bug-lifecycle.png[]

The table below summarizes the statuses.
More details, including additional keywords, flags, and resolutions are given in the following sections.




== Resolutions

The table below describes the resolutions that can apply to the _CLOSED_ status.




== Priority and Severity

=== Severity

The _Severity_ field is used to indicate the bug's importance.
The values for the severity field should be assigned with reference to the following guidance:

\&#42; _Urgent_: the bug makes whole system unusable (or it is a security bug, which is per definition urgent)
\&#42; _High_: the bug makes the program in question unusable, or a major packaging guideline violation (license problem, bundled library, etc)
\&#42; _Medium_: a real bug which makes program more difficult to use, at least part of the program is available; possibly workarounds are available
\&#42; _Low_: anything else - cosmetic issues, corner cases with unusual (non-default) configurations, etc.

WARNING: The _Urgent_ setting should not usually be used for hardware-specific bugs: a bug which causes the entire distribution to be affected but is restricted to a single specific type of hardware should usually be set to _High_.
For instance, if a bug prevents X.org working correctly on a single particular graphics chipset, use the _High_ severity, not _Urgent_.

For most packages, most issues are likely to be of _Medium_ severity.
These are not hard and fast rules.
Use your best judgement in setting the severity field appropriately.
There are obvious cases which require the exercise of judgement—for instance, a bug which affects more than just the program in which it occurs, but less than the 'whole system'.

=== Priority

The _Priority_ field may be used, at their choice, by maintainers to keep track of the order in which they wish to address bugs in their package(s).
This may be done with relation to the severity setting, or by any other method the maintainer chooses, at the maintainer's sole discretion.
It may also be entirely ignored, if the maintainer in question does not wish to use it
No-one other than the maintainer or team responsible for a particular bug should change this setting.




\&#42; New Package Process
= New Package Process for Existing Contributors

This is a short version of the New Package Process,
streamlined to show how existing contributors can make new packages.

. Read the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines]
and xref:packaging-guidelines::Naming.adoc[Package Naming Guidelines].
Really.
Be comfortable with them.

. Make a package.

\&#42;\&#42; You should make sure that it is a new package.
A list of existing packages in Fedora Packages is here: https://src.fedoraproject.org/projects/rpms/\&#42;

\&#42;\&#42; Some information on how to create an RPM package is in xref:Packaging_Tutorial.adoc[Packaging Tutorial].

\&#42;\&#42; Make sure that your package meets the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines]
and xref:packaging-guidelines::Naming.adoc[Package Naming Guidelines]

\&#42;\&#42; Be aware of https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items[forbidden items]
and xref:packaging-guidelines::ReviewGuidelines.adoc[Package Review Guidelines].
They will be used during the package review.

. Upload your SRPM and SPEC files onto the internet somewhere.

\&#42;\&#42; If you have already got a Fedora Account
then you can use your storage at https://fedorapeople.org for this.

. Make sure you have a Bugzilla account at bugzilla.redhat.com

. Fill out https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora\&amp;format=fedora-review[Bugzilla Fedora review form] to create a review request.

\&#42;\&#42; Make sure you put the name of the package in the \&#96;Review Summary\&#96; field,
along with a very brief summary of what it is

\&#42;\&#42; Make sure that you put the URL paths for the SPEC file and the SRPM file in the \&#96;Review Description\&#96;

\&#42;\&#42; Put a description of your package
(usually, this can be the same thing as what you put in the spec \&#96;%description\&#96;)
in \&#96;Review Description\&#96;

\&#42;\&#42; The review process is described in detail in xref:packaging-guidelines::ReviewGuidelines.adoc[Package Review Guidelines].

. Watch the review request in Bugzilla.
Fix any blockers that the reviewer(s) point out.

. When the package is approved, request a distgit repository for your package.

\&#42;\&#42; Make sure the reviewer is the Assignee in your Bugzilla ticket.

\&#42;\&#42; Request a distgit repository with \&#96;fedpkg request-repo PACKAGE-NAME BUGZILLA-TICKET-NUMBER\&#96;.
(xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package Maintenance Guide] has more information about \&#96;fedpkg\&#96;.)
You might need to get a pagure-API-token
before being able to successfully request the repo.

\&#42;\&#42; When the repo is created, it only contains the \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch.
If you want to bring the package to other Fedora releases,
see xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc\&#35;requesting_branches[Requesting branches].

\&#42;\&#42; If the package is only intended for EPEL, the \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch \&#42;must\&#42; be retired.
See xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc\&#35;epel-only_branches[Retirement of \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch in EPEL-only packages]
for instructions.

. Once the requests have been processed,
checkout the distgit repository with \&#96;fedpkg clone \&lt;packagename\&gt;\&#96;.

. Import your srpm

\&#42;\&#42; First \&#96;fkinit -u username\&#96;

\&#42;\&#42; Then you can import the approved SRPM into the rawhide branch by running \&#96;fedpkg import libfoo-x.x.x.src.rpm; git commit -m 'Initial import (fedora\&#35;nnnnnn).'\&#96; (where \&#96;nnnnnn\&#96; is your Bugzilla package review bug number). If your package is using _autochangelog_, writing the bug number as specified will make Bodhi automatically close the bug when your package is submitted to Rawhide stable repository.

\&#42;\&#42; Obviously, replace \&#96;libfoo-x.x.x.src.rpm\&#96; with the full path to your approved SRPM.

\&#42;\&#42; You should see it upload the sources,
and finish successfully.
If you didn't set up \&#96;ssh-agent\&#96;
it will ask often for your ssh-key passphrase.
This is normal.

\&#42;\&#42; Now run \&#96;git push\&#96; to get the final versions in your rawhide branch.

. You can now import the package to your branches
(which you requested in Step 7)
too

\&#42;\&#42; The quickest way to do this is to use \&#96;fedpkg switch-branch BRANCH\&#96;
to switch the branch
(where \&#96;BRANCH\&#96; can be \&#96;f13\&#96; and so on).

\&#42;\&#42; Now you can \&#96;git merge rawhide\&#96;.
This will get \&#96;.spec\&#96; file, \&#96;.gitignore\&#96; and source file
together with any patches and other files from the rawhide branch
and create an identical commit.

\&#42;\&#42; Previous step already created commit for you,
now you can push the results using \&#96;fedpkg push\&#96; or \&#96;git push\&#96;.

. Request builds

\&#42;\&#42; For each branch that you'd like to request a build for,
switch using \&#96;fedpkg switch-branch\&#96; and run \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;.

\&#42;\&#42; If everything goes well,
it should queue up your branch for building,
the package will cleanly build,
and you're done!

\&#42;\&#42; If it fails to build,
the buildsystem will send you an email
to report the failure
and link you to the logs.
Commit any needed changes to git,
bump the spec release number
and request a new build.

. Close the Bugzilla ticket
(assuming that the package built successfully)

\&#42; You should close it with resolution \&#96;NEXTRELEASE\&#96; or \&#96;RAWHIDE\&#96;,
depending on where you built the package.
The resolution field will appear after you set the status field to \&#96;CLOSED\&#96;.

. If this package will be built for any version of Fedora that is already released
please submit it for inclusion in the \&#96;fedora-updates\&#96; repository
for those versions of Fedora.
See xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc\&#35;Later_Branched_and_stable_releases[Package Update Guide] for more details.

. Add the package to the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_and_edit_comps.xml_for_package_groups[comps file(s)] if appropriate.

. Consider enabling xref:Upstream_Release_Monitoring.adoc[Upstream Release Monitoring] for the package.

We know that this process can be as clear as mud sometimes,
we're always trying to make it better.
If you run into any problems,
or have any questions,
please ask on the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora development list].

xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package Maintenance Guide] may also be of use.



= New Package Process for New Contributors

This is a long version of the New Package Process,
containing more details so new contributors can follow it more easily.
Also the mandatory xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[sponsoring] step is included.

[\&#35;install_tools]
== Install Packager Tools

Follow xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools].

[\&#35;check]
== Check if the package already exists

If some useful software is not included in Fedora already,
you can submit it as a new package.
The package you are submitting can be of any Free and Open Source project.

Before creating your package,
make sure that the software is not already in the Fedora repository:

\&#42; Check if the package already exists by searching in
https://packages.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Packages].

\&#42; Search in the https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/[Review Tracker]
for packages under review.

\&#42; Check the https://packager-dashboard.fedoraproject.org/user/orphan[orphaned or retired packages that need new maintainers].

\&#42; Be aware of https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items[forbidden items].

[\&#35;make_a_package]
== Make a Package

\&#42; If you don't know how to create an RPM package,
see the xref:Packaging_Tutorial.adoc[Packaging Tutorial].

\&#42; Make sure that your package meets the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines] and xref:packaging-guidelines::Naming.adoc[Package Naming Guidelines].

\&#42; Be aware of the xref:packaging-guidelines::ReviewGuidelines.adoc[Package Review Guidelines]
(they will be used during the package review).

\&#42; Make sure your package builds.
This is surprisingly important
because a significant number of submissions don't.

[\&#35;upload_your_package]
== Upload Your Package

Upload your SRPM and SPEC files onto the Internet somewhere
so that others can retrieve them.
This can be anywhere accessible by a URL,
but it is important that the files be directly accessible,
not hidden behind some service
that makes people wait to download things
or redirects through advertising pages.

Using https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org[Copr] is recommended.
It allows creating repositories using the src.rpm or spec file,
which can be then shared with the reviewers.
It also can create automatic builds from these files
and distribute the results.

First you need to log to https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org[Copr],
you can use your Fedora account.

Then follow this https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/screenshots_tutorial.html[tutorial],
to build the project.
During the 'New Build' step you need to upload your source,
you can choose the one which works for you the best,
but if you don't have the source uploaded somewhere else,
you can select the _Upload_ option
and then in the provide the step section,
click on _Browse\&#8230;_ button to select a file.
Now in the next section you need to specify the Chroots
and other built options,
select at least one \&#96;fedora-rawhide\&#96; chroot
and adjust other settings as necessary.

After the build is completed
you can use the following links for the review process:

\&#42; Link to Spec file:
go to your copr packages,
click the name of your package
and then under general information look for your dist-git repositary.
Find the \&#42;Spec\&#42; file in this repository tree and copy it's link,
but replace the \&#42;tree\&#42; part of the URL with the string \&#42;plain\&#42;,
then use it for the review submission.

\&#42; Link to SRPM file:
in your copr builds,
click on the \&#42;id\&#42; of your last successful build
and under general information look for link named directory.
Here look in to the \&#42;/srpm-build/your_build_id/\&#42; folder
and copy the \&#42;src.rpm\&#42; file URL for your review submission.

[\&#35;create_your_review_request]
== Create Your Review Request

Fill out https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora\&amp;format=fedora-review[Bugzilla Fedora review form].

\&#42; Before submitting your request,
be sure there’s not a previous request for the same package.
There is a convenient search box on the https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/[package review status page].

\&#42; Make sure that you put the \&#42;name of the package\&#42;
(excluding version and release numbers)
in the \&#96;Review Summary\&#96; field,
along with a very \&#42;brief summary\&#42; of what the package is.

\&#42; Put a \&#42;description\&#42; of your package
(usually, this can be the same thing
as what you put in the spec \&#96;%description\&#96;)
in the \&#96;Review Description\&#96; field.
Include the \&#42;URLs\&#42; to your \&#42;SRPM\&#42; and \&#42;SPEC\&#42; files.

\&#42; Explain in the ticket that this is your first package
and you need a sponsor.
Also, include any information that may help prospective sponsors.
If you've been active in other review work, include links.
If you're the upstream maintainer, be sure to say so.

\&#42; For bonus points,
include a link to a successful koji build
so that everyone knows you did all of your homework.

The review process is described in detail on the xref:Package_Review_Process.adoc[Package Review Process] page.

[\&#35;inform_upstream]
== Inform Upstream

The Fedora Project prefers xref:Staying_Close_to_Upstream_Projects.adoc[Staying Close to Upstream Projects].
Inform the developers that you are packaging the software.
You can do that by sending them an email
introducing yourself and pointing out the review request.
This sets up the stage for future conversations.
They will usually advertise the fact
that their software is now part of Fedora
or might want to inform you
of important bugs in the existing release,
future roadmaps
etc.

[\&#35;watch_for_feedback]
== Watch for Feedback

Watch the Bugzilla report for your first package.
You should get notifications of changes by email.
Fix any blockers that the reviewer(s) point out.

[\&#35;get_sponsored]
== Get Sponsored

When the package is APPROVED by the reviewer,
you must separately obtain member sponsorship
in order to check in and build your package.
Sponsorship is not automatic
and may require that you further participate in other ways
in order to demonstrate your understanding of the packaging guidelines.
The key to becoming sponsored is
to convince an existing sponsor-level member
that you understand and follow the project's guidelines and processes.

See xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[How to Get Sponsored into the Packager Group]
for more information on the process of becoming sponsored.

Your sponsor can add you to the packager group.
You should receive an email confirmation of your sponsorship.

[\&#35;add_package_to_source_code_management_scm_system_and_set_owner]
== Add Package to Source Code Management (SCM) system and Set Owner

Before proceeding, please sync your account by login on https://src.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Package Sources]
using your FAS credentials.

If you are becoming a maintainer for a new package,
instead of being a co-maintainer,
use https://pagure.io/fedpkg[fedpkg]
to request a new git repository for your package.
The sub-command is \&#96;fedpkg request-repo\&#96;
which includes help text for setting up the Pagure API token
the command requires.
When creating your API-key
choose toggle-all for the ACLs.
You must specify the repository name and review bug number.
For example:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-repo python-prometheus_client 1590452
\&#8230;.

The request will be reviewed and processed automatically.
After processing, you will have access to commit and build the package.
In case the automation does not work,
you can report the problem to https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/toddlers/issues[Toddlers issue tracker].

\&#96;fedpkg request-repo\&#96; only creates a branch for Rawhide.
To request branches for other Fedora releases,
see xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc\&#35;requesting_branches[Requesting branches].

[\&#35;check_out_the_distgit_repository]
== [[check_out_the_module]] Check out the distgit repository

You _could_ check out your distgit repository now,
but before doing that,
consider doing \&#96;mkdir ~/fedora-scm ; cd ~/fedora-scm\&#96;
— that way, all your files are inside a single directory.
Also, run \&#96;ssh-add\&#96;,
so that you won't have to keep typing in your key password.

Now you are ready to checkout your distgit repository from the SCM:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone \&lt;your_package\&gt;
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;test_your_package]
== Test Your Package

Refer to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Mock_to_test_package_builds[Using Mock to test package builds]
and xref:Using_the_Koji_Build_System.adoc\&#35;scratch_builds[Koji Scratch Builds]
for more information on testing your package.
Mock uses your local system
while Koji command line tool uses the Fedora build system server.

[\&#35;import_commit_and_build_your_package]
== Import, commit, and build your package

Now that you've checked out your (empty) distgit repository with \&#96;fedpkg\&#96;,
cd into the repository's main branch:

\&#8230;.
cd \&lt;package_name\&gt;
\&#8230;.

Run fedpkg to import the contents of the SRPM into the SCM:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg import \&lt;path_to_srpm\&gt;
\&#8230;.

\&#8230;.
\&#35; Review Changes, press 'q' to stop; Revert with: git reset --hard HEAD
git commit -m 'Initial import (fedora\&#35;XXXXXX).'
git push
fedpkg build
\&#8230;.

Obviously, replace \&#96;PATH_TO_SRPM\&#96; with the full path
(not URL)
to your approved SRPM,
and \&#96;XXXXXX\&#96; with the package review bug number.

If your package is using _autochangelog_, writing the bug number as specified
will make the Fedora update system automatically close the bug when your package is
submitted to Rawhide stable repository.

This imports into, commits, and builds only the \&#42;main\&#42;
(xref:releases::rawhide.adoc[Rawhide])
branch.

If the push fails with this kind of message:

\&#8230;.
W access for why DENIED to YOUR_ACCOUNT
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Could not push: Command '['git', 'push']' returned non-zero exit status 128
\&#8230;.

Then you don't have the necessary rights to modify that package branch.
View \&#96;\https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/PACKAGE_NAME\&#96; to request those rights.

For more information on using the Fedora package maintenance system,
see the xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package maintenance guide].

[\&#35;update_your_branches]
== Update Your Branches (if desired)

Branches are \&#96;f\&#35;\&#96;
(formerly \&#96;F-\&#35;\&#96; and before that \&#96;FC-\&#35;\&#96;),
\&#96;main\&#96;,
etc.
So \&#96;f\&#96; is the branch for Fedora.

To switch to a branch first:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg switch-branch \&lt;branch\&gt;
\&#8230;.

(e.g. \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96;)

Merge the initial commit from main (Rawhide),
creating an identical commit in the branch:

\&#8230;.
git merge rawhide
\&#8230;.

Push the changes to the server:

\&#8230;.
git push
\&#8230;.

Build the package:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg build
\&#8230;.

If there is another branch to work with
repeat _To switch to a branch_
and import and commit to each branch.

If everything goes well,
it should queue up your branch for building,
the package will cleanly build,
and you're done!

If it fails to build,
the build system will send you an email
to report the failure
and show you to the logs.
Commit any needed changes to git,
bump the SPEC release number,
and request a new build.

[\&#35;submit_package_as_update_in_bodhi]
=== Submit Package as Update in Bodhi

The Fedora update system called https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org[Bodhi]
is used for pushing updates,
classifying packages
etc.
You do not need to submit updates for Rawhide (main) manually
because these are automatically created for you when the build completes.
For all other branches, you must manually push updates for all builds
that you would like to make available to users.

You can push an update using Bodhi
via the command line
using this in each branch:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg update
\&#8230;.


It is often easier to complete builds for all your branches
and then push a single update using the https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new[Bodhi web interface].
Bodhi is smart enough to split your update into individual updates,
one for each Fedora release branch.

You can also select multiple builds from different packages
to include in a single update using the web interface.
This is useful when you would like to push linked builds,
for example: an application package and its dependencies
that are necessary for it to run correctly.

Please see the xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc[Package Update Guide] for more details.

[\&#35;make_the_package_available_in_comps_files]
== Make the package available in 'comps' files

If appropriate for the package,
make it available in 'comps' files
so that it can be selected during installation
and included in dnf package group operations.
See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_and_edit_comps.xml_for_package_groups?rd=PackageMaintainers/CompsXml[How to use and edit comps.xml for package groups] for more info.

[\&#35;watch_for_updates]
=== Watch for updates

Fedora has the infrastructure available
for monitoring new upstream releases
of the software you are packaging.
Refer to xref:Upstream_Release_Monitoring.adoc[Upstream Release Monitoring]
for more details.





= Packaging Tutorial
:page-aliases: quick-docs::creating-rpm-packages.adoc

Packaging tutorial demonstrates RPM packaging for Fedora.

\&#42; xref:Packaging_Tutorial_1_banner.adoc[Packaging Tutorial 1: banner]
\&#42; xref:Packaging_Tutorial_2_GNU_Hello.adoc[Packaging Tutorial 2: GNU Hello]



= Packaging Tutorial 1: banner

This tutorial demonstrates RPM packaging
by packaging the https://github.com/pronovic/banner[banner] program.
It is a simple program with a simple
https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html[GNU Autotools] build script.

For comprehensive information on how to create RPM files,
refer to https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/[RPM Reference Manual].
If you plan to create an RPM package for the Fedora repository,
follow the process for xref:Joining_the_Package_Maintainers.adoc[Joining the Package Maintainers],
including following the various Fedora guidance.

This tutorial is intended to be run on a Fedora {MAJOROSVER} system.
It should, however, work also for other Fedora releases.
Just replace strings like \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96; with your release number.
Because this tutorial uses Fedora specific features that may not available in other environments,
Fedora downstreams such as CentOS Stream or Red Hat Enterprise Linux may or may not work.

The tutorial proceeds in step by step manner,
with most steps editing the package's specfile.
The final resulting specfile is listed in the end,
so in case there is any unclarity how a particular change should be applied,
you can peek there.

[\&#35;dev_env]
== Installing Packager Tools

Follow xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools].

[\&#35;building]
== Creating the package directory

In Fedora, package build instructions are organized in so called _dist-git_ repositories.
There is a separate repository for each package.
We mimic this system by creating a new directory for this tutorial.
In dist-git, the repository name matches the package name.
Fedora's rules for naming packages are written in https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Naming/[Naming Guidelines].
For banner, package should simply be named \&#96;banner\&#96;.
This is also the name of Fedora's https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/banner/banner/[official banner package].

----
$ mkdir banner \&amp;\&amp; cd banner
----

[\&#35;inside_spec]
== Inside a Spec File

RPM packages are configured by \&#96;.spec\&#96; files.
Tools such as \&#96;rpmdev-newspec\&#96; can be used to generate empty specfiles for different purposes.
For this tutorial, just create a file called \&#96;banner.spec\&#96; and paste the following minimal specfile.
It does not work yet, but we will try to build it and fix errors as we encounter them.

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
Name:     banner
Version:  1.3.6
Release:  %autorelease
Summary:  Prints a short string to the console in very large letters
License:  GPL-2.0-only
URL:      https://github.com/pronovic/banner
Source:   https://github.com/pronovic/banner/releases/download/BANNER_V%{version}/banner-%{version}.tar.gz

%description
This is a classic-style banner program similar to the one found in Solaris or
AIX in the late 1990s. It prints a short string to the console in very large
letters.

%prep
%autosetup

%build
%configure
%make_build

%install
%make_install

%files

%changelog
%autochangelog
----

The specfile starts with a set of _tags_, such as \&#96;Name:\&#96; and \&#96;Version:\&#96;,
followed by _sections_ such as \&#96;%description\&#96; and \&#96;%prep\&#96;.
Each tag fits into a single line, whereas each section continues until the next one starts.

Note that, confusingly, in addition to marking the section names,
the percent sign \&#96;%\&#96; also marks RPM _macros_.
Thus \&#96;%autosetup\&#96;, \&#96;%configure\&#96;, \&#96;%make_build\&#96;, \&#96;%make_install\&#96; and \&#96;%autochangelog\&#96; are not sections.

=== Tags

\&#96;Version\&#96; contains the version number of the packaged software.

\&#96;Release\&#96; numbers specfile updates, package rebuilds and other work within Fedora.
The value used here, \&#96;%autorelease\&#96;, is part of https://docs.pagure.org/fedora-infra.rpmautospec/index.html[rpmautospec],
which is https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Rpmautospec_by_Default[recommended for Fedora packages].
It ties \&#96;Release\&#96; to package's Git history.
As we do not have a Git repository, \&#96;%autorelease\&#96; will evaluate to the default value of 1.


Often, \&#96;Summary\&#96; can be copied from the upstream README.
The first letter should be uppercase to avoid \&#96;rpmlint\&#96; complaints.

\&#96;License\&#96; describes the license of the resulting binary package using a SPDX license identifier.
It must follow Fedora's https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-field/[licensing guidelines].
In practice, determining the correct value often means inspecting the license notifications in individual source files.
Upstream developers may also need to be asked for clarifications or corrections.
In this tutorial, we just take the upstream's word that the license is the GNU Public License, version 2.

\&#96;URL\&#96; points to upstream project's website,
which in this case is the GitHub repo's page.

\&#96;Source\&#96; defines the upstream sources used when building the package.
Usually, as in this case, it is a url pointing to a tarball released by the upstream,
but it can also be a local file.
There can be multiple \&#96;Source\&#96; tags if needed.

=== Sections

\&#96;%description\&#96; can often be copied from upstream README.

\&#96;%prep\&#96; contains a shell script for preparing the sources for building.
It is often just the single macro \&#96;%autosetup\&#96;,
which, in this case, simply extracts the source.

\&#96;%build\&#96; contains a shell script for the required build steps,
such as compiling sources to binaries.
Since banner's buildsystem is https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html[Autotools],
building it involves running \&#96;configure\&#96; and \&#96;make\&#96;.
Macros \&#96;%configure\&#96; and \&#96;%make_build\&#96; invoke these commands using Fedora's compilation flags and other configuration.

\&#96;%install\&#96; contains a shell script to copy the results from \&#96;%build\&#96; into an initially empty _build root_ directory.
As banner is using Autotools, macro \&#96;%make_install\&#96; is used.

\&#96;%files\&#96; lists the content of the resulting package.
Mostly, the files come from the build root created in the \&#96;%install\&#96;,
but documentation and license files can also be added directly from the sources.
This section is left empty for now, to be filled later.

The \&#96;+%changelog+\&#96; documents the changes in each new package version and release.
Changelog data can be displayed by \&#96;+rpm --query --changelog PACKAGE_NAME+\&#96;,
which can be useful, for instance, to find out if specific bug and security patches are included.
Its value,\&#96;+%autochangelog+\&#96;, also comes from \&#96;rpmautospec\&#96;.
It populates the changelog from Git commit messages.
As we do not have a Git repository, the changelog will be empty.

Lines which are not needed can be commented out with the hash \&#96;\&#35;\&#96;.

You can find more information in the RPM Reference Manual's section https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/spec.html[Spec file format].

== Downloading source

We need the source code defined by the \&#96;Source\&#96; tag, often referred to as the _upstream_ source.
This is most easily achieved by using the \&#96;spectool\&#96; command:

----
$ spectool -g banner.spec
----

You should now have the file listed in \&#96;Source\&#96; in your working directory:

----
$ ls \&#42;.tar.gz
banner-1.3.6.tar.gz
----

== Building the Package

We are ready for the first run to build source, binary and debugging packages.
This, and many other tasks, are done with the \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; tool.
The production builds for Fedora are built
in the https://koji.fedoraproject.org[Koji] build system,
which in turn uses https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/[Mock]
to manage isolated build environments.
To get as close to a production build as is locally possible,
we use the \&#96;fedpkg mockbuild\&#96; command
which also invokes Mock:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg --release f{MAJOROSVER} mockbuild
----

The build environment created by Mock is very basic.
It does not include a C compiler by default, so the build will fail.
The reason is explained in the output:

----
checking whether the C compiler works\&#8230; no
configure: error: in \&#96;/builddir/build/BUILD/banner-6':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See \&#96;config.log' for more details

RPM build errors:
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.R4Tf16 (%build)
Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.R4Tf16 (%build)
----

Additional build tools are defined
by adding \&#96;BuildRequires:\&#96; rows to the specfile.
In Fedora, GCC is the standard compiler, so we need to add a row for \&#96;gcc\&#96;.
Autotools also uses \&#96;make\&#96;, so a row should be added for it, too.
Add these lines after \&#96;Source\&#96;:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
BuildRequires:   gcc
BuildRequires:   make
----

Run a mockbuild again.

== Installing files

The next thing rpm will complain about are unpackaged files,
i.e. the files that would be installed in the system,
but were not declared as belonging to the package.
We need to declare them in the \&#96;%files\&#96; section.
Fixing these errors is an iterative process.
After declaring a missing file in the specfile, run \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; again,
then declare the next missing file and so on.

We will go through the file list one by one.

=== Executable

----
Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
/usr/bin/banner
----

This is the executable binary program.
\&#96;/usr/bin\&#96;, like many other system directories, have a
xref:packaging-guidelines::RPMMacros.adoc\&#35;macros_installation[default rpm macro] defined.
The macros should always be used when available,
so the executable is listed in \&#96;%files\&#96; as follows:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%files
%{_bindir}/banner
----

=== Man pages

----
Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
/usr/share/man/man1/banner.1.gz
----

The Packaging Guidelines have a dedicated section for
xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;_manpages[Manpages].
Following its instructions, manpages are list as follows:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%{_mandir}/man1/banner.1.\&#42;
----

At this point, mockbuild completes successfully,
but there are still more files that we should add to the package.

=== License file

Every package must install its license, tagged with \&#96;%license\&#96; directive.
In banner's case, as well as for many other projects,
the license file is located at the source tarball's top level,
and perhaps not copied to the buildroot during installation at all.
Regardless, it can be installed to the standard license directory
by using a relative path:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%files
%license COPYING
----

=== Additional documentation ===

Often, package sources contain documentation
that could be useful for the end users as well.
These can be installed and marked as documentation with the \&#96;%doc\&#96; directive.
Similarly to \&#96;%license\&#96;,
relative paths can be used to include files directly from the source tarball
rather than from the buildroot:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%doc AUTHORS ChangeLog NEWS README
----

== Checking the result with rpmlint

Next you should check for conformance with RPM design rules,
by running \&#96;rpmlint\&#96; on specfile, source rpm and binary rpm.
Command \&#96;fedpkg lint\&#96; does this:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg --release f{MAJOROSVER} lint
----

If all is good, there should be no warnings or errors.
For tutorial's sake, we intentionally left a mistake in the previous steps:

----
banner.x86_64: E: zero-length /usr/share/doc/banner/NEWS
----

Descriptions of various error codes can be queried with \&#96;rpmlint -e \&lt;error_code\&gt;\&#96;.
In this case, the unnecessary zero-length file must be removed.
Change the docs line to

----
%doc AUTHORS ChangeLog README
----

Run \&#96;fedpkg mockbuild\&#96; and \&#96;fedpkg lint\&#96; again and observe that the warning is fixed.

== Complete specfile

Here is the final version of \&#96;banner.spec\&#96;:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----

With this specfile,
you should be able to successfully complete the build process,
and create the source and binary RPM packages.

== Checking the result

Having a working specfile and rpms built from it,
the result can be checked.
Before checking the result by installing the package,
let us do some simple checks.
The RPM Package Manager \&#96;rpm\&#96; can be used for this.

=== Files

List the files contained in the package:

You can see that all the files listed in the specfile \&#96;%files\&#96; section are included.
Also, under \&#96;+/usr/lib/.build-id+\&#96;, there is an automatically generated file.
It is actually a symlink,
mapping a build id to the \&#96;banner\&#96; binary for debugging purposes.

=== Requires

List the package's runtime dependencies with the following command:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ rpm --query --package --requires results_banner/1.3.6/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/banner-1.3.6-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
libc.so.6()(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3.4)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.34)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.4)(64bit)
rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) \&lt;= 3.0.4-1
rpmlib(FileDigests) \&lt;= 4.6.0-1
rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) \&lt;= 4.0-1
rpmlib(PayloadIsZstd) \&lt;= 5.4.18-1
rtld(GNU_HASH)
----

To check which packages in Fedora repositories provide these dependencies,
you can use \&#96;dnf repoquery\&#96;:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ dnf -C repoquery --whatprovides 'libc.so.6()(64bit)'
glibc-0:2.38-16.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64
glibc-0:2.38-7.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64
----

You will see that the only dependency of _banner_ is \&#96;glibc\&#96;,
which provides symbols in \&#96;libc.so.6\&#96; as well as \&#96;rtld(GNU_HASH)\&#96;.

The \&#96;rpmlib\&#96; requires are special.
These specify various rpm features used in the rpm package itself,
constraining the version of \&#96;+rpm+\&#96; that can be used to install the package.

=== Provides

Conversely, to check what capabilities the package provides, you can do:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ rpm --query --package --provides results_banner/1.3.6/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/banner-1.3.6-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
banner = 1.3.6-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}
banner(x86-64) = 1.3.6-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}
----

The provides of this package are very simple.
It simply provides its own name,
in plain and architecture specific forms.

=== Installing

As a final check, the package can be installed and ran:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ sudo dnf -C -y install ./results_banner/1.3.6/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/banner-1.3.6-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
$ banner success

\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;   \&#35;     \&#35;   \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;   \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;   \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;

\&#35;  \&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;        \&#35;        \&#35;              \&#35;        \&#35;
\&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;        \&#35;     \&#35;  \&#35;     \&#35;
\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;   \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;   \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;    \&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35;\&#35; ..
----

To clean up your system, undo the installation:

----
$ sudo dnf -C -y history undo last
----

== Building in Fedora infrastructure

Even though the package is not part of Fedora distribution yet,
a xref:Using_the_Koji_Build_System.adoc\&#35;scratch_builds[scratch build] can be performed
to ensure that the package builds successfully in Fedora's Koji build system,
and that it builds successfully for all architectures supported by Fedora.
Such build is started by passing a source rpm package to \&#96;fedpkg scratch-build\&#96;.

Note that Koji uses Kerberos for authentication.
See xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc\&#35;kerberos_ticket[Acquiring Kerberos Ticket] for details.

= Packaging Tutorial 2: GNU Hello
:page-aliases: Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello.adoc

This tutorial demonstrates RPM packaging
by packaging the https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/[GNU Hello] program.
While the program itself is simple,
it also comes with many peripheral components of a FOSS project:
configuration/build/install environment, documentation, internationalization,etc.

This tutorial is the second part of Fedora packaging tutorial.
It follows the same basic structure as xref:Packaging_Tutorial_1_banner.adoc[part 1].
If you have not completed it yet, please do so before continuing with this tutorial.

The steps in this part are similar to part 1.
However, GNU Hello has more quirks than Banner does, so some workarounds and custom steps are needed.
Each package's quirks are unique,
so these are best viewed as examples of the kind of problems that may arise when packaging.

[\&#35;dev_env]
== Installing Packager Tools

Follow xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools].

[\&#35;building]
== Creating the package directory

For GNU Hello, the package can simply be named \&#96;hello\&#96;.
This is also the name of Fedora's https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/hello/hello/[official GNU Hello package].

----
$ mkdir hello \&amp;\&amp; cd hello
----

[\&#35;inside_spec]
== Inside a Spec File

Create a file called \&#96;hello.spec\&#96; and paste the following minimal specfile.
This already has \&#96;BuildRequires\&#96; tags for \&#96;gcc\&#96; and \&#96;make\&#96;,
since that topic was already covered in part 1.
Similarly, \&#96;%files\&#96; section already includes the resulting binary, man pages, documentation and license file.
For GNU Hello, all these files are very similar to corresponding files in Banner,
and were thus already covered in part 1.

Also, for reasons that are too complex to explain in a tutorial,
in some situations \&#96;texinfo\&#96; package is also needed,
and so a \&#96;BuildRequires\&#96; line is added for it.

== Downloading source

Download sources and check that you now have them:

----
$ spectool -g hello.spec
$ ls \&#42;.tar.gz
hello-2.10.tar.gz
----

== Building the Package

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg --release f{MAJOROSVER} mockbuild
----

This command fails because of unpackaged files.

== Installing files

As in part 1, we will go through the file list one by one.
Run \&#96;fedpkg --release f{MAJOROSVER} mockbuild\&#96; again after each change to see the progress.

=== Texinfo pages

----
Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
/usr/share/info/dir
/usr/share/info/hello.info.gz
----

These are https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/[Texinfo] pages.
Texinfo is a documentation system like man pages, but much less common.
Texinfo pages are handled much in the same way as man pages.
The directory is defined by the default macro \&#96;+{_infodir}+\&#96;,
so the Texinfo manual can be added as follows:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%files
⋮
%{_infodir}/hello.info.\&#42;
----

The \&#96;+dir+\&#96; file generated by GNU Hello build script indexes all texinfo pages in your system.
Because the installed pages differ among systems, the file cannot be prebuilt and packaged.
Instead it needs to be created and updated when the package is installed.
The update is automatically performed by RPM triggers in \&#96;+info+\&#96; binary package of
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/texinfo[texinfo source package].

To prevent from installing the \&#96;dir\&#96; file,
remove it from the _buildroot_ at the end of the \&#96;%install\&#96; section with \&#96;rm\&#96; command.

However, GNU Hello build script only generates the \&#96;dir\&#96; file
if \&#96;info\&#96; package is installed during the build.
Blindly removing the file would raise an error if
the \&#96;hello\&#96; package were built on a system without \&#96;info\&#96; package.
To handle both cases, delete the file if it exists:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%install
⋮
test -f %{buildroot}/%{_infodir}/dir \&amp;\&amp; rm %{buildroot}/%{_infodir}/dir
----

=== Translations

----
Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
/usr/share/locale/bg/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
/usr/share/locale/ca/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
/usr/share/locale/da/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
⋮
----

Since our program uses translations and internationalization,
we are seeing a lot of undeclared i18n files.
The xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;handling_locale_files[recommended method]
to declare them is:

. Add the required build dependency with \&#96;+BuildRequires: gettext+\&#96;.
. Find the filenames in the \&#96;+%install+\&#96; step with \&#96;+%find_lang %{name}+\&#96;.
. Install the files with \&#96;+%files -f %{name}.lang+\&#96;.

After these changes, build succeeds.

== Running tests

GNU Hello, like many other projects,
includes an automated test suite in the sources.
If at all possible,
the test suite should be run during the rpm build.
This helps ensuring that a working build was produced.
This is done by adding the test suite invocation
to specfile \&#96;+%check%+\&#96; section,
which comes after \&#96;+%install+\&#96; in order.
In GNU Hello's case:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%check
make check
----

Run a mockbuild again
and check the output to ensure that the tests were actually run.
Something like this should be somewhere in the output:

----
============================================================================
Testsuite summary for GNU Hello 2.10
============================================================================
\&#35; TOTAL: 5
\&#35; PASS:  4
\&#35; SKIP:  1
\&#35; XFAIL: 0
\&#35; FAIL:  0
\&#35; XPASS: 0
\&#35; ERROR: 0
============================================================================
----

== Fixing automagic ==

Now the package successfully builds.
But that does not mean that the \&#96;.spec\&#96; file is correct.

=== Listing all build-time dependencies ===

If you carefully read a build output,
you can discover lines which mention \&#96;sed\&#96; command:

----
+ /usr/bin/make -O -j4 V=1 VERBOSE=1
rm -f lib/arg-nonnull.h-t lib/arg-nonnull.h \&amp;\&amp; \
sed -n -e '/GL_ARG_NONNULL/,$p' \
----

Therefore you need to add this line close to other BuildRequires lines:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
BuildRequires:  sed
----

Similarly, studying \&#96;configure\&#96; script in the unpackaged sources,
which is executed by \&#96;%configure\&#96; macro,
reveals it's a \&#96;/bin/sh\&#96; script:

----
$ head configure
\&#35;! /bin/sh
\&#35; Guess values for system-dependent variables and create Makefiles.
\&#35; Generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69 for GNU Hello 2.10.
----

Thus you also should record this dependency on \&#96;bash\&#96;:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----
BuildRequires:  bash
----

Why on \&#96;bash\&#96;?
Because \&#96;/bin/sh\&#96; program is provided by \&#96;bash\&#96; package:

----
$ rpm --queryformat '%{name}\n' --query --file /bin/sh
bash
----

Specifying all used dependencies helps
to make the \&#96;.spec\&#96; file resilient against changes in the build environment.
If e.g. \&#96;sed\&#96; package were removed from the environment,
this GNU Hello package would fail to build.

=== Listing all build options ===

The GNU Hello build script, \&#96;configure\&#96; has many build options
which enable or disable optional features.
Their nondefault forms can be listed with \&#96;--help\&#96; option:

----
$ ./configure --help
\&#96;configure' configures GNU Hello 2.10 to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]\&#8230; [VAR=VALUE]\&#8230;
⋮
Optional Features:
--disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
--disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
--enable-silent-rules   less verbose build output (undo: 'make V=1')
--disable-silent-rules  verbose build output (undo: 'make V=0')
--enable-dependency-tracking
do not reject slow dependency extractors
--disable-dependency-tracking
speeds up one-time build
--disable-nls           do not use Native Language Support
--disable-rpath         do not hardcode runtime library paths
----

Some of them are already specified within \&#96;%configure\&#96; and \&#96;%make_build\&#96;
macros. The rest of the options, if they are important for the built package,
should be explicitly written in the \&#96;.spec\&#96; file to prevent from their
sudden and unnoticed changes. Either because a new Hello version changes the
default, or because a package which they depend on appears of disappears from
the build environment.

Therefore modify \&#96;%configure\&#96; invocation in \&#96;%build\&#96; section like this:


[source,_rpm-spec]
----
%configure --enable-nls --disable-rpath
----

== Checking the result with rpmlint

Check with \&#96;fedpkg lint\&#96; reveals a problem:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg --release f{MAJOROSVER} lint
hello.x86_64: W: file-not-utf8 /usr/share/doc/hello/THANKS
----

In order to ensure a pure utf-8 installation, the file needs to be converted in \&#96;%prep\&#96;.
This can be done with the \&#96;iconv\&#96; utility which is provided by \&#96;glibc-common\&#96; package,
and \&#96;mv\&#96; tool from \&#96;coreutils\&#96;:

----
BuildRequires:  coreutils
BuildRequires:  glibc-common
⋮
%prep
⋮
mv THANKS THANKS.old
iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 --output=THANKS THANKS.old
----

Run \&#96;fedpkg lint\&#96; again and observe that the warning is fixed.

== A Complete hello.spec File

Here is the final version of \&#96;hello.spec\&#96;:

[source,_rpm-spec]
----

With this \&#96;.spec\&#96; file,
you should be able to successfully complete the build process,
and create the source and binary RPM packages.

== Checking the result

You can now check the result with \&#96;rpm\&#96;, like was done in part 1.

=== Files

List the files contained in the package:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ rpm --query --package --list results_hello/2.10/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/hello-2.10-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
/usr/bin/hello
/usr/lib/.build-id

/usr/share/locale/bg/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
⋮
/usr/share/locale/zh_TW/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
/usr/share/man/man1/hello.1.gz
----

You can see that all the files listed in the specfile \&#96;%files\&#96; section are included,
including the automatically processed locale files.
Also the \&#96;.build-id\&#96; file is there, just like in part 1.

=== Requires and Provides

You can list list the package's runtime dependencies and the capabilities it provides
with the following two commands.
The output is similar to corresponding output in part 1.

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ rpm --query --package --requires results_hello/2.10/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/hello-2.10-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
$ rpm --query --package --provides results_hello/2.10/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/hello-2.10-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
----

=== Installing

As a final check, the package can be installed and ran:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ sudo dnf -C -y install ./results_hello/2.10/1.fc{MAJOROSVER}/hello-2.10-1.fc{MAJOROSVER}.x86_64.rpm
$ hello --greeting='Hello, rpm!'
Hello, rpm!
----

To clean up your system, undo the installation:

----
$ sudo dnf -C -y history undo last

= Package Review Process

In order for a new package to be added to Fedora,
the package must first undertake a formal review.
The process is governed by the FESCo approved xref:fesco::Package_review_policy.adoc[Package Review Policy].

[\&#35;review_process]
== Review Process

There are two roles in the review process,
that of the contributor and that of the reviewer.
This document presents both perspectives.

[\&#35;exemptions]
=== Exemptions

Certain packages are exempted from the review process
as described in the xref:fesco::Package_review_policy.adoc\&#35;what[Applicability section of Package Review Policy].
If an exemption is warranted,
the contributor can directly request a repository for the package.
The request to create a repo should include the \&#96;--exception\&#96; flag
instead of a bug number:
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-repo --exception \&lt;package_name\&gt;
\&#8230;.

=== Contributor

A Contributor is defined as someone who wants to submit
(and maintain)
a new package in Fedora.
To become a contributor,
you must follow the detailed instructions to xref:Joining_the_Package_Maintainers.adoc[Joining the Package Maintainers].

As a Contributor, you should have already made a package
which adheres to the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Packaging Guidelines]
and does not contain any https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items[Forbidden Items].

When you're happy with your spec file,
you should then submit that SRPM to a package review.
Currently, this is done by following these steps:

\&#42; Put your spec file and SRPM somewhere on the Internet
where it can be directly downloaded
(just http(s), no registration pages or special download methods, please).
If you have no place to put your spec and SRPM,
use https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[copr].

\&#42; Fill out a https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora\&amp;format=fedora-review[request for review in bugzilla].
Make absolutely certain to file this bug
with an account tied to your FAS email address,
otherwise your followup requests will be closed as invalid.

TIP: If nobody comments on your review request,
you might want to mail to a mailing list (for example, devel)
or the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/workflows/pkg-review-swap/91[Package Review Swaps category] on Fedora Discussion
to ask for a 'review swap'.
This is an offer to do a review of someone else's package
in exchange for them reviewing your package.
This is usually one-for-one,
or can be some other private arrangement
depending on the difficulty of the respective packages.

\&#42; If you are not member of the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/packager/[packager] group, you need a sponsor.
Add https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=FE-NEEDSPONSOR[FE-NEEDSPONSOR] to the bugs being blocked by your review request.
For more information read xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[How to Get Sponsored into the Packager Group].

\&#42; If this is a 're-review' request needed to xref:Package_Retirement_Process.adoc\&#35;claiming[claim ownership]
of a retired package, add \&#96;Unretirement\&#96; to the _Whiteboard_ field.

\&#42; Wait for someone to review your package!
At this point in the process, the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag is blank,
meaning that no reviewer is assigned.

\&#42; There may be comments from people that are not formally reviewing the package,
they may add \&#96;NotReady\&#96; to the _Whiteboard_ field,
indication that the review request is not yet ready,
because of some issues they report.
After you have addressed them,
please post the URLs to the updated SPEC and SRPM file
and clear the Whiteboard.
It is expected that you will respond to commentary,
including updating your submission to address it;
if you do not, your ticket will be closed.

\&#42; A reviewer takes on the task of reviewing your package.
They will set the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag to \&#96;?\&#96;.

\&#42; The reviewer will review your package.
You should fix any blockers that the reviewer identifies.
Once the reviewer is happy with the package,
the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag will be set to \&#96;+\&#96;,
indicating that the package has passed review.

\&#42; If you have not yet been sponsored,
request sponsorship by https://pagure.io/packager-sponsors/issues[raising an issue at packager-sponsors].

\&#42; When your package passes the review
you should use \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; to request a Git repository for it.
Before you can request a Git repository for the package,
you will need a https://pagure.io/settings/token/new[pagure.io api token]
with _Create a new ticket_ ACL
added into \&#96;~/.config/rpkg/fedpkg.conf\&#96;:
+
\&#8230;.
[fedpkg.pagure]
token = \&lt;generated_code\&gt;
\&#8230;.

\&#42; Request a Git repository for the package.
For example, if the package name is \&#96;my-package\&#96;
and the bugzilla review ticket is 12345,
:
+
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-repo my-package 12345
\&#8230;.
+
Check that your review bug is valid.
It must have the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; set to \&#96;+\&#96;,
and it must be assigned to your reviewer.
Otherwise your repository request will be closed as invalid.

\&#42; If you want to add your package to more Fedora releases
and not just Rawhide,
see xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc\&#35;requesting_branches[Requesting branches].

\&#42; When https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-scm-requests/issues[fedora-scm-requests tickets]
for the requested repository and branches are closed,
checkout the package:
+
\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone
\&#8230;.

\&#42; Now you can xref:New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors.adoc\&#35;import_commit_and_build_your_package[import your SRPM package].
Do a final check of spec file tags, etc.

\&#42; Request a Koji build by running \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;.
(You will need to set up https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Kerberos[Kerberos for Fedora project])

\&#42; Repeat the process for other branches you may have requested above:
\&#42;\&#42; Checkout given branch: \&#96;fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96;
\&#42;\&#42; Let Koji build the package for this branch: \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;

\&#42; Request updates for Fedora release branches, if necessary,
using \&#96;fedpkg update\&#96;
or another Bodhi interface as detailed in https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi[Bodhi].

\&#42; If possible, add your package to xref:Upstream_Release_Monitoring.adoc[Upstream Release Monitoring].

\&#42; To be notified if your package stops building successfully
when dependencies are updated in Fedora,
you can enable https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koschei[Koschei].

\&#42; You should make sure the review ticket is closed.
You are welcome to close it
once the package has been built on the requested branches.
If you built for one of the Fedora release branches
you can ask Bodhi to close the ticket for you
when it completes the process.
If you close the ticket yourself, use \&#96;NEXTRELEASE\&#96; as the resolution.

You do not need to go through the review process again
for subsequent package changes,
and should not reference the review ticket in subsequent updates
you create in Bodhi.

=== Reviewer

The Reviewer is the person who chooses to review a package.

The Reviewer can be any Fedora account holder
who is a member of the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/packager/[packager group].
(If the Contributor is not yet sponsored,
the review can still proceed to completion
but they will need to find a sponsor at some point.)

\&#42; Search https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/[Package Review Tracker] for a review request
that needs a reviewer: \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag is blank or the bug is assigned to \&#96;nobody@fedoraproject.org\&#96;.

\&#42; If you notice some issues that need to be solved
before you want to start a formal review,
add these issues in a comment
and set the _Whiteboard_ of the bug to contain \&#96;NotReady\&#96;.
This helps other possible reviewers
to notice that the review request is not yet ready for further review action.

\&#42; If you want to formally review the package,
set the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag to \&#96;?\&#96;
and assign the bug to yourself.

\&#42; Review the package

\&#42;\&#42; Go through the MUST items listed in xref:packaging-guidelines::ReviewGuidelines.adoc[Review Guidelines] .

\&#42;\&#42; Go through the SHOULD items in xref:packaging-guidelines::ReviewGuidelines.adoc[Review Guidelines] .

\&#42;\&#42; The https://pagure.io/FedoraReview[FedoraReview] tool
(packaged as \&#96;fedora-review\&#96;)
can help to automate this process.

\&#42; Include the text of your review in a comment in the ticket.
For easy readability, simply use a regular comment
instead of an attachment.

\&#42; Take one of the following actions:
\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;ACCEPT\&#42; - If the package is good, set the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag to \&#96;+\&#96;.
Do not close the review ticket yet - this will be done by the submitter
once the package becomes available in Fedora.

\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;FAIL, LEGAL\&#42; - If the package is legally risky for whatever reason
(known patent or copyright infringement, trademark concerns)
close the bug as \&#96;WONTFIX\&#96;
and leave an appropriate comment
(i.e. _we don't ship mp3, so stop submitting it_).
Set the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag to \&#96;-\&#96;,
and have the review ticket block https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=FE-Legal[FE-Legal].

\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;FAIL, OTHER\&#42; - If the package is just way off
or unsuitable for some other reason,
and there is no simple fix,
then close the bug as \&#96;WONTFIX\&#96;
and leave an appropriate comment
(i.e. _we don't package pornography for redistribution, sorry._
Or, _this isn't a specfile, it's a McDonald's menu, sorry._)
Set the \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; flag to \&#96;-\&#96;.

\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;NEEDSWORK\&#42; - Anything that isn't explicitly failed should be left open
while the submitter and reviewer work together to fix any potential issues.
Mark the bug as \&#96;NEEDINFO\&#96;
while waiting for the reviewer to respond to improvement requests.
This makes it easier for reviewers to find open reviews
which require their input.

\&#42; Once a package is flagged as \&#96;fedora-review +\&#96; (or \&#96;-\&#96;),
the Reviewer's job is done
although they may be called upon to assist the Contributor
with the import/build/update process
and to ensure that the Contributor closes the ticket
when the process is complete.

[\&#35;the_whiteboard]
== The Whiteboard

To save time for reviewers,
the https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/reviewable.html[New, reviewable Fedora package review tickets] page
will hide certain tickets which are not reviewable.
The _Whiteboard_ field can be used
to mark a ticket with various additional bits of status
which will cause it to be hidden
or displayed differently.

[cols=',',]
|===
|NotReady |The package is not yet ready for review. It is possible to open a review ticket, mark it as NotReady, and continue to work on it until it's ready to be seen by a reviewer.
|BuildFails |The package fails to build.

|Trivial |The package is trivial to review. See below.
|Unretirement |A re-review needed to xref:Package_Retirement_Process.adoc\&#35;claiming[claim ownership] of a retired package .
|===

The \&#96;Trivial\&#96; status is intended to indicate packages which,
as an aid to new reviewers,
are especially uncomplicated and easy to review.
A ticket should not be marked as being trivial unless:

\&#42; The package is known to build
and a link to a scratch build is included.

\&#42; The ticket explains any rpmlint output which is present.

\&#42; The spec contains nothing which is unnecessary in modern Fedora
(such as \&#96;BuildRoot:\&#96;, a \&#96;%clean\&#96; section or \&#96;%defattr\&#96;).

\&#42; The spec is free from excessive or complicated macro usage.

\&#42; The spec uses only the least complicated scriptlets
which are taken directly from the xref:packaging-guidelines::Scriptlets.adoc[Scriptlets] page.

\&#42; The package contains no daemons.

\&#42; The package is not especially security sensitive.

\&#42; The code has undergone a thorough inspection for licensing issues.
Anomalies which would be found by \&#96;licensecheck\&#96; should be explained.

In short, this should be reserved only for those tickets
which should be easily approachable
by someone doing their first package review.

[\&#35;tracking_of_package_requests]
== Tracking of Package Requests

The https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/[Package Review Tracker] provides various review-related reports
and a simple way to search for reviews
by package name or reporter name or others.



= Package Renaming Process

For a variety of reasons it may become necessary to rename a package in Fedora.
The goal of this page is to outline the process
that must be followed
when such an event occurs.

[\&#35;re_review_required]
== Re-review required

When you wish to rename a package,
you \&#42;MUST\&#42; request a re-review of your package through the xref:Package_Review_Process.adoc[Package Review Process].
In this review request,
you \&#42;MUST\&#42; state that this is a re-review request for a package rename,
and the old package name that this is replacing.

The reviewer of the package \&#42;MUST\&#42; explicitly acknowledge this fact,
and check the package for the proper Obsoletes and Provides
(see xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;renaming-or-replacing-existing-packages[relevant Packaging Guidelines] for more information.)
They \&#42;MUST\&#42; document in the review request that they have done so.

[\&#35;after_the_review]
== After the review

After the review is completed, and is satisfactory
(for the avoidance of doubt,
the lack of a clean upgrade path for users of the package
in the form of proper Provides and Obsoletes
is considered a blocker to the review),
request git for the package
as you normally would for a new package.

After the new package is imported into git,
you can follow the xref:Package_Retirement_Process.adoc[Package Retirement Process] for the old package.



= Package Orphaning Process

This page contains instructions for working with orphan packages
as specified in xref:fesco::Policy_for_orphan_and_retired_packages.adoc[Policy for Orphan and Retired Packages].

[\&#35;orphaning_procedure]
== Orphaning Procedure

. (Optional) If the package has co-maintainers, contact them
to ask whether one of them wants to take over ownership of the package.
+
The current list of maintainers can be found in the _Users \&amp; Groups_ tab
of the setting for the package repo.
The URL will look something like this:
\&#96;\https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/PACKAGE_NAME/settings.\&#96;
+
If somebody wants to take the package,
skip the rest of the procedure and give it to them as follows:

.. Remove yourself under _Users and Groups_,
unless you want to remain as a co-maintainer.

.. Reset your watch status,
unless you still want to be notified about new package bugs.

. Click the _✋ Orphan_ button on the left, fill requested information, and click _Update_.

. Announce on the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel mailing list]
which package you orphaned,
so that others have a chance to take over as maintainer.

After completing these steps, the package is orphaned.
Package's open bug reports are automatically assigned to the orphan user,
\&#96;extras-orphan@fedoraproject.org\&#96;.
If nobody takes over the orphan package in six weeks,
it is automatically retired by https://docs.pagure.org/releng/[Release Engineering].

[\&#35;claiming_ownership_of_an_orphaned_package]
== Claiming Ownership of an Orphaned Package

Ownership of an orphaned package can be claimed
by any interested packager at any time.
They then become responsible for the package.

. Check why the package was orphaned
by checking the note on the left menu of the package's main page
at https://src.fedoraproject.org/[Package Sources],
and looking for the email at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel].

. Announce on https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel]
which packages you want to take over.

. Log in to https://src.fedoraproject.org/[Package Sources].
On the page with the orphaned package,
click the _✋ Take_ button in the left column.
If the button does not work,
https://pagure.io/releng/new_issue?template=package_unorphan\&amp;title=Unorphan%20%3Cpkgname%3E[submit a ticket to the Release Engineering team],
stating which package you want to claim
and that the button did not work.

All open bug reports for the package in Bugzilla are automatically reassigned to you.

If you are not in the packager group yet,
but want to claim ownership of an orphaned package,
you must xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[Get Sponsored into the Packager Group] first.

[\&#35;lists_of_orphan_and_retired_packages]
== Lists of Orphan and Retired Packages

\&#42; https://packager-dashboard.fedoraproject.org/user/orphan[A list of currently orphaned and/or retired packages]




= Package Retirement Process

When a package reaches the end of its useful life,
the Package Retirement Process lets other people
— and automated processes! —
know both not to expect any more releases,
and why it was removed.
The process is governed by xref:fesco::Policy_for_orphan_and_retired_packages.adoc[Policy for Orphan and Retired Packages].

A common situation that involves, among other tasks, retiring a package is
renaming a package, or replacing it with another that provides compatible functionality.
For handing such situation, see
xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;renaming-or-replacing-existing-packages[the relevant packaging guidelines].

[\&#35;what_can_be_retired]
== What can be retired ==

Packages can normally only be retired in the following branches:

\&#42; xref:releases::rawhide.adoc[Rawhide]
\&#42; xref:releases::branched.adoc[Branched] (until the Final Freeze)
\&#42; EPEL branches (\&#96;epel7\&#96;, \&#96;epel8\&#96;, \&#96;epel9\&#96;, and the corresponding \&#96;-next\&#96;
branches) - see
xref:epel::epel-policy-retirement.adoc[EPEL
Retirement Policy] for additional requirements

== Procedure

Please execute the following steps in the order indicated.

=== RPM

If the package is being replaced by some other package,
ensure that the \&#96;Obsoletes\&#96;/\&#96;Provides\&#96; tags are properly set by the new package
as specified in xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;renaming-or-replacing-existing-packages[Renaming/Replacing Guidelines].

=== Git

Run \&#96;fedpkg retire DESCRIPTION\&#96; in Rawhide.
\&#96;DESCRIPTION\&#96; should explain why the package was retired.
Examples of good messages are _Obsoleted by \&lt;new package\&gt;_ and _Renamed to \&lt;new package\&gt;_.

\&#96;fedpkg retire\&#96; removes all files from the branch,
adds file \&#96;dead.package\&#96; that contains \&#96;DESCRIPTION\&#96;,
and pushes the changes.

If Branched currently exists and Final Freeze has not started yet,
prevent the package from being released by merging (or cherry-picking, etc.) the retirement commit into that branch.
It is not necessary to run \&#96;fedpkg retire\&#96; separately for Branched.

Do not run \&#96;fedpkg retire\&#96; or merge a retirement commit for any supported or end-of-life Fedora release branch.
Packages must not be retired from stable releases.

If the package is included in EPEL, consider also xref:epel::epel-policy-retirement.adoc[EPEL Retirement policy].

[\&#35;obsoleting_packages]
=== fedora-obsolete-packages

Consider what will happen to systems which have the now-retired packages installed.
Generally, such packages will simply remain on the system as it is updated,
becoming increasingly outdated.
If this is not acceptable, such as if there are upgrade path issues or security concerns,
add your package to https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-obsolete-packages/[fedora-obsolete-packages].

=== Comps

Remove the package from https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_and_edit_comps.xml_for_package_groups[comps] if it is listed.

=== Spins

Remove the package from any https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts[spin kickstart file].

=== Koji

To keep retired packages from being pushed to the mirrors,
they need to be blocked in Koji.
This will happen automatically during the next compose
(for rawhide, the branched release and for EPEL).

You can check whether a package is blocked in koji
with \&#96;koji list-pkgs --show-blocked\&#96;.
There should an entry with \&#96;[BLOCKED]\&#96;
for each branch the package was retired in.
It is enough for a package to be blocked in an older tag
to be also blocked in a newer tag
due to inheritance. Example output:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
$ koji list-pkgs  --show-blocked --tag f{MAJOROSVER} --package curry
Package                 Tag                     Extra Arches     Owner
----------------------- ----------------------- ---------------- ---------------
curry                   f{PREVIOUSOSVER}                                      gemi            [BLOCKED]
\&#8230;.

Please wait for two days to allow for a compose to happen
and mirrors to be updated.
If the package is not blocked automatically after two days,
please file a https://forge.fedoraproject.org/releng/tickets/issues/new[ticket for release engineering]
and mention package names
and the branches where the packages need to be blocked.
Use only one ticket for all the packages you retired at once,
do not open one ticket for each package if you retired several packages.

== EPEL

The retirement process can be used for EPEL as well
with one difference:

\&#42; You can remove the package from any EPEL branch
whether or not it has been released.

For example, if your package has been added to base RHEL in
RHEL-{MAJOREPELVER}.4
then perform the steps above
but use the \&#96;el{MAJOREPELVER}\&#96; branch instead of \&#96;rawhide\&#96;.

When you need to add package from EPEL to any RHEL release,
only retire EPEL branch when package is released in that RHEL release.

[\&#35;claiming]
== Claiming Ownership of a Retired Package

If you really want to maintain a retired package,
you need to be aware that if upstream is dead,
fixing release critical bugs, etc
becomes your responsibility.
This is to ensure the high quality and standards of packaging
remain for Fedora package collection.
There may be additional issues with retired packages.
If possible, consult with the former maintainer for more information.
The process is a bit different from unorphaning a package.

. See if you can figure out why the package was retired
including searching for information about orphaned packages on https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel mailing list]
or emailing the former maintainer.
You can also check \&#96;dead.package\&#96; in the SCM
(url like: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/system-config-network/blob/rawhide/f/dead.package[https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/\&#42;\&#42;package_name_here\&#42;\&#42;/blob/rawhide/f/dead.package])

. Announce on https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel]
which packages you would like to become the owner of.

. Retired Fedora packages (rawhide branch retired) require a re-review
if they are retired for more than eight weeks
or if there is no previous review of the package.
Submit a review request (a new bugzilla ticket)
and have the package approved by a reviewer
as if it were new to Fedora.
See the xref:Package_Review_Process.adoc[Package Review Process] for more information.
To unretire a EPEL branch if the package is still in Fedora,
no re-review is required.

. Request unretirement by filing a https://forge.fedoraproject.org/releng/tickets/issues/new?template=.forgejo%2fISSUE_TEMPLATE%2funretire-package.md[releng ticket].
Specify all branches that need to be un-retired
(including \&#96;rawhide\&#96; for Rawhide, unless it is for EPEL only)
and include the link to re-review.
In this ticket,
request that the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/[Release Engineering team] unblock the package
for the releases that the package should be un-retired for.
In this request,
clearly specify which branches should be unblocked.

. Restore the contents in Git and prepare a new build and update (if necessary).

[\&#35;complete_removal]
== Completely Removing a Package

In rare cases, such as when licensing issues are discovered,
it may be necessary to completely remove a package from Fedora.
This differs from normal retirement
in that the package is removed also from stable and end-of-life releases.

For complete removal, first follow the xref:Procedure[procedure for normal removal].

Additionally, retire the package in '''all''' dist-git branches.
Since \&#96;fedpkg retire\&#96; refuses to work on stable branches,
simulate it with the following:
\&#8230;.
$ DESC='my description'; git rm -r . \&amp;\&amp; echo '$DESC' \&gt; dead.package \&amp;\&amp; git add dead.package \&amp;\&amp; git commit -m '$DESC'
\&#8230;.

Finally, add the package to fedora-obsolete-packages.




= Package Maintenance Guide

This page provides some basic instructions for day-to-day usage
of the https://git-scm.com/[git]-based package maintenance system for Fedora.
It is intended primarily for new and current Fedora package maintainers,
but does briefly xref:using_fedpkg_anonymously[cover anonymous read-only use of the system].
It is not a guide to RPM packaging per se.

Some pre-existing knowledge of git may be useful,
but is not a pre-requisite.
In fact, Fedora packaging can be a relatively painless introduction to it.

You may have been looking for, or also be interested in:

[\&#35;common_fedpkg_commands]
== Common fedpkg commands

This section lists typical fedpkg commands in a normal workflow,
with short descriptions.
In this workflow,
we will be operating on the xref:releases::rawhide.adoc[Rawhide] branch of the package.

=== Check out a package
\&#8230;.
fedpkg co \&lt;source_package_name\&gt;
cd \&lt;source_package_name\&gt;
\&#8230;.

This retrieves a copy of the package sources from the server.
It's known as your 'working copy'.

=== Update your checked-out copy from the Fedora server
\&#8230;.
fedpkg pull
\&#8230;.

=== Retrieve package sources
\&#8230;.
fedpkg sources
\&#8230;.

This pulls any sources stored in the 'lookaside cache'
(see below for more).
Steps like \&#96;fedpkg prep\&#96; and \&#96;fedpkg srpm\&#96; will do this if necessary,
but you may want a copy right away.

=== Make your changes to the package

This is not an RPM packaging guide,
so we'll assume you know what you're doing here.
New sources and patches go in the working copy directory for now.

=== Run the prep stage
Extract source, apply patches etc. within the checkout directory:
\&#8230;.
fedpkg prep
\&#8230;.

This is useful for making sure your patches apply cleanly,
and inspecting the source tree if you need to do so.

=== Do a local build of the current state
\&#8230;.
fedpkg local
\&#8230;.

This is the simplest kind of test build,
but it's usually cleaner and a better test
to do a Mock or Koji scratch build (see below).

=== Do a mock build of the current state
\&#8230;.
fedpkg mockbuild
\&#8230;.

This fires off a https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/[Mock] build, if you have Mock configured correctly.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Mock_to_test_package_builds[Using Mock to Test Package Builds] can help there.

=== Generate a .src.rpm from the current state
\&#8230;.
fedpkg srpm
\&#8230;.

You can request a Koji _scratch build_
(a test build, which will not go to any repository)
of the generated .src.rpm
with the \&#96;koji build --scratch\&#96; command (see \&#96;man koji\&#96;).

=== Do a scratch build using Koji

See xref:Using_the_Koji_Build_System\&#35;scratch_builds[Koji scratch builds].

=== Check changes you have made
\&#8230;.
fedpkg diff
\&#8230;.

This is handy for making sure you did not touch something by mistake,
or forget to bump the release,
or forget to include a changelog.

=== Run some checks (rpmlint) on your package
\&#8230;.
fedpkg lint
\&#8230;.

If you want to whitelist some rpmlint errors
and prevent them from appearing,
you can create an rpmlint config file named \&#96;\&lt;source_package_name\&gt;.rpmlintrc\&#96;
and it will get applied.

=== Stage any small patches or new source files for commit
\&#8230;.
git add \&lt;file\&gt;\&#8230;
\&#8230;.

Git does not consider all files in the working directory
to be a part of the git repository by default
(handy for keeping other files around that are relevant,
like the source tree).
This tells git to start considering these files as part of the repository locally.
When you \&#96;commit\&#96; and \&#96;push\&#96; later,
this change is communicated to the server.

[\&#35;upload_new_source_files]
=== Upload new source files to the lookaside cache
\&#8230;.
fedpkg new-sources \&lt;file\&gt;\&#8230;
\&#8230;.

Replace current list of source files.

\&#8230;.
fedpkg upload \&lt;file\&gt;\&#8230;
\&#8230;.

Append to current list of source files.

'Pristine' upstream sources (like release tarballs)
and other larger source files
are stored in the lookaside cache system,
not committed directly to git.
This provides more efficient storage and transfer of the files.
The sources and \&#96;.gitignore\&#96; files in the repository keep it in sync with the lookaside cache.

A valid xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc\&#35;kerberos_ticket[Kerberos ticket] is required to upload source files.
Any time you use upload new sources, remember to commit changes to \&#96;sources\&#96; file.

=== Switch to a different release branch
[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg switch-branch (f{MAJOROSVER} | el{MAJOREPELVER} | rawhide)
\&#8230;.

Each Fedora release has its own branch in each package repository
so different builds can be sent to each release.
See below for more details on working with branches.

=== Generate git changelog from package changelog
\&#8230;.
fedpkg clog
\&#8230;.

This command extracts your package changelog entry to the file \&#96;clog\&#96;,
so you can use it as the git changelog if you like.
Some maintainers draw a distinction between the two,
some do not.

=== Commit changes
\&#8230;.
fedpkg commit [-F \&lt;clog\&gt;] [-p] [-c]
\&#8230;.

This behaves by default like \&#96;git commit -a\&#96;:
It stages modified files and commits all at once,
though it does not add files which git is not yet tracking.

This creates a sort of bundle,
a 'commit', of your changes to the repository,
with a unique identity and a changelog.
Other maintainers — and you yourself, later —
can view the history of changes to the repository
with the commit as the finest level of detail.
It is good practice to use many relatively small commits,
each for a single purpose.
Do not combine a version bump
with a bunch of whitespace fixes and some scriptlet changes
all in one commit,
create separate commits for each.

The \&#96;-F clog\&#96; parameter will use the \&#96;clog\&#96; file from the previous step as the changelog.
\&#96;-p\&#96; will push (see below) at the same time as committing.
\&#96;-c\&#96; combines the clog and \&#96;commit -F clog\&#96; steps into one, if you like that.

=== Push changes
\&#8230;.
fedpkg push
\&#8230;.

This sends all the new commits in your local working copy to the upstream server.
If you are still learning the system,
now is a good time to \&#96;fedpkg co\&#96; another copy of the repository somewhere else,
compare what you get to your working copy,
and run a test build on it.

=== Do an 'official' build of the latest pushed changes
\&#8230;.
fedpkg build
\&#8230;.

=== Do a Container Layered Image Build
\&#8230;.
fedpkg container-build
\&#8230;.

See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Layered_Docker_Image_Build_Service[Container Layered Image Build] for details.

=== Submit a package update for the latest build
\&#8230;.
fedpkg update
\&#8230;.

CAUTION: This is the first point at which you might possibly cause real mess for a real user,
so use it with caution.
If you are following the example and operating on Rawhide,
your build would go live for Rawhide users
some few hours after you ran this command.

Unlike most of the above commands,
this operates on the state you have pushed to git,
not the local state.
If you have issues
make sure you have pushed and committed all patches
and handled the sources correctly.

See xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc\&#35;updating_inter_dependent_packages[Updating inter-dependent packages]
if you are making inter-dependent changes
to more than one package.

[\&#35;typical_fedpkg_session]
== Typical fedpkg session

A typical session may look like this:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone foo
cd foo
fedpkg sources
fedpkg new-sources foo-0.0.2.tar.bz2
\&#35; Change the required things in the specfile.
\&#35; 'rpmdev-bumpspec' is useful for simple version updates.
gedit foo.spec
\&#35; Check that the changes you made are correct.
fedpkg mockbuild
fedpkg diff
fedpkg lint
fedpkg commit -p -c  \&#35; commit and push in one go
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;working_with_branches]
== Working with branches

Each Fedora and xref:epel::index.adoc[EPEL] release
has a corresponding branch in the git repository.
You can switch between them like this:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg switch-branch rawhide
fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
fedpkg switch-branch f{PREVIOUSOSVER}
fedpkg switch-branch epel{MAJOREPELVER}
\&#8230;.

When the git repository is created,
it will only have a \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch and a \&#96;main\&#96; branch,
the latter being an alias to the former.
Branches for new Fedora releases going forward are created automatically during
xref:infra:release_guide:sop_mass_branching.adoc[mass branching].
If you would like to build your package for existing releases of Fedora or EPEL,
you will need to explictly request those branches.

[\&#35;requesting_branches]
=== Requesting branches

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
\&#8230;.

This command will request a git branch for Fedora {MAJOROSVER}.

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-branch --all-releases
\&#8230;.

This command will request git branches for every currently active Fedora release.

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-branch --repo \&lt;source_package_name\&gt; f40
\&#8230;.

This form can be used to request branches when not inside package's Git repository.
You do not need to wait for your repository to be created before filing such branch request,
but you should request the repository before requesting branches.

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-branch epel{MAJOREPELVER}
\&#8230;.

This command will request a git branch for EPEL {MAJOREPELVER}.

[\&#35;epel-only_packages]
=== Retirement of \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch in EPEL-only packages

Some packages are only needed for EPEL.
For those packages, after the repo has been created, the \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch \&#42;must\&#42; be retired.
Use the following command (with the \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branched checked out):
\&#8230;.
fedpkg retire \&lt;epel_only_package\&gt;
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;merging_between_branches]
=== Merging between branches

You can maintain each branch entirely separately, if you like,
laboriously copying changes between them
(so long as you always stay within the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy] requirements).
However, git provides us with several handy tools for working with branches.
Here's an example:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone bzrtools
\&#35; Make some changes in the rawhide branch
fedpkg new-sources bzrtools-2.2.tar.gz
gedit bzrtools.spec
fedpkg commit
fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
git merge rawhide
\&#35; for push into repo
fedpkg push
\&#8230;.

This will _merge_ the changes from the \&#96;rawhide\&#96; branch to the \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96; branch.
Git aficionados may note this is a somewhat unusual workflow,
but it is appropriate to the context of package management.
Remember,
after pushing to and building for a stable release
or a xref:releases::branched.adoc[Branched] release
after xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc\&#35;updates-testing-activation[updates-testing activation],
you will have to xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc[submit an update]
before any other Fedora users will see your build.

Note that merges will only be sure to work cleanly
so long as the branches have not previously diverged.
That is, if you do this:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone bzrtools
\&#35; Make some changes in the rawhide branch
fedpkg commit
fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
\&#35; Make some changes in the f{MAJOROSVER} branch
fedpkg commit
fedpkg switch-branch rawhide
\&#35; Make some more changes in the rawhide branch
fedpkg commit
fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
git merge rawhide
\&#8230;.

you may encounter a _merge conflict_.

Remember that git is a _collaborative_ system,
and used as such in Fedora package management.
It is often the case that you must consider
changes made by others
in working on a package,
and consider how your changes will affect others.

[\&#35;resolving_merge_conflicts]
=== Resolving merge conflicts

This is a large topic and somewhat beyond the scope of this guide,
but we can give basic pointers.
There are other good references in the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging[Git book]
and at https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line[GitHub Docs].

When you merge and a conflict occurs,
you can edit the files that have conflicts.
Remove the conflict markers in the files
and merge the changes manually.
Use \&#96;git diff\&#96; or \&#96;fedpkg diff\&#96; to inspect the changes
against the pre-conflict state
and verify you are happy with the resolution.
Then you can commit the files with \&#96;fedpkg commit\&#96; or \&#96;git commit -a\&#96;.
Git will know if you have resolved the conflict
by checking that all the conflict markers have been removed.

[\&#35;using_git_mergetool_to_resolve_conflicts]
=== Using git mergetool to resolve conflicts

Git provides a graphical diff program to help resolve conflicts.
This can be handy for visualizing what changes have occurred
and dealing with them as a set.

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
git config --global merge.tool meld
fedpkg switch-branch f{MAJOROSVER}
git merge rawhide
\&#35; Conflicts occurred.
\&#35; Open a meld showing a three way diff of the merge, working tree, and the last commit.
git mergetool
\&#35; Resolved all the conflicts in the GUI
git add CONFLICTEDFILES
git commit
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;requesting_special_dist_tags]
== Multi-package updates

When a change to a package affects a large number of dependencies
(e.g. all perl, python, ruby or ghc packages),
requiring them to be rebuilt,
it may be better to initially do the builds in a _side tag_,
so that there is less disruption in Rawhide.
See xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc\&#35;multiple_packages[Package Update Guide, section Multi-package updates] for details.

[\&#35;using_fedpkg_anonymously]
== Using fedpkg anonymously

You can use fedpkg like this:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg clone --anonymous
\&#8230;.

to check out a package without requiring identification.
Obviously, you will not be able to push any changes to this repository,
but it is useful for non-packagers
who simply want to examine a package
and make changes for their own use.

If the intention is to submit changes to a Fedora developer,
see xref:Pull_Request_Guide.adoc\&#35;review[Pull Request Guide].

[\&#35;tips_and_tricks]
== Tips and tricks

[\&#35;local_branch_names]
=== Local branch names

If you use git commands to branch and checkout directly,
you can define whatever local branch names you want.
If you use \&#96;fedpkg switch-branch\&#96;,
it will default to creating the names used in the examples above.

[\&#35;current_branch_and_state_in_shell_prompt]
=== Current branch and state in shell prompt

It is often helpful to know what branch you are working on
at a glance.
You can add this information to your bash prompt
with the information https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Git_quick_reference?rd=Git_Quickref\&#35;Display_current_branch_in_bash[here].

[\&#35;importing_a_.src.rpm_to_update]
=== Importing a .src.rpm to update

The command usually used to initially populate a git package repository
from a .src.rpm that has been through the xref:Package_Review_Process.adoc[Package Review Process]
can also be used to update a normal working copy,
if you have an old-school packaging process
to which you are particularly attached.
Just run \&#96;fedpkg import file.src.rpm\&#96;
and it will upload new tarballs into lookaside cache,
update a working copy of the last version found in git,
and commit all changes.
\&#96;fedpkg import --help\&#96; documents some other parameters it can accept.

CAUTION: This approach makes it harder to verify that your changes are safe
and do not overwrite changes made to the package by others.
For this reason, its use is not recommended.

[\&#35;making_changes_on_an_older_branch_without_breaking_the_upgrade_path]
=== Making changes on an older branch without breaking the upgrade path

Here is the scenario:
You have built your package successfully on the \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96; branch,
but there is a problem keeping your package from building on \&#96;last\&#96;.

Solution:
Make your changes in the branch
and then add a digit to the very right of the release tag.
There is no need to change the release in the other branches.
This allows upgrades to work smoothly
if the user upgrades to a newer release of Fedora.

\&#8230;.
Name:    foo
Version: 1.0
Release: 1%{?dist}

Name:    foo
Version: 1.0
Release: 1%{?dist}.1
\&#8230;.

Then tag and build as usual.
This approach was initially discussed https://listman.redhat.com/archives/fedora-extras-list/2006-May/msg00083.html[in this mailing list thread].

[\&#35;removing_a_package_build_pending_for_rawhide_or_branched]
=== Removing a package build pending for Rawhide or Branched

From time to time
you may want to remove a package build you submitted to Rawhide or to Branched
prior to the Alpha freeze
(both cases where the build would usually go
out to the main xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc[repository]
without further gating).
This could happen in a situation
where a bug or issue is found in your package
that will be resolved upstream in the next release,
or you realize you made a significant mistake in the build
that cannot easily be corrected.

CAUTION: This should only be done on the same day of the build,
before it is included in a compose.
If your build was already included in a compose you must not untag it!
Check the https://pdc.fedoraproject.org//[Product Definition Center] to get the starting time of the last compose.

You can remove the package by using https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji[Koji]:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
koji untag-pkg f{NEXTOSVER} foo-1.1.3-1.fc{NEXTOSVER}
\&#8230;.

where \&#96;foo-1.1.3-1.fc{NEXTOSVER}\&#96; is replaced with the name of your package build.
See \&#96;koji help\&#96; or xref:Using_the_Koji_Build_System.adoc[Using the Koji Build System] for more information.

[\&#35;ssh_fingerprint]
=== ssh fingerprint

The recommended option is to include \&#96;VerifyHostKeyDNS yes\&#96;
in your \&#96;~/.ssh/config\&#96; file.
This will result in using DNS to check that the key is correct.

But you can also manually check
against the list of keys at https://apps.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Apps].
The strings there are what ends up in your \&#96;~/.ssh/known_hosts\&#96; file.
So you can accept the fingerprint when prompted
and then check that the correct string for src.fedoraproject.org
ended up in your \&#96;~/.ssh/known_hosts\&#96; file.

[\&#35;problems_connecting_to_the_repository]
=== Problems connecting to the repository

The \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; tool clones repositories using the ssh:// protocol,
so this should not be a problem normally
(as long as you have your ssh key).
If you cloned using the \&#96;git\&#96; utility itself,
check the \&#96;.git/config\&#96; file
to ensure the remote repository is being accessed via an ssh:// protocol,
and not git://.

[\&#35;problems_pushing_to_forked_repository]
=== Problems pushing to forked repository using http

Pushing to your forked repository using http might fail with an error like this:

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

This is caused by \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; failing to connect to MBS which has now been decomissioned. Removing the reference to MBS in \&#96;/etc/rpkg/fedpkg.conf\&#96; should fix this.

Change this line in \&#96;fedpkg.conf\&#96;:

oidc_scopes = openid,https://id.fedoraproject.org/scope/groups,https://src.fedoraproject.org/push
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

[\&#35;it_builds_here_why_doesnt_it_build_there]
=== It builds here, why doesn't it build there?

Is your package building locally
— even with Mock, even as a scratch build!
— but not when you run \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;?
Before you get too frustrated,
remember \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96; runs on the package as it exists in the upstream repository,
not your local working copy.
Make sure you have committed and pushed all changes and source files,
and handled the lookaside cache correctly.
Other issues that have been reported,
are issues because of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179139[build/make check parallelization]
and failures because of test suites that depend on operations finish on precise timing
(and a busy build system may not be able to perform operations on time).

= Package Update Guide

This document shows how to submit an update
for a package you maintain in Fedora.
It assumes you already have a package in the Fedora repositories.
It is not a guide to using the Fedora package source control system:
see xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package Maintenance Guide] for that.

\&#42; For details of the policy on requirements for updates
at various stages of the xref:releases::lifecycle.adoc[Fedora Release Life Cycle],
refer to the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy].

== Overview

This page is intended for new and existing package maintainers.
Testers and regular users may be interested in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing[updates-testing] repository
and the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Update_feedback_guidelines[Update feedback guidelines].
This page specifically covers the update submission process.

There are two significantly different package update submission workflows in Fedora:

\&#42; _Before updates-testing activation_,
which is used for xref:releases::rawhide.adoc[Rawhide] and xref:releases::branched.adoc[Branched]
up to the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc\&#35;updates-testing-activation[Updates-testing Activation].

\&#42; _After updates-testing activation_,
which is used for Branched releases after Updates-testing Activation, and stable releases.

The repository layouts differ somewhat for Rawhide, Branched and stable releases,
but the update workflows split up as described above.

There is also a difference between single-package updates
and multi-package updates.

[\&#35;finding_dependents]
== Finding dependents

It is important to include all the needed packages in the update.
Even if you initially just intend to update a single package,
ABI or API incompatibility may require updating also other packages.

First step in determining the possible impact is to list dependencies.
This can be done using the \&#96;fedrq\&#96; tool:

----
$ fedrq whatrequires-src --branch rawhide --format source --exclude-subpackages python-pydantic
fawltydeps
fedrq
input-remapper
matrix-synapse
psi4
⋮
----

Some or all of listed dependents may be affected and require action.
The simplest case is where there is no breakage and nothing needs to be done.
The second case is an ABI break that can be resolved by simply rebuilding the dependent
while using the new dependency version.
In more complicated cases,
the dependents may need to be updated to compatible versions
or (hopefully temporarily) patched to work with the new dependency version.

Only if there are no dependents (the original package to update is a 'leaf package'),
or none of the dependents require any action,
the single-package workflow can be used.
In all other cases, the full tree of affected dependencies needs to be updated together.
Note that the \&#96;fedrq\&#96; invocation above is not recursive.
In case a dependent needs to be modified,
the same impact check needs to be done for that package,
and any further affected packages included in the update.

[\&#35;rawhide_and_early_branched]
[\&#35;single_packages]
== Single-package updates before updates-testing activation

Most packages can be updated alone,
without needing to be grouped with other packages
for consistent dependencies.
These are 'single package builds'.
If the change you are making affects other packages,
see xref:multiple_packages[Multi-package updates].

The update workflow for single package builds
before updates-testing activation
is simple:

. Build the package with \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;. See xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package Maintenance Guide] for more details.

This is all you need to do,
a Bodhi update will be created automatically,
from which potential tests will be run,
some of which may gate the update.
In the Bodhi web UI, gating tests are indicated by an asterisk.

\&#42; If the built package doesn't have gating tests,
or if they succeed,
the update will be marked as _stable_
and your package will appear in subsequently created build roots,
as well as in the next daily compose of Rawhide or Branched
and will be used in any image composes built from that tree.

\&#42; If the built package has gating tests which fail,
this will be recorded in the update.
You can now fix whatever is wrong with the package and build it again,
which in turn will create a new update,
running the tests
(on the now hopefully fixed package),
and so forth.
If you're absolutely sure that the test shouldn't fail,
you can xref:waive_a_result[waive the failing tests],
but please check with the xref:ci::index.adoc\&#35;_contact[Fedora CI] and/or https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA\&#35;Communicate[Quality team]
before waiving a failure.


[\&#35;later_branched_and_stable_releases]
== Single-package updates after updates-testing activation

At the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/\&#35;updates-testing-activation[updates-testing activation] point,
the Bodhi update feedback system is enabled by https://docs.pagure.org/releng/[Release Engineering]
and builds submitted with \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;
are no longer automatically sent to any official https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/repositories/[repository].
The update workflow for releases of this type is:

. Build the package with \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;

. Submit an update for the package
with \&#96;fedpkg update\&#96;,
the https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/[Bodhi web interface],
or the \&#96;bodhi-cli\&#96; tool.
This causes the package to be sent
to the xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc\&#35;the-updates-testing-repository[updates-testing] repository.

. Monitor the update's status
and the feedback you receive
via the web interface or email,
and modify it with updated or additional builds if necessary.

. After the update meets the criteria in the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy]
and you are satisfied it should be released as a stable update,
submit the update to xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc\&#35;stable-is-not-a-repository[stable]
with \&#96;bodhi updates request \&lt;update_id\&gt; stable\&#96;
or the web interface.

Just like early Branched and Rawhide updates,
gating tests may be run on the update.
If any fail,
you should fix the problem,
send a new build,
and edit it into the update.

At the time you submit the update, you will be asked for several attributes.
See section xref:update_attributes[Update attributes] for guidance.

[\&#35;multiple_packages]
== [[updating_inter_dependent_packages]] Multi-package updates

Some updates require changes in multiple related packages.
For example, if you maintain \&#96;bar\&#96; which depends on \&#96;libfoo\&#96;,
and you need to update \&#96;libfoo\&#96;,
you should check that \&#96;bar\&#96; still works with the updated \&#96;libfoo\&#96;.
If it does not, you must ensure the appropriate changes are made to \&#96;bar\&#96;,
and include the updated \&#96;bar\&#96; in your update along with the updated \&#96;libfoo\&#96;.

=== Side tags

Fedora has the concept of using side tags for these situations,
which means the builds are done 'on the side'
and do not affect packages out of the side tag,
nor are they available for installing until the side tag is merged.
Updates are never automatically created for side tag builds.
Using a side tag is the best and recommended way to do multi-package updates.

Packagers can create side tags on their own,
allowing them to build disruptive components in isolation
and submit the builds in a side tag as one update in Bodhi,
to be tested and subsequently merged into the main distribution.

Side tags are cleaned up 30 days after creation,
or 14 days if they have not been used at all.
Make sure and use your side tag before then.

[\&#35;creating_a_side_tag]
==== Creating a side tag

The easiest way to create a side tag
is to be in the checked out  branch (e.g. \&#96;rawhide\&#96;) of one of the packages
and issue the following command:

----
fedpkg request-side-tag
----

Alternatively, the following variants allow specifying the Fedora release or the base tag for the side tag:

[subs='attributes+']
----
fedpkg --release f{NEXTOSVER} request-side-tag
fedpkg request-side-tag --base-tag f{NEXTOSVER}-build
----

\&#96;fedpkg\&#96; will tell you the commands to build a package in the specific side tag
and to wait for the respective build root to be recreated:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg request-side-tag
Side tag 'f{NEXTOSVER}-build-side-7863' (id 7863) created.
Use 'fedpkg build --target=f{NEXTOSVER}-build-side-7863' to use it.
Use 'koji wait-repo f{NEXTOSVER}-build-side-7863' to wait for the build repo to be generated.
----

The latter is important if any builds depend on previous ones in the side tag.
Use \&#96;koji wait-repo --request --build \&lt;package-nvr\&gt; \&lt;side-tag\&gt;\&#96; to ensure
that the respective build is available in the build root for subsequent builds.
Including \&#96;--request\&#96; is important since Koji switched to on-demand repo generation.
It asks Koji to re-generate the repo immediately if the build is not currently in it.

It is sometimes useful to test mockbuilds using a side tag.
You can do this using the following command, where \&#96;\&lt;sidetag\&gt;\&#96;
is your side tag:

[subs='attributes+']
----
$ fedpkg mockbuild -- --addrepo='https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/repos/\&lt;sidetag\&gt;/latest/$basearch/'
----

[\&#35;bodhi_update_for_builds_in_a_side_tag]
==== Bodhi update for builds in a side tag

When you're done building all packages you want in a side tag,
you have to submit them as an update to Bodhi
before they can be made available generally to be installed and built upon.
Even for Rawhide and early Branched,
when using a side tag,
you must create the update manually.

In the _Create New Update_ form in Bodhi,
choose the _Use Side-Tag_ drop-down
to create an update from the latest package builds in the respective tag:

image:Bodhi-builds-from-side-tag.png[Bodhi-builds-from-side-tag.png,title='Bodhi-builds-from-side-tag.png']

As with single packages, tests will be run
whose result affects if the update can be moved to stable.
The difference is that gating tests have to succeed (or be waived) for all builds in the update.
If you have to update the list of builds,
e.g. to fix problems found during testing,
send the new build to your side tag,
then edit the update and refresh the list of builds using the 🔃 (refresh) button:

image:Bodhi-builds-refresh-from-side-tag.png[Bodhi-builds-refresh-from-side-tag.png,title='Bodhi-builds-refresh-from-side-tag.png']

This will change the update to use the latest builds from the side tag.
If there are multiple builds for the same package in the side tag,
it will always use the most recently tagged one.

The web interface only works if you are the creator of the side tag.
If you are a proven packager submitting an update for a side tag,
you currently need to use the bodhi cli:

[subs='attributes+']
----
bodhi updates new --from-tag --notes 'whatever' f{NEXTOSVER}-build-side-7863
----

For more general information on creating updates,
see xref:update_attributes[Update attributes].
Once the update is created,
it will behave similarly to a single-package update.
For Rawhide and early Branched,
it will go to stable as soon as any gating tests pass.
For later Branched and stable releases,
it will require positive feedback or some time in updates-testing,
as explained in xref:later_branched_and_stable_releases[the earlier section].

Once the update moves to stable,
the builds will be tagged to the main tag of the release,
i.e. are available for the general public.
The side tag will be automatically removed.

[\&#35;adding_removing_builds_to_from_a_side_tag]
==== Adding/Removing builds to/from a side tag
As a packager, you can add or remove builds from your side tag using these commands:

----
koji tag \&lt;side-tag\&gt; \&lt;nvr\&gt;
koji untag \&lt;side-tag\&gt; \&lt;nvr\&gt;
----

This can be used to remove a build that made a test fail
or to add a build that was originally missed.
If you add or remove a build from a side tag,
you will have to refresh the corresponding update in Bodhi.

[WARNING]
=========
Removing the last build in a side-tag will automatically remove/delete the side tag.

=========

==== Using macros in a side tag

Koji allows macros to be set in a side tag.
This is useful in certain scenarios,
such as changing configuration of builds in this side tag
without changing their sources.
The following commands may be used to set and unset macro respectively:

----
$ koji edit-sidetag --rpm-macro \&lt;macro\&gt;=\&lt;value\&gt; \&lt;side-tag\&gt;
$ koji edit-sidetag --remove-rpm-macro \&lt;macro\&gt; \&lt;side-tag\&gt;
----

TIP: Please make sure \&#96;python3-koji-cli-plugins\&#96; is installed on your system
to have the \&#96;koji edit-sidetag\&#96; command available.

The following commands can be used to review macros configured for the side tag:

----
$ koji taginfo \&lt;side-tag\&gt;
$ koji list-history --tag \&lt;side-tag\&gt;
----

TIP: Please note that the macro changes won't take effect immediately.
It is necessary to wait using \&#96;$ koji wait-repo \&lt;side-tag\&gt;\&#96; command
until the repository data is refreshed.

While modifying the macro configuration on side-tags can be useful,
it can also be problematic.
As such,
macros must be approved by FESCo
and the list of currently supported macros is available in the
xref:fesco::Policy_for_buildroot_macros.adoc[Policy for Buildroot Macros].

[\&#35;removing_side_tag]
==== Removing a side tag
To conserve build system resources,
side tags that are not needed anymore should be removed.
This can be achieved with \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; as follows:

----
fedpkg remove-side-tag \&lt;side-tag\&gt;
----

Bodhi automatically removes side tags used for updates pushed to stable,
so removing them manually is usually not necessary.

=== Bodhi multi-package updates

You can also create an update with multiple packages directly in Bodhi,
either with the https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org[Bodhi web application],
or with the \&#96;bodhi\&#96; command line tool.
This is usually a worse method than using a side tag,
because managing the build root is more difficult
and will affect packages outside of the group.
It may be appropriate if the packages logically belong together as an update,
but do not have any build-time interdependencies.
You cannot use this method for Rawhide or early Branched updates,
because of the automatic update creation system.

You can pass multiple package names to \&#96;bodhi updates new\&#96; command
to create a new multi-package update,
or use \&#96;bodhi updates edit\&#96; to edit an existing update.

It is possible you will run into problems with permissions
when you are not the maintainer of the package you are trying to add to an update,
or when you are trying to add packages to an update created by somebody else.
If you encounter a situation like this,
you should contact the https://docs.pagure.org/releng/[release engineering] team
or a proven packager for help.

[\&#35;buildroot_overrides]
==== Buildroot overrides

When trying to do a multi-package update without using side tags,
you may need to use https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi/BuildRootOverrides[buildroot overrides].
A buildroot override puts a build that is not yet stable
into the main build root for the release.
Before on-demand side tags,
this was the usual way to create a multi-package update
when the packages have build-time interdependencies.
Unlike with side tags, buildroot overrides are not isolated
and thus should be only used in special cases where side tags do not suffice.

[\&#35;update_attributes]
== Update attributes

At the time you submit an update,
you will be asked for several attributes.
The type of the update should be fairly self-explanatory:
Either it fixes bugs,
adds new features,
or is a new package.

If you are asked whether you want to send the update
to _updates-testing_ or _stable_,
this is a no-op:
all updates now go through _updates-testing_. It does not matter what you choose.

There are several schools of thought
on filling out the update description.
Some would suggest you consider the target audience:
for a stable release, in particular, many Fedora users will see this text,
and many of them may not be particularly familiar with your package.
Consider not simply describing literally the changes in the update,
but explaining as if to an outsider
why your are updating the package,
what benefits it will bring to them (if any),
and anything they may want to note
in order to have a smooth update experience.

If you associate one or more bug reports with your update,
Bodhi will post comments into Bugzilla
to alert those following the bug reports
that an update is available.
If you mark your update as fixing the bug(s),
Bodhi will move the report(s) through
the \&#96;MODIFIED\&#96;, \&#96;ON_QA\&#96; and \&#96;CLOSED ERRATA\&#96; states
of the xref:bug_status.adoc[Bug Status Workflow]
as your update reaches various points in the process.
Using this mechanism can be very useful
both for you and for users of your package.

You may set thresholds for automatic push to stable
based on positive feedback (karma)
and/or time spent in updates-testing.
If your update's total karma
(items of positive feedback minus items of negative feedback)
reaches the karma threshold, it will be pushed stable automatically.
If your update reaches the threshold for time in updates-testing
without the builds changing
or the total karma going so low it is unpushed,
it will be pushed stable automatically.

There are defaults for these thresholds
which vary at different points in the release process.

If you choose to use the karma auto-push threshold,
please carefully consider an appropriate feedback level.
For a relatively obscure package which is quite stable,
1 or 2 may be an appropriate value.
For a popular, sensitive and complex package
such as \&#96;firefox\&#96; or \&#96;kernel\&#96;,
the default may be insufficient
and a choice of 5
or even 10
may be appropriate.

[\&#35;handling_feedback_from_automated_tests]
== Handling feedback from automated tests

Fedora's automated testing systems,
including Fedora CI, openQA, and Fedora CoreOS CI,
may run automated tests on your update.

In the Bodhi web interface, updates have an _Automated Tests_ tab
which displays the results of all automated tests.
Tests with an asterisk (star) at the left-hand side of the row are 'gating' tests.
These are the tests which prevent your update going stable if they fail.
If a test does not have an asterisk, it is not gating,
and does not affect whether your update can be pushed stable.
For updates in the critical path,
some gating tests are always present.
For updates not in the critical path,
there may be gating tests
if any package in the update has configured them in its package-level gating configuration.
If a failed gating test is waived,
the asterisk is replaced with a thumbs-up.

\&#42; Tests shown with a red background failed.
\&#42; Tests shown with a green background passed.
\&#42; Tests shown with a blue background and an 'i' icon had some minor issue, but effectively passed.
\&#42; Tests shown with a blue background and an hourglass icon are pending.

The tests are not all 100% accurate,
but they are fairly often correct.
Especially failures of openQA tests -
those whose name starts with _update._ -
should always be investigated and resolved
before an update is pushed stable.
If you see a failure, it is a very good idea to click on the result
(which will take you to a detailed log)
and investigate the issue.
If you are unsure what the test indicates,
you can contact the relevant team for help.
When a test has failed gating, a box is shown with contact details.

The Fedora Quality team proactively investigates failed openQA tests
and will usually resolve them or post a comment on the update
explaining the problem and suggesting a resolution.

[\&#35;waive_a_result]
=== Waive a result

Any failure of a gating test will prevent your update from being released.
On the update's _Details_ page in the Bodhi web interface,
the \&#42;Test Gating\&#42; status will be shown as
_N of N required tests failed_,
and one or more red rows with asterisks should be present on the _Automated Tests_ tab.
If you are absolutely sure such a failure is a false one,
you can 'waive' all failed gating tests from the Bodhi web interface
by clicking the \&#42;Waive Test Results\&#42; button.
This button is only present when an update has failed gating tests,
and you have privileges to control the update.
At present it is not possible to waive the absence of a result
for a gating test in this way.
If needed, this can be done with \&#96;waiverdb-cli\&#96;.
Please do not waive failures of openQA tests -
those whose names start with _update._ -
without checking with the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA\&#35;Communicate[Fedora Quality team].

A tool called \&#96;waiverdb-cli\&#96; exists for filing waivers manually,
though this should rarely be necessary.
The tool is also missing some features needed to correctly specify waivers in some cases,
like the ability to specify a scenario.
It is not currently packaged in Fedora.
You can get it from the https://pagure.io/waiverdb[the waiverdb repository],
which also has some instructions on usage.

[\&#35;who_will_receive_your_update_when]
== Who will receive your update, when?

Before updates-testing activation,
when an update goes _stable_ it is tagged for inclusion in the next compose.
Composes are usually run daily at 05:15 UTC and take several hours.
After a compose completes,
it takes some more time for it to reach the public mirrors.
All users will see your update when they update their systems
after a successful compose containing your update
has reached the mirrors.

For Branched releases after updates-testing activation,
the _updates-testing_ repository is enabled by default
so most users will get your update soon after it is pushed there,
but only packages that have been pushed to _stable_
are used in building composes
(both nightlies and the Beta and Final candidates and releases).
The _updates-testing_ repository is regenerated daily.

When a release is in stable state,
the _updates-testing_ repository is disabled by default,
but Quality team members and others run with it enabled
in order to provide testing and Bodhi feedback.
The main user population will see your update only when it passes Bodhi,
is marked as _stable_
and reaches the _updates_ repository.
Both _updates-testing_ and _updates_ repositories are regenerated daily.

Where a package goes when it is marked as _stable_
differs between Branched and stable releases.
In Branched releases,
_stable_ packages are pushed to the base _fedora_ repository.
In stable releases,
_stable_ packages are pushed to the _updates_ repository.
However, from the point of view of the packager,
this is an insignificant implementation detail.
For more details, see xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc[Repositories].

[\&#35;branched_milestone_freezes]
== Branched milestone freezes

For a short period before each milestone release,
the stable xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc\&#35;the-fedora-repository-in-branched-releases[fedora] repository is frozen.
These periods are shown as _Milestone freezes_
(Post-branch Freeze, Beta Freeze, Final Freeze)
on schedules.
During these periods, builds will not be marked _stable_
and pushed from _updates-testing_ to _fedora_
even after being submitted manually or automatically.
In the normal course of events,
they will be pushed after the milestone release is approved
at a https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Go_No_Go_Meeting[Go No Go Meeting].
If you believe your update deserves to break a milestone freeze,
a _freeze exception_ may be granted
through the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_freeze_exception_bug_process[freeze exception process].
Accepted release blocking bugs are granted the same status
through the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_blocker_bug_process[blocker bug process].

For more on the Fedora development process, see xref:releases::lifecycle.adoc[Fedora Release Life Cycle].

[\&#35;security_updates]
== Security updates

For bugs identified as security issues,
there is an additional process
that layers over the regular update process.
If a bug is assigned to you
that blocks a https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Tracking_Bugs[Security Tracking Bug],
you must follow that process in addition to this one.

[\&#35;new_package_submissions]
== New package submissions

If you want to build a new package,
but you aren't sure which releases to send it to:

\&#42; New packages should always be built for Rawhide

\&#42; New packages can be built for Branched and stable releases
if adding them would provide value to users of those releases
without significant risk of causing harm

The submission process for new packages,
after they have passed the xref:Package_Review_Process.adoc[Package Review Process]
and been given an SCM repository,
is exactly the same as that for package updates.

[\&#35;consider_creating_a_package_test_plan]
== Consider creating a package test plan

If you https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_test_case_creation[create test cases] for your package,
and https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_package_test_plan_creation[categorize them appropriately],
they will be automatically linked in Bodhi,
so that testers will have some guidance
for planned update testing.




= Pull Request Guide

Fedora dist-git repositories allow pull requests,
which makes it possible for anybody to
contribute to any package without having maintainer status.
Package maintainers may also choose to use pull requests
to allow co-maintainers to review the proposed changes,
and hook into dist-git \&lt;\&lt;Continuous integration\&gt;\&gt;.

The same packaging tools and workflows that maintainers use
can be used for pull request contributions,
with the exception of certain privileged operations
that can only be performed package maintainers,
such as submitting a Bodhi update.

This guide describes one possible workflow for submitting a pull request.
See xref:Package_Maintenance_Guide.adoc[Package Maintenance Guide]
for more comprehensive tooling guide.
That guide contains many options that can be used to create other workflows.

This guide assumes that you are creating a pull request to a package named \&#96;some-package\&#96;.
The target branch for the pull request is assumed to be _rawhide_,
as Rawhide is much more common change target than release branches.
Any other release, such as \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96;, would mostly differ in branch name.

This guide also assumes you are not a member of the _packager_ group,
with separate notes in places where packagers should do something differently.

== When to make a pull request?

In general, the reasons for making pull requests to Fedora packages are similar to
reasons for making pull requests to any open source repository.
Either you are a user of the package and want to improve it for you own use,
or you are contributing to another project or package
and need to change something to unblock your own work.
Or you find something that can be improved while inspecting the package repo,
and submit a pull request just to help the maintainers.

A Fedora-specific reason is the xref:How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group.adoc[packager sponsoring process],
which requires a packager candidate to demonstrate their packaging skills,
which can very conveniently be done via submitting pull requests.

A very common, and often simple, case is
that Fedora's version of a package is not the latest upstream release.
Package may also miss optional dependencies or use sub-optimal build options,
so that all features offered by upstream do not work on Fedora.

== Prerequisites

You need a https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[Fedora account].
In xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools],
you also need to follow sections
xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc\&#35;installing[Installing]
and xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc\&#35;mock[Configuration / Mock].

== Cloning the repository

Usually, package maintainers work directly in package's dist-git repository,
to which only they have access to.
For pull requests, using a fork is necessary.
While it is possible to create a fork using src.fedoraproject.org web interface
and clone it using plain Git commands,
\&#96;fedpkg fork\&#96; provides a convenient and simple CLI-based method.

----
fedpkg clone --anonymous some-package
cd some-package
fedpkg fork
----

In case \&#96;fedpkg fork\&#96; complains about missing Pagure token,
follow the instructions given in the error message.

These commands result in a local Git repository with remotes:
_origin_ for package's official dist-git repository in fetch-only mode,
and another one with you Fedora username pointing your fork that can also be pushed to:

----
$ git remote --verbose
origin    https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/some-package.git (push)
username  ssh://username@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/username/rpms/some-package.git (fetch)
username  ssh://username@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/username/rpms/some-package.git (push)
----

== Branching

Just as you would for any other pull request for any other project,
create a Git branch for your changes:

----
git switch -c my-changes
----

== Make changes

For pull requests, making local changes and testing the changes locally
is just the same for maintainers.
For example:

----
\&#35; change the required things in the specfile.
gedit some-package.spec
\&#35; download the referenced sources to local machine
spectool -g some-package.spec
\&#35; check that the changes you made still build
fedpkg --release rawhide mockbuild
\&#35; Install and test the package
----

== Updating sources

Only members of the _packager_ group can update sources to lookaside cache.
If downloaded source needs to be changed,
the best a non-packager can do is to update the \&#96;sources\&#96; file with the correct checksum:

----
fedpkg new-sources --offline some-package-1.2.3.tar.gz
----

If you are in the _packager_ group, you can remove \&#96;--offline\&#96; from the command,
so that the source archive is uploaded.
Otherwise, the maintainer who eventually merges the pull request has to do that.
In that case, make sure that the merge request uniquely points to the source archive.
Usually, that is done by using a URL in specfile's _Source_ tag,
but if not, a specfile comment can be used.

== Committing and pushing

Create a commit from your changes,
write a sensible commit message,
and push your branch to your fork:

----
git add \&lt;changed files\&gt;
git commit
git push username HEAD
----

Note that if the package uses https://fedora-infra.github.io/rpmautospec-docs/[rpmautospec],
the commit message will be parsed to create the package changelog entry.

== Creating pull request

When you push your changes to your fork,
you get a link for creating a pull request as output:

----
remote: Create a pull-request for my-changes
remote:    https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/username/rpms/some-package/diff/rawhide..my-changes
----

You can also create pull request for any branch in the Pagure web UI for your fork.

The pull request form asks you to fill description,
which is auto-filled with commit changelog.
Write any pertinent information there and submit.

If you could not populate the lookaside cache in \&lt;\&lt;Updating sources\&gt;\&gt; step,
include that info and ask for a maintainer to do that.

[\&#35;ci]
== Continuous integration

Dist-git repositories are connected to CI by default.
For all pull requests, a Koji scratch build and installability test is done.
Results for these appear in the pull request's web page when they are available.
Even though failing CI does not block merging, the CI results should be green.
If CI fails, it is a good idea to fix that.

If you need to re-run the test build in pull requests,
a comment with \&#96;[citest]\&#96; will do so.

Package maintainers may also enable more advanced
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zuul-based-ci\&#35;How_to_attach_a_Pagure_repository_on_Zuul[Zuul] CI.

== Review

Pull request review is just like for any other open source project.
Hopefully, a maintainer quickly responds to your pull request
and either simply merges it, asks questions or requests changes.
Answer questions, do the requested changes and push them to the same branch.

Note that many Fedora packages are maintained by volunteers,
and there are no hard limits for the expected response time for pull requests.
Because of this, the review may only come after days or weeks.
In case you feel that response takes too long,
you can (and should) follow the steps in
xref:fesco::Policy_for_nonresponsive_package_maintainers.adoc[Non-responsive maintainer policy].

== After the merge

The pull request is complete when a maintainer has merged it.
Afterwards, the maintainer still needs to:

\&#42; Update the lookaside cache, if you could not do it.

\&#42; Submit a build with \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;
(since any packager can do this for any commit in a release branch for any package,
if you are a packager, you can theoretically also do this.
But in practice it will be the maintainer who merges your pull request,
because they can start the build immediately after they merge.)

\&#42; In case changes were done to branch other than _rawhide_,
xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc[submit a Bodhi update].



= Reporting Issues

When working with Fedora Packaging, you may run across issues
in packages,
with the buildsystem,
with policies or process,
or with any number of other things.
Here are some basic guidelines to assist you
in reporting such issues to the right people.

[\&#35;where]
== Where to Report Issues

Any issue that requires direct work on Fedora's infrastructure
should be reported using the
https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues[Fedora Infrastructure issue tracker].
This would include frozen or failing build systems.

For issues within packages, see
xref:quick-docs::howto-file-a-bug.adoc[How to File a Bug].
This would include typical build errors.

Any questions about policy or processes should be reported to the
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] mailing list.
This would include questions of spec design, naming conventions or review concerns.

= Staying Close to Upstream Projects

The Fedora Project focuses,
as much as possible,
on not deviating from upstream in the software it includes in the repository.
The following guidelines are a general set of best practices,
and provide reasons why this is a good idea,
tips for sending your patches upstream,
and potential exceptions Fedora might make.
The primary goal is to share the benefits of a common codebase for end users and developers
while simultaneously reducing unnecessary maintenance efforts.

upstream (noun)::
In free and open source projects,
the _upstream_ of a program or set of programs
is the project that develops those programs.
Fedora is _downstream_ of those projects.
This term comes from the idea that water and the goods it carries float downstream
and benefit those who are there to receive it.

to upstream (verb)::
A short-hand way of saying 'push changes to the upstream project'.

[\&#35;what_are_deviations_from_upstream]
== What are deviations from upstream?

\&#42; \&#42;Patches\&#42;: Patches are the most common and obvious type of change from upstream.
Patches might be written by the package maintainer,
cherry picked or backported from upstream
or picked from other distributions.

\&#42; \&#42;Running sed or equivalent on a spec file\&#42;:
While this change is less obvious,
it should be considered functionally equivalent to a patch
for the purposes of this guide.
Also a patch is preferable
because running sed can sometimes change the software in unintended ways
especially when the package maintainer is pushing a new upstream release as an update
and such changes might not be obvious compared to a failed patch.

\&#42; Desktop files, systemd unit files, etc. are sometimes added as \&#42;additional sources\&#42;:
If you do this as a package maintainer,
you need to notify upstream and ideally get them included as part of the upstream source.
Maintaining them separately often involves additional maintenance.

\&#42; \&#42;Configuration options\&#42;:
For instance, if a particular upstream software allows both MySQL and Postgres as a database backend,
other distributions might have picked Postgres
and Fedora package might be configured to use the MySQL backend by default instead.
If upstream or other distributions are favoring one of the options over the others,
talk to them,
find out why
and rely on well tested and consistent options as much as possible.

\&#42; \&#42;Underlying libraries and other software components\&#42;:
Even without intentional modifications,
software in Fedora can still be different from upstream or other distributions,
due to precise library versions or other software components your package depends on.
For instance, Firefox may expose a sqlite bug,
and Fedora might be the only distribution building that precise version of Firefox
against that specific version of sqlite.
You should talk to upstream and find out whether there are any such known issues,
and search through upstream bug trackers
or other popular distribution bug trackers
to figure out such problems.

\&#42; \&#42;Miscellaneous\&#42;:
The above list is not comprehensive.
Even seemingly minor changes like the specific desktop theme or fonts
can exhibit bugs in other software,
or can expose a bug in the theme or font
but only with some specific software.
For instance, LibreOffice might have a problem displaying a list
when using the Adwaita theme and Dejavu font.
When analyzing issues,
make sure you consider the impact of every change
either in Fedora or by users themselves.

[\&#35;why_push_changes_upstream]
== Why push changes upstream?

\&#42; \&#42;Common Benefit And Reduced Maintenance Burden\&#42;:
When Fedora carries patches that are specific to Fedora or deviations from upstream projects,
those patches are not shared by every distribution.
This puts the burden of maintaining those patches on Fedora,
which includes keeping those patches in a functional state
by rewriting or forward-porting them for every upstream release.
This effort can quickly add up to be overwhelming,
while not being in the spirit of sharing the benefits
(as well as the effort in maintaining)
free and open source software.

\&#42; \&#42;Documentation\&#42;:
Upstream projects are documented formally
(in the form of man/info pages and longer guides)
and informally in many user forums or mailing lists as answers to user questions.
Deviations from upstream projects can thus confuse end users and upstream developers
when those patches cause changes in behavior that are Fedora specific
and not documented properly,
even where the formal documentation
(such as man pages)
are also patched to describe the changes.

\&#42; \&#42;Translations\&#42;:
Maintaining translations upstream gains the advantage of established translation communities,
which are most likely more experienced with the project terms.
Downstream projects benefit when using those translations.
In addition, it lifts the burden of hosting,
and of the need to merge often from upstream to downstream and back again.
To make sure translation work continues upstream.
Any string changes that were introduced by patches should be maintained by the downstream community.

\&#42; \&#42;Upstream Acceptance\&#42;:
Fedora is downstream of many thousands of software projects.
Much of this software is packaged by maintainers who are not programmers
or lack expertise in the language(s) the software is written in.
In some cases the software has a large and complex codebase
(such as the kernel or Libreoffice)
and the package maintainers might not have the same level of understanding in all areas
compared to subsystem maintainers or upstream developers.
For this and other reasons,
Fedora needs the acceptance of upstream software developers.
These developers may view any significant patches as a fork
or refuse to take bug reports from Fedora users
due to the differences in the codebase.
Fedora as a project strives to be welcoming and cooperative with upstream developers
as much as possible.
We must avoid Fedora specific patches
and any patches that are useful should be sent upstream to these developers
via mailing lists, bug trackers, or direct email.

\&#42; \&#42;Quality Assurance\&#42;: Patches that are accepted upstream
are usually reviewed or tested by many people
including developers and testers.
This includes testing by other GNU/Linux distributions.
A deviation from the common codebase used by many
is a potential chance of introducing a regression that is specific to Fedora.

\&#42; \&#42;Security\&#42;:
A special case of the 'Quality Assurance' issue
is that changes that have surprising security implications
are more likely to be detected by upstream
(who often have deeper knowledge of the program).

\&#42; \&#42;Fast incremental improvements\&#42;:
Staying close to upstream versions is helpful
when doing version bumps for updates that bring in new features.
This prevents tedious backporting of only security and bug fixes.
Deviations from upstream can significantly hamper the speed of delivering improvements
from new versions to end users.
However, regressions are to be avoided,
and potential improvements and new features must be carefully assessed
against the risk of harming the users experience.
Refer to xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy] for more details.

\&#42; \&#42;ABI or API Deviations\&#42;:
Patches that introduce a new application binary interface (ABI)
or application program interface (API)
must be especially avoided,
even if the ABI/API changes are planned to land upstream.
When these patches get upstream
(if ever),
upstream developers might introduce changes in the ABI/API
during the code review process before merging the code.
This could break other software in the repository
that makes use of the Fedora-patched ABI/API.

\&#42; \&#42;Direct End User Feedback\&#42;:
When users run into problems with any software that is in Fedora,
they can report the problems directly upstream.
By not deviating from upstream,
it remains a central location for all bug reports on that software,
leaving Fedora package maintainers to concentrate on good packaging
instead of acting in between users and upstream issues.

[\&#35;tips_on_upstreaming_patches]
== Tips On Upstreaming Patches

\&#42; Talk to upstream.
Maintaining a regular flow of communication with the upstream project
is helpful in understanding the upstream developers well,
and encourages them to be more responsive to your requests.
It also helps in understanding technical issues,
such as how they prefer patches to be submitted.

\&#42; Make the patches generic enough to be maintained by upstream developers.
Explain the need for your patches,
that is, what bugs they fix or what features they add.
Any references to bugzilla reports or user requests
can be quite useful for the developers who receive your patches.

\&#42; Do not consider any change to be too small to be sent upstream.
Even minor changes like fixing a permission problem in a file
or excluding an empty file
can and should be reported upstream
even if upstream does not necessarily act on all of them quickly.

\&#42; Divide patches into small and independent chunks that remain functional,
so they can be understood, reviewed, and accepted or rejected individually.

\&#42; If the patch introduces new strings or changes existing ones,
make the changes as generic as possible.

\&#42; Fix your coding style to match the upstream project's guidelines.
This might seem trivial
but many upstream projects insist on following their guidelines
so that their codebase looks internally self consistent
and is more maintainable.

\&#42; Where possible, encourage upstream point-releases that fix bugs and security issues only,
to avoid the possibility of regressions.

\&#42; Test your changes as thoroughly as you can before you send them upstream.
Broken patches leave a long-lasting bad impression.

\&#42; Be patient and cooperative.
If feedback is offered,
discuss changes, answer questions, and provide revisions that fix any problems.
Don't flame or argue unnecessarily with upstream developers.
The overall goal is persuade upstream developers to get your patches committed upstream
and not to demonstrate 'who is better.'
Don't forget the human element in these conversations.
If necessary,
we will have to carry some patches downstream to enforce our policies
even if upstream does not agree with us at that point.

[\&#35;some_examples_of_exceptions]
== Some Examples Of Exceptions

\&#42; \&#42;Severe Security Issues Or Major Bug Fixes\&#42;:
For any major issues such as security holes or data loss problems,
waiting on a new release from upstream can be too much of a delay.
In these instances, it may be better to backport those fixes from upstream
or fix the issue by writing your own patch
and do an update in Fedora.
If you are writing a new patch,
send it upstream so that Fedora shares the benefits
and avoid deviations in new releases that follow.
Be careful when expeding the patching however.
A security patch that is not comprehensive
can leave unexpected security holes still open
or a patch to fix a major problem can worsen the problem.
Get your patches peer reviewed as much as possible.
Due to differences in release schedules between upstream projects and Fedora releases,
maintainers would have to keep in mind feature and development freezes in Fedora
and fix problems accordingly.

\&#42; \&#42;Non-free or patent encumbered software\&#42;:
If upstream projects include software that is non-free or has known patent issues,
such software does not meet the xref:packaging-guidelines::LicensingGuidelines.adoc[Licensing Guidelines]
and Fedora will not include them.
In many instances, such code is optional in the form of plugins
that Fedora simply does not need to include
in its software repository.
In other cases,
it might be possible to work with upstream on making it optional
or patch specific portions.

\&#42; \&#42;Unmaintained Or Unresponsive Upstream Projects\&#42;:
In cases where upstream projects are either unmaintained or unresponsive,
it might be acceptable to patch the software.
If upstream is unmaintained,
you might want to consider sharing patches with other distributions
or taking over maintenance
if you have the time, skills, and interest.
Be wary of maintaining software with no upstream
since all the burden of maintaining the codebase
as well as packaging issues are with you.
If upstream is unresponsive and many distributions are deviating significantly,
it might be a opportunity for a cross distribution fork
(Similar to XFree86 and Xorg).

\&#42; \&#42;Patches Heading Upstream\&#42;:
Any patches that are known to be headed upstream
_might_ be patched temporarily in Fedora
if the patches provide important bug fixes
or in rare cases, features to users.
If this is done,
maintenance effort of the patches should be low impact
for the small amount of time until upstream merges the patches
and does a new release.

\&#42; \&#42;Distribution Integration\&#42;:
There are features that are critical or very good to have for Fedora as a distribution
but not been significant enough
for various upstream projects to accept related enhancements just yet.
Use your discretion carefully when choosing to integrate any such patches
since there is a trade off
between upstream acceptance and Fedora integration
and associated costs/benefits.

\&#42; \&#42;Bundling of Libraries\&#42;:
Refer to the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;bundling[Bundling and Duplication of System Libraries] section of the Packaging Guidelines for details.
Fixes related to bundling should of course be sent upstream if possible.

= Using the Koji build system

[\&#35;using_koji_in_fedora]
== Using Koji in Fedora

The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji[Koji Build System] is Fedora's RPM buildsystem.
Packagers use the \&#96;koji\&#96; client to request package builds
and get information about the buildsystem.
Koji runs on top of Mock to build RPM packages for specific architectures
and ensure that they build correctly.

You can use the \&#96;koji\&#96; command directly, or use \&#96;fedpkg\&#96;,
a script that interacts with the RPM Packaging system and other subsystems,
like \&#96;git\&#96; and \&#96;koji\&#96; itself.

[\&#35;installing_koji]
=== Installing Koji

Follow xref:Installing_Packager_Tools.adoc[Installing Packager Tools].

[\&#35;koji_config]
=== Koji Config

The global-local client configuration file for koji is \&#96;/etc/koji.conf\&#96;.
You should not need to change this from the defaults
for building Fedora packages.
These allow you to use the primary build system
as well as secondary arch build systems.

[\&#35;building_with_fedpkg_targets]
=== Building with fedpkg targets

When building with \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; within a git repository,
every push is automatically tagged via git.
All you have to do to build the package is to run \&#96;fedpkg build\&#96;.
This triggers a build request for the branch.
Easy!

It is also possible to target a specific koji tag:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg build --target \&lt;target\&gt;
\&#8230;.

For example,
if building on rawhide
against a side-tag for updating API for many packages,
such as \&#96;f{NEXTOSVER}-python\&#96;,
use the following:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
fedpkg build --target 'f{NEXTOSVER}-python'
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;chained_builds]
==== Chained builds
Sometimes you want to make sure
that one build has succeeded before launching the next one,
for example when you want to rebuild a package
against a dependency that has just been rebuilt.
\&#96;fedpkg\&#96; provides a \&#96;chain-build\&#96; command to help with this.
As explained in xref:Package_Update_Guide.adoc\&#35;multiple_packages[the Package Update Guide],
multi-build chains like this should be created on a side tag,
and you can use \&#96;fedpkg chain-build\&#96; to do the builds on the side tag.

To do a chained build to a side tag, first create the side tag,
as explained in the Package Update Guide. In the simplest case,
just do:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg request-side-tag
\&#8230;.

This will print a command you can use to wait for the side tag to be created.
Run that command, and when it exits, do:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg chain-build --target=\&lt;side_tag_name\&gt; libwidget libgizmo
\&#8230;.

replacing \&#96;\&lt;side_tag_name\&gt;\&#96; with the actual name of your side tag.

The current package is added to the end of the CHAIN list.
Colons (\&#96;:\&#96;) can be used in the CHAIN parameter to define groups of packages.
Packages in any single group will be built in parallel
and all packages in a group must build successfully
and populate the repository
before the next group will begin building.
For example:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg chain-build --target=\&lt;side_tag_name\&gt; libwidget libaselib : libgizmo :
\&#8230;.

causes \&#96;libwidget\&#96; and \&#96;libaselib\&#96; to be built in parallel,
followed by \&#96;libgizmo\&#96;,
and then the package in your current directory.
If no groups are defined,
packages will be built sequentially.

If a build fails,
following builds are canceled,
but the builds that already succeeded are pushed to the repository.

\&#42;Note:\&#42; It is possible to do a chained build
directly to the default build target for Rawhide,
but this is no longer recommended or reliable.
Building for the default Rawhide target immediately auto-creates an update,
and some Rawhide updates are now subject to gating tests.
If any package in the chain is subject to gating tests, and one fails,
that package will never reach _stable_
and the rest of the chain will not be able to build.
This is quite likely to happen to chains containing critical path packages.
When using a side tag, no updates will be automatically created,
and each build is immediately available in the side tag's buildroot
without having to pass tests first.
You can manually create the update once all the builds are done,
and the tests will not encounter dependency issues
if you rebuilt all the dependent packages correctly.

[\&#35;scratch_builds]
=== Scratch Builds

Sometimes it is useful to be able to build a package against the buildroot
without actually including it in the release.
This is called a scratch build.

The following section covers using koji directly,
as well as the fedpkg tool,
to do scratch builds.

To create a scratch build from changes you haven't committed, do the following:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg scratch-build --srpm
\&#8230;.

From the latest git commit:

\&#8230;.
koji build --scratch rawhide \&lt;git_url\&gt;
\&#8230;.

If you have committed the changes to git
and you are in the current branch,
you can do a scratch build with \&#96;fedpkg\&#96;,
which wraps the koji command line tool with the appropriate options:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg scratch-build
\&#8230;.

To run a scratch build for a specific architecture:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg scratch-build --arches \&lt;archs\&gt;
\&#8230;.

\&#96;\&lt;archs\&gt;\&#96; can be a comma separated list of several architectures.

Finally, it is possible to combine the scratch-build command
with a specific koji tag in the form:

\&#8230;.
fedpkg scratch-build --target \&lt;target\&gt;
\&#8230;.

Run \&#96;fedpkg scratch-build --help\&#96; or \&#96;koji build --help\&#96; for more information.

[\&#35;build_failures]
=== Build Failures

If your package fails to build, you get an error, for example:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
420066 buildArch kernel-2.6.18-1.2739.10.9.el{MAJOREPELVER}.jjf.215394.2.src.rpm,
ia64): open (build-1.example.com) -\&gt; FAILED: BuildrootError:
error building package (arch ia64), mock exited with status 10
\&#8230;.

Investigate why the build failed by looking at the log files.
If there is a \&#96;build.log\&#96;, start there.
Otherwise, look at \&#96;init.log\&#96;.

Each job you successfully start gets a unique task ID,
which is listed in its output.

Logs can be found in the web interface,
in the _Task_ pages for the failed task.
Alternatively, use \&#96;koji watch-log\&#96;, along with the task ID,
to view the logs.
See the help output for more details.

[\&#35;advanced_use_of_koji]
=== Advanced use of Koji

We've tried to make Koji self-documenting wherever possible.
The command line tool prints a list of valid commands,
and each command supports \&#96;--help\&#96;. For example:

\&#8230;.
$ koji help

Koji commands are:
build                Build a package from source
cancel-task          Cancel a task
help                 List available commands
latest-build         Print the latest rpms for a tag
latest-pkg           Print the latest builds for a tag
[\&#8230;]
\&#8230;.

\&#8230;.
$ koji build --help

usage: koji build [options]  tag URL
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--skip-tag            Do not attempt to tag package
--scratch             Perform a scratch build
--nowait              Don't wait on the build
[\&#8230;]
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;using_koji_to_generate_a_mock_config_to_replicate_a_buildroot]
==== Using koji to generate a mock config to replicate a buildroot

koji can be used to replicate a build root for local debugging.

\&#8230;.
koji mock-config --help
Usage: koji mock-config [options] name
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

Options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--arch=ARCH           Specify the arch
--tag=TAG             Create a mock config for a tag
--task=TASK           Duplicate the mock config of a previous task
--buildroot=BUILDROOT
Duplicate the mock config for the specified buildroot
id
--mockdir=DIR         Specify mockdir
--topdir=DIR          Specify topdir
--topurl=URL          url under which Koji files are accessible
--distribution=DISTRIBUTION
Change the distribution macro
-o FILE               Output to a file
\&#8230;.

For example to get the latest buildroot for \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}-build\&#96; run:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
koji mock-config --tag f{MAJOROSVER}-build --arch=x86_64 --topurl=https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/ f{MAJOROSVER}
\&#8230;.

You must pass \&#96;--topurl=https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/\&#96; to any mock-config command
to get a working mock-config from Fedora's koji.

[\&#35;using_koji_to_control_tasks]
==== Using Koji to control tasks

List tasks:

\&#8230;.
koji list-tasks
\&#8230;.

List only tasks requested by you:

\&#8230;.
koji list-tasks --mine
\&#8230;.

requeue an already-processed task (general syntax is: \&#96;koji resubmit [options] \&lt;task_id\&gt;\&#96;):

\&#8230;.
koji resubmit 3
\&#8230;.

[\&#35;building_a_package_with_the_command_line_tool]
==== Building a Package with the command-line tool

Instead of using the \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; target,
you can also directly use the command line tool, \&#96;koji\&#96;.

To build a package, the syntax is:

\&#8230;.
koji build \&lt;build_target\&gt; \&lt;git_url\&gt;
\&#8230;.

For example:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
koji build f{MAJOROSVER}-candidate 'git url'
\&#8230;.

The koji build command creates a build task in Koji.
By default, the tool will wait and print status updates until the build completes.
You can override this with the \&#96;--nowait\&#96; option.

NOTE: For fedora koji,
the git url MUST be based on pkgs.fedoraproject.org.
Other arbitrary git repos cannot be used for builds.

[\&#35;koji_tags_and_packages_organization]
=== Koji tags and packages organization

==== Terminology

In Koji, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish
between a package in general,
a specific build of a package,
and the various rpm files created by a build.
When precision is needed, these terms should be interpreted as follows:

\&#42; \&#42;Package\&#42;: The name of a source rpm.
This refers to the package in general
and not any particular build or subpackage.
For example: kernel, glibc, etc.

\&#42; Build: A particular build of a package.
This refers to the entire build:
all arches and subpackages.
For example: kernel-2.6.9-34.EL, glibc-2.3.4-2.19.

\&#42; RPM: A particular rpm.
A specific arch and subpackage of a build.
For example: kernel-2.6.9-34.EL.x86_64, kernel-devel-2.6.9-34.EL.s390, glibc-2.3.4-2.19.i686, glibc-common-2.3.4-2.19.ia64

[\&#35;tags_and_targets]
==== Tags and targets

Koji organizes packages using tags.
In Koji a tag is roughly a collection of packages:

\&#42; Tags support inheritance
\&#42; Each tag has its own list of valid packages (inheritable)
\&#42; Package ownership can be set per-tag (inheritable)
\&#42; When you build you specify a target rather than a tag

A build target specifies where a package should be built
and how it should be tagged afterward.
This allows target names to remain fixed
as tags change through releases.

[\&#35;koji_commands_for_tags]
==== Koji commands for tags

===== Targets

You can get a full list of build targets with the following command:

\&#8230;.
$ koji list-targets
\&#8230;.

You can see just a single target with the \&#96;--name\&#96; option:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
$ koji list-targets --name f{MAJOROSVER}
Name                           Buildroot                      Destination
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f{MAJOROSVER}                            f{MAJOROSVER}-build                      f{MAJOROSVER}-updates-candidate
\&#8230;.

This tells you a build for target \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}\&#96;
will use a buildroot with packages from the \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}-build\&#96; tag
and tag the resulting packages as \&#96;f{MAJOROSVER}-updates-candidate\&#96;.

You probably do not want to build against rawhide.
If Fedora N is the latest one out,
to build to the next one, choose \&#96;f\{N+1}\&#96;.

===== Tags

You can get a list of tags with the following command:

\&#8230;.
$ koji list-tags
\&#8230;.

===== Packages

As mentioned above,
each tag has its own list of packages that may be placed in the tag.
To see that list for a tag, use the \&#96;list-pkgs\&#96; command:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
$ koji list-pkgs --tag f{MAJOROSVER}
\&#8230;.

The first column is the name of the package,
the second tells you which tag the package entry has been inherited from,
and the third tells you the owner of the package.

[\&#35;latest_builds]
===== Latest Builds

To see the latest builds for a tag, use the \&#96;latest-pkg\&#96; command:

[subs='attributes+']
\&#8230;.
$ koji latest-pkg --all f{MAJOROSVER}
\&#8230;.

The output gives you not only the latest builds,
but which tag they have been inherited from
and who built them.

== Details

One of the core foundation of Fedora is _First_
which implies having the latest versions of software
(in rawhide and sometimes in released branches),
but as a package maintainer
it can be tedious to keep up with the releases from multiple projects.

Fedora thus offers a service to help with this.
This service is divided into three components:

\&#42; Anitya
\&#42; monitoring settings at Fedora Package Sources
\&#42; https://github.com/fedora-infra/the-new-hotness/[The-new-hotness]

=== Anitya

Available at https://release-monitoring.org[release-monitoring.org],
Anitya provides a web service where anyone can register a project.
Anitya will then broadcast a https://fedmsg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[fedmsg] message
when it finds a new release.
Checks are run by cron twice a day.

Anitya is not specific to Fedora
but we are using it as a way to learn about new releases.
Edit entries there to your heart's content.

Bugs, features request and patches should go to https://github.com/fedora-infra/anitya/issues[anitya/issues].

[\&#35;monitoring_settings_at_src.fedoraproject.org]
=== Monitoring settings at src.fedoraproject.org

Fedora package maintainers can use the bottom left column
at the package's page at https://src.fedoraproject.org/[src.fedoraproject.org]
to have it monitored by the-new-hotness (see below).

[\&#35;the_new_hotness]
=== The-New-Hotness

https://github.com/fedora-infra/the-new-hotness/[The-new-hotness] is an application that listens to the fedmsg bus
and acts upon receiving messages from https://release-monitoring.org[release-monitoring.org].

When it receives a message indicating that a project has a new release,
and that project is mapped to a Fedora package,
it will check in pkgdb2 if the Fedora package is marked to be monitored.

If the package is marked to be monitored,
the-new-hotness will open a ticket on https://bugzilla.redhat.com[Bugzilla]
mentioning the availability of the new release.
It will then clone the git repository,
bump the version and reset the release,
download the new sources (if it can)
and attempt a scratch build in koji.

The result of the scratch build is then added to the open bugzilla ticket.

Subsequent successful koji builds are added to the ticket as well.

NOTE: In some cases the scratch build will always fail
(for example if the \&#96;Source0\&#96; in the spec file cannot be adjusted automatically),
if you wish to avoid receiving the notification that the scratch-build failed,
you can set the monitoring flag in pkgdb2 to _nobuild_ (or _Bugs only_).
Then the bugzilla ticket will be created upon finding a new version,
but no scratch build will be made.

= Utilities for package maintainers

A number of utilities are available to support package maintainers in maintaining their packages.
This page attempts to list them, but is not a complete list.

== Testing new builds with pull requests and CI

See xref:Pull_Request_Guide.adoc\&#35;ci[Pull Request Guide].

== Running fedora-review on review tickets using fedora-review service

The link:https://github.com/FrostyX/fedora-review-service/[Fedora Review Service] automatically runs \&#96;fedora-review\&#96; on new package review tickets.
One can add a comment with \&#96;[fedora-review-service-build]\&#96; to re-run the review service.

== Automating package updates: Packit

link:https://packit.dev/[Packit] is a service that enables automated pull request creation for new upstream releases.
More information on configuring dist-git repositories to use Packit
can be found https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide[in the documentation].

Please remember to run impact checks before pushing updates.

== fbrnch: an advanced packager tool

If you maintain larger package sets or want additional features/checks over fedpkg and other tools (like fedora-review),
you can install link:https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fbrnch[fbrnch] (pronounced f-branch).
The link:https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fbrnch-1.4\&#35;readme[readme] file has an overview of its features,
but some of the main highlights are:

\&#42; automated parallel builds in dependency order in a sidetag
\&#42; easy scratch, mock builds, waitrepo, and merging for a package branch
\&#42; listing, creating and updating package reviews
\&#42; requesting new package repos and importing directly from package reviews
\&#42; updating sources and much more



= Common Rpmlint issues

This is a collection of information on dealing with rpmlint.
Note that the first thing you should do is use the \&#96;-e\&#96; option to rpmlint so that it provides additional explanatory text.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
rpmlint -e description-line-too-long

description-line-too-long:
Your description lines must not exceed 80 characters. If a line is exceeding
this number, cut it to fit in two lines.
----


The information provided here is not exhaustive.
It covers some scenarios for which quick fixes are known.
It is also not a 'fix-all' for every scenario and should be carefully considered within the context of building your RPM.
Some rpmlint warning should not be fixed for some packages, for example warnings about non-standard groups or users, or about setuid executables may be perfectly right for some packages.
You can see descriptions of various rpmlint issues in the files installed by package rpmlint under
\&#96;/usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rpmlint/descriptions/\&#96;.

For more information on rpmlint project look at
link:https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint[Rpmlint GitHub Project].

[[debuginfo_without_sources]]
== debuginfo-without-sources

\&#96;rpmlint -e debuginfo-without-sources\&#96; provides a good overall picture.
See also xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Compiler Flags].
To fix, make sure that debugging symbols are created and that they not are stripped so they are available for rpmbuild post-processing.

[[file_not_utf8]]
== file-not-utf8

Indicates that the text encoding of the specified file, usually a documentation file, is not in UTF8.

\&#42; Usually fixed by running \&#96;iconv\&#96; on the uncompressed file before installation.
See man page \&#42;ICONV(1)\&#42;. For example, to recode a file named AUTHORS encoded in latin-1, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
iconv -f iso8859-1 -t utf-8 AUTHORS \&gt; AUTHORS.conv \&amp;\&amp; mv -f AUTHORS.conv AUTHORS
----

or check the sample at the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Perl/Tips\&#35;file-not-utf8[Perl]
packaging tips page and
link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging_tricks\&#35;Convert_encoding_to_UTF-8[generic tricks] page.

[[hardcoded_library_path]]
== hardcoded-library-path

\&#42; Don't hardcode path in SPEC.
Use xref:packaging-guidelines::RPMMacros.adoc[macros] instead.


[[incorrect_fsf_address]]
== incorrect-fsf-address

\&#42; In all cases, upstream should be informed about this.
This is the only requirement with respect to this error.

The license file, usually COPYING, must \&#42;not\&#42; be patched for legal reasons.
Other files can be patched if deemed suitable.


[[incoherent_version_in_changelog]]
== incoherent-version-in-changelog

\&#42; Check the changelog entries. See also: xref:packaging-guidelines::manual-changelog.adoc[manual changelog guidelines] in the Packaging Guidelines.

[[invalid_license]]
== invalid-license

The value of the License tag was not recognized.

\&#42; Check xref:packaging-guidelines::LicensingGuidelines.adoc[Licensing guidelines]

[[invalid_soname]]
== invalid-soname

The handling of this error depends on ld.so's load path (the 'linker
path') and whether it refers to a private or public library.

The linker path is \&#96;%{_libdir}\&#96; + any path listed in \&#96;/etc/ld.so.conf\&#96; or
in a file in \&#96;/etc/ld.so.conf.d\&#96;.

Public libraries are libs expected to be used by other packages.
Other libraries e.g., plugins and functionality internal to the package are private.

We have four cases:

\&#42; The library is public.
Inform upstream about the issue and propose that they add or fix versioning, possibly by sending a patch.
Don't apply the patch until it's merged upstream to avoid upgrade problems.
\&#42; The library is stored outside the linker path.
In this case the error can be ignored.
\&#42; The library is private and stored in a directory included in the linker path.
If possible, move the library to another directory outside the linker path.
This might require patching build scripts.
\&#42; The library is private, stored in a directory included in the linker path and can't be moved.
Here, the library must have a name unlikely to clash with other libraries.
Consider filtering the Provides: to make sure the private library isn't visible.

The standard way to move a private library is to create a new directory under \&#96;%{_libdir}\&#96; e.g., \&#96;/usr/lib/myapp\&#96;.
Don't list it in \&#96;/etc/ld.so.conf\&#96; files!
Instead, use a rpath to let the application locate the library.

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2012-April/166104.html[thread on fedora-devel]

[[no_binary]]
== no-binary

The package should be of the noarch architecture because it doesn't contain any binaries.

\&#42; Add \&#96;BuildArch: noarch\&#96; to the SPEC file


[[no_documentation]]
== no-documentation

Indicates that rpmlint could find no files marked as \&#96;%doc\&#96;. There are
several instances where this is acceptable:

\&#42; The package really has no documentation.
This is rare and in general quite a bad idea; every package should have some sort of documentation and should at least have the text of their license.
However, some packages have internal help systems.
\&#42; All of the documentation was included in a -doc subpackage.
This would be rare as most packages should have some license text, a changelog or other information that is better placed in the main package instead of a -doc subpackage.
\&#42; This is a subpackage and the relevant documentation was included in the main package.
This often happens with the -devel subpackage, but you should at least double check to ensure that any of the package's documentation which is intended for developers is included in the -devel subpackage.

[[no_soname]]
== no-soname

Indicates that the specified shared library does not have an soname (\&#96;DT_SONAME ELF\&#96; field).
If an executable is linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field, when the executable is run the dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \&#96;DT_SONAME\&#96; field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
See man page \&#42;LD(1)\&#42;.

\&#42; See the relevant packaging guidelines at xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc\&#35;_downstream_so_name_versioning[Downstream soname versioning] for information on dealing with this.

See also:

\&#42; link:\&#35;invalid_soname[invalid-soname]

[[private_shared_object_provides]]
== private-shared-object-provides

----
W: python-dulwich.x86_64: W: private-shared-object-provides /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/dulwich/_objects.so _objects.so()(64bit)
----

\&#42; Many times this can be solved by following the procedure listed on
xref:packaging-guidelines::AutoProvidesAndRequiresFiltering.adoc[Auto Provides And Requires Filtering].

[[script_without_shebang]]
== script-without-shebang

\&#42; You forgot to unset executable bits on files reported by this error.
See also: link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging_tricks\&#35;Add_shebang[add shebang].

[[spurious_executable_perm]]
== spurious-executable-perm

Indicates that a file has the executable bit set while it probably should not.

\&#42; Unset the executable bit, for example \&#96;chmod -x README.md\&#96; in
the \&#96;%install\&#96; section of your spec file.

[[standard_dir_owned_by_package]]
== standard-dir-owned-by-package

This package owns a directory that is part of the standard hierarchy,
which can lead to default directory permissions or ownerships being
changed to something non-standard.

\&#42; You should not make Systems standard directory's to belong to your package.

[[unstripped_binary_or_object]]
== unstripped-binary-or-object

\&#42; Make sure binaries are executable.

[[unused_direct_shlib_dependency]]
== unused-direct-shlib-dependency

A binary is linked against a library but doesn't actually call any of the functions in it.
This often happens when linking against a library which uses pkgconfig; the pkgconfig file cannot know which specific functions your binary may need to call, so it tells you to link against all of the possibilities.

One fix for packages which use libtool is to put this in your \&#96;%build\&#96;
section after the \&#96;%configure\&#96; call:

[source,bash]
----
sed -i -e 's! -shared ! -Wl,--as-needed\0!g' libtool
----

Another fix for packages which use \&#96;%cmake\&#96; is to put this before call
\&#96;%cmake\&#96;:

[source,bash]
----
export CXXFLAGS='%{optflags} -Wl,--as-needed'
----

[[wrong_file_end_of_line_encoding]]
== wrong-file-end-of-line-encoding

The file has incorrect end-of-line encoding, usually caused by creation or modification on a non-Unix system.
It could prevent the file from being displayed correctly in certain circumstances.
UNIX and Linux use the Line-Feed character , whilst Windows and DOS use both a Carriage Return and Line Feed .

\&#42; Strip the Carriage Returns by using \&#96;perl\&#96; or \&#96;sed\&#96;, using \&#96;dos2unix\&#96; is not
necessary. See man page \&#42;SED(1)\&#42;
