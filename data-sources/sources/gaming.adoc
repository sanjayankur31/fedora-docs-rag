DNF stands for Dandified Yum. It is the default package manager (software installer) for Fedora used to install, update, and manage RPM packages from official and third-party software repositories (online storage locations for software).

*Usage:* DNF lets you install native Linux games, game engines, libraries, and utilities that are not available as Flatpaks. It is also useful for installing Wine dependencies, performance tools, and emulator packages via the terminal. You can find more information in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/[Fedora Quick Docs - DNF]

A gaming emulator is software that mimics (copies the behavior of) the hardware of a video game console. It allows games from that console to run on a different platform like a Fedora-based PC. See also: xref:gameboy-emulator.adoc[Game Boy Emulator]

*Usage:* On Fedora, emulators such as RetroArch, PCSX2, and Dolphin can be installed via Flatpak or RPM packages. Gamers use them to run ROMs (game files) or ISOs (disc images) of console games. You can configure input, video, and audio settings to enhance compatibility and performance.



Flatpak is a software packaging and distribution format that runs applications in isolated containers to ensure compatibility across different Linux distributions.

*Usage:* Flatpak is commonly used to install and run emulators, game launchers, and indie titles from Flathub-the main Flatpak app store. It avoids dependency issues and sandboxes applications for security. You can manage Flatpaks via GNOME Software (graphical app store) or the command line (flatpak install, flatpak run).


An immutable Operating system(OS) is a Linux system where the core filesystem  is read-only. It prevents unintended or unauthorized changes to system files and ensures consistency across reboots. Think of it as a "locked down" system that's harder to break.

*Usage:* Fedora gaming variants like Bazzite or Fedora Silverblue use an immutable design to enhance system stability and security. Since the system is immutable, gamers typically install applications through Flatpak or use containerized environments like Distrobox for tools and scripts that need system access.


Lutris is an open source game manager for Linux that helps users install, configure, and launch games from various platforms, including native Linux titles, Windows games (via Wine or Proton) and emulators. It serves as a unified game launcher that handles the complex setup for you.

*Usage:* Lutris simplifies running games by managing different runtime environments like different Wine versions, graphics translation layers (DXVK), and dependencies (required files). It integrates with platforms like GOG, Epic Games, and Steam, and can be installed via RPM Fusion or Flathub. Essentially, it does the hard work so you don't have to manually configure each game.
You can find more information about https://lutris.net/about[Lutris] here.




NVIDIA drivers are closed source proprietary software made by NVIDIA, including kernel modules (low-level system components) and user-space software that enable full hardware acceleration and performance features for NVIDIA graphics cards on Linux.

*Usage:* Fedora gamers install NVIDIA drivers from the RPM Fusion repository because the default open source Nouveau driver has limited performance. These proprietary drivers offer better gaming performance and broader game support, and are essential for many gaming setups involving Steam, Proton, or Lutris.


Proton is a compatibility layer (translation software) developed by Valve that allows Windows games to run on Linux. It combines Wine with additional tools like DXVK and Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator(vkd3d ) to improve game compatibility.

*Usage:* Proton is built into Steam and can be enabled in the Steam Play settings. It lets you run many Windows-exclusive games on Linux without manual setup. You can select different Proton versions per game for better compatibility. Check ProtonDB to see how well specific games work with Proton.
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton[Proton], https://www.protondb.com/explore[ProtonDB]


RPM stands for RPM Package Manager. It is a package format (file type for software) and the underlying technology used by Fedora and other Red Hat-based distributions to install, upgrade, and manage software.

*Usage:* RPM packages provide access to native tools, libraries, and some games via DNF or direct download. You might use RPMs when installing performance tools, system utilities, or emulators that aren't available through Flatpak or Flathub.

"SIG" stands for Special Interest Group. These are informal teams within the Fedora Project that focus on specific areas of interest, like gaming, security, or documentation. The Fedora Games SIG works on improving gaming support in Fedora, so they're the people making Linux gaming better for Fedora users.


Steam is a digital distribution platform (online game store) developed by Valve. It provides access to a large library of games, as well as features like multiplayer gaming, game streaming, and mod support.

*Usage:* On Linux, Steam uses Proton to run Windows-based games that don't have native Linux versions. Steam can be installed via RPM Fusion (recommended) or Flatpak. It is your main gateway to playing both Linux-native games and Windows games (through Proton). You can configure graphical settings, performance options, and controllers through the Steam client.



Wayland is a modern display server protocol (communication system) that replaces the traditional X11 system. It provides a simpler, secure, and efficient way for your desktop environment to communicate with applications and your graphics card.

*Usage:* On Fedora, Wayland is the default session and works well with most games. Games run either natively under Wayland (via toolkits like SDL2 or Qt) or through XWayland for compatibility. The benefits include reduced input latency (faster response), better frame pacing (smoother gameplay), and stricter security isolation.


Wine is a compatibility layer (translation software) that enables Windows applications and games to run on Linux by translating Windows system calls (requests to the operating system) into POSIX-compliant calls (Linux-compatible requests). Wine stands for "Wine Is Not an Emulator" - it translates rather than emulates.

*Usage:* Wine can be installed via DNF or used within platforms like Lutris to manage game-specific configurations. It allows you to run Windows games that don't have Linux versions, though setup sometimes requires additional tweaks like DLL overrides (replacing Windows system files) or installing runtime dependencies (required Windows components). You can find more information about Wine in the following links:
https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/FAQ[FAQ],
https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Fedora[Fedora], https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Winetricks[Winetricks], https://appdb.winehq.org/[AppDB]



X11 (also called X Window System) is a display server protocol (communication system) that has historically been the standard for managing graphical user interfaces on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

*Usage:* Although Fedora and other distributions are transitioning to Wayland as the default, X11 is still widely used for gaming and applications that require compatibility. Many games, especially older ones, continue to rely on X11 for display rendering. Some gaming tools or environments may not yet fully support Wayland, so you might need to switch to an X11 session for certain games or applications.

Can I see a built preview of this template to get a better idea about the result?::

Of course you can! Just look at the README of the repository — it should tell you everything.

Is writing documentation hard and dreadful?::

Absolutely not. Writing documentation in asciidoc is simple and straightforward. In fact, writing documentation can be very fun. Just try and see for yourself!

How do I install a game not listed here?::

We are planning to add basic instructions on how to get started. You can contact us for more information. Help can be received from the Getting in Touch page on the left.

I have a great idea::

We welcome all new ideas and help. You can use the link at the bottom of this page or see xref:contributing.adoc[our contributing page].

NOTE: Fedora does not support some of these platforms out of the box due to
current policies, thus requiring some additional steps to use. The most common
need is setting up RPM-Fusion repository as instructed
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/[here]. And
setting up https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora/[Flathub].

Games can be installed and played in several ways, here are some of them:


=== Flatpak ===

Some proprietary but native Linux games have flatpak builds (RuneScape or
Minecraft.) Flatpak is an excellent platform for native proprietary games, and
pretty much any Linux app where you don't want the hassle of an RPM.

Below is a list of popular game launchers available as flatpak apps that you can install from Flathub


A popular FOSS Epic Games, GOG, and Prime Gaming launcher that uses Proton-GE: a custom version of Proton made by GloriousEggroll


A popular, FOSS Minecraft: Java Edition launcher with tons of features


Lutris is an Open-Source gaming platform for Linux. It installs and launches
games so you can start playing without the hassle of setting up your games.
Get your games from GOG, Steam, Battle.net, Origin, Uplay and many other sources
running on any Linux-powered gaming machine. Lutris is also available in the default
Fedora repos and the software stores, making it an absolute breeze to install.


Some of them are already packaged into Fedora. Most are available as Flatpaks.
Retroarch (combined frontend for a lot of older (pre-2000) emulators) is
trending these days. Retroarch is already in the repos. We also recommend Gnome
Games, a Retroarch frontend designed to better integrate with the GNOME Desktop.


These are game launchers that are better installed as native RPMs to avoid problems or quirks specific to their Flathub version.


Steam’s Proton is the single biggest thing that has boosted Linux gaming.
When anyone thinks of Linux gaming, they think of Proton.
Valve as a company has done a lot to encourage Linux gaming.
All of Valve’s self-published games are Linux native including Half Life Alyx
which is a VR title. You can see how to install Steam xref:proton.adoc[here]

NOTE: While Steam Proton is https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton[open source],
the Steam client is not.


There are many excellent open-source games as well! Try running
`dnf groupinfo “Games”` or checking out https://flathub.org/en/apps/category/game/1[Flathub's games list].

NOTE: This will require enabling an external repository.

NOTE: If you enabled "Third Party Software" (`rpmfusion Nonfree`) at installation you can skip to installing Steam.

NOTE: It is recommended that games are checked on https://www.protondb.com/[ProtonDB].
This will give an idea of how well a game might run under Steam on Fedora.


This will enable running of Game Boy games (which often have .gba extension)

=== Installation Using Software Installation Program ===

Generic instructions on installations can be found https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/finding-and-installing-linux-applications/[here].

On Gnome:

From _Activities_ menu choose _software_ and search for:
*VisualBoyAdvance-M*

Choose *install*

You can then find the program as *VBA-M* on your desktop (and alternatively under _Applications .. Games_, if you have applications menu enabled).

You can now choose Launch from the software installer.

=== Installation Using DNF ===

----
sudo dnf install visualboyadvance-m
----

=== Running the Emulator ===

From VBA-M choose file .. Open .. gba-file

You can choose (and verify) your game-keys from:
Options .. Input .. Configure

//We need to be cautious when writing documentation like this. The emulator.games link was unacceptable. See also: https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/

Below you can find dedicated articles for more complex topic, that may be required for you to fully enjoy gaming under Fedora OS.

This guide explains how to connect PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch controllers to Fedora for gaming. You’ll learn to pair controllers via USB and Bluetooth, and troubleshoot common issues.

== What are Controllers? ==
Controllers are input devices that interact with games on your computer. They can be wired (connected via USB) or wireless (connected via Bluetooth). Controllers provide a more tactile and immersive gaming experience compared to keyboard and mouse, especially for console-style games.

=== Installation Types ===
Controllers can be connected in two main ways:

* *Wired(USB)*: Using a USB cable to connect the controller directly to your computer.

* *Wireless(Bluetooth)*: Requires pairing and configuration.


== Playstation Controllers ==

=== DualSense 5 Controller ===

==== Via cable ====

Controller should work as soon as you plug it to your machine via USB cable.

==== Via Bluetooth ====

NOTE: There were identified issues with Bluetooth connection stability and input lag.

The guide below recommends connecting your controller using the `bluetoothctl` tool in the terminal. While you can still try to connect using the graphical Bluetooth manager, the method described below is suggested, as it is generally more stable.

1. Open your terminal

2. Run the `bluetoothctl` command and confirm that you see `[bluetoothctl]>` at the beginning of the new line. This means you are now using the bluetoothctl application.

3. Type `scan on` and press Enter to search for new devices.

4. Put your DualSense 5 controller into pairing mode:

* Press and hold the PlayStation button and the Share button (the smaller button on the top left side of the touchpad) simultaneously for a few seconds.
* The sides of the touchpad will blink quickly with a blue light, indicating that pairing mode is enabled.


5. Wait for the terminal to display your DualSense controller with its MAC address, for example:
+
----
[NEW] Device [MAC-ADDRESS] DualSense Wireless Controller
----
+
6. Start pairing by providing [MAC-ADDRESS] to the `pair` command:
+
----
[bluetoothctl]> pair [MAC-ADDRESS]
----
+
7. After pairing has been completed, enter the following command to connect to the DualSense 5 controller:
+
----
[bluetoothctl]> connect [MAC-ADDRESS]
----
+


===== Troubleshooting =====

*Problem 1:* I am unable to use the controller with the method described above.

*Solution:* Before pairing the DualSense 5 controller via Bluetooth, you may need to adjust the human interface device(HID ) protocol handling in the `/etc/bluetooth/input.conf` file.

Steps:

1. Find following line:
+
----
#UserspaceHID=true
----
+
2. Change it to::
+
----
UserspaceHID=false
----
+
3. Now you can start pairing process.

== Xbox Controllers ==

=== Xbox Series S Wireless Controller ===

This section describes how to connect a controller prepared for Xbox Series X|S to your machine.

==== Via cable ====

The controller should work as soon as you plug it into your machine via USB cable.

==== Via Bluetooth ====

1. Turn on your Xbox Wireless Controller.
2. Press the *Pair* button located at the back of the controller. The Xbox logo on the controller should start blinking rapidly, which implies that pairing mode has been enabled.
3. Go to the Bluetooth settings on your operating system.
4. Select *Xbox Wireless Controller* from the list. If you don’t see it, ensure pairing mode is enabled and use the "Search" option to refresh the list of available Bluetooth devices.
5. Accept the pairing request to connect your controller via Bluetooth.


===== Troubleshooting =====

*Problem 1:* I am unable to pair my controller via Bluetooth.

*Solution*

1. Install Xbox Controller Driver
You need to install additional Xbox Controller driver, available at repository https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo[xpadneo].
WARNING: The software mentioned below is maintained by a third party and is not related to Fedora. You are installing it at your own risk.
* Use the Copr repository to install the driver:
+
[source,bash]
----
dnf copr enable atim/xpadneo
dnf install xpadneo
----
+
2. Edit Bluetooth Configuration
* Open the Bluetooth configuration file (elevated access required):
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
----
+
* Find the following line:
+
----
#FastConnectable = false
----
+
Uncomment this line and replace `false` with `true`:
+
----
FastConnectable = true
----
+

3. Reboot and Test

* Reboot your machine after installation.
* Try to pair your controller again.




*Problem 2:* My controller disconnects after several seconds.

*Solution:*

1. Install the xpadneo driver from the previous section may resolve this issue.

2. You need to update your controller's firmware version. You can do this either:

* Via Xbox console, or
* Through the Microsoft Windows https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh30xj3?hl=en-US&gl=US[Xbox Accessories] application

NOTE: Currently, there is no way to update Xbox Controller firmware from Linux.

== Nintendo Switch controllers ==

=== Nintendo Switch Pro Controller ===

==== Via cable ====

Controller should work as soon as you plug it to your machine via USB cable.

==== Via Bluetooth ====

NOTE: There were identified issues with Bluetooth connection stability and input lag.

The guide below recommends connecting your controller via `bluetoothctl`. While you can still try to connect via a dedicated GUI Bluetooth manager, the method described below is recommended because it is more stable.

1. Open your terminal
2. Run the bluetoothctl command and confirm that you see `[bluetoothctl]>` at the beginning of the new line. This means you are using the bluetoothctl application.
3. Put your Nintendo Switch Pro controller into pairing mode:

* Press and hold the PlayStation button and the Share button (the smaller button on the top left side of the touchpad) simultaneously for a few seconds.

* The sides of the touchpad will blink quickly with a blue light, indicating that pairing mode is enabled.

4. Type `scan on` and press *Enter* to search for new devices.

5. Wait for the terminal to display your Nintendo Pro controller with its MAC address, for example:
+
----
[NEW] Device [MAC-ADDRESS] Pro Controller
----
+
6. Start pairing by providing `[MAC-ADDRESS]`to the pair command:
+
----
[bluetoothctl]> pair [MAC-ADDRESS]
----
+
7. After pairing has been completed, enter the following command to connect to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller:
+
----
[bluetoothctl]> connect [MAC-ADDRESS]
----
+


===== Troubleshooting =====

*Problem 1:* I am unable to use the controller using the method described above

*Solution:* Configure HID Protocol Handling

Before trying to pair your Nintendo Switch Pro controller via Bluetooth, you need to change the HID protocol handling in the /etc/bluetooth/input.conf file.

Steps:

1. Edit the configuration file (elevated access required):
+
[source,bash]
----
bashsudo nano /etc/bluetooth/input.conf
----
+
2. Find the following line:
+
----
#UserspaceHID=true
----
+
3. Change it to:
+
----
UserspaceHID=false
----
+
4. Start the pairing process using the method described above

=== Other controllers ===

Support may vary based on controller - please look into community boards for information, if your controller will be supported.

NOTE: This guide covers MangoHud installation, and basic configuration

== MANGOHUD ==

=== Introduction ===

image::mangohud.png[800, 600]

MangoHUD is a highly customizable overlay for OpenGL and Vulkan applications that displays real-time hardware information such as temperatures, power draw, clock speeds, and more. This makes it useful for monitoring system performance during gameplay and for diagnosing potential hardware bottlenecks.

=== Installation ===

==== Command Line Installation ====

MangoHUD is available in the Fedora repositories. You can install it using your favorite terminal with the following steps:

1. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install mangohud
----
2. Enter your password when prompted (note: no characters will be shown as you type).
3. Review the list of packages to be installed. You should see both `mangohud.i686` and `mangohud.x86_64`.
4. Type `Y` and press `Enter` to confirm.
5. Wait for the installation to complete — and you're done! MangoHUD is ready to use.

==== Graphical Install ====

MangoHUD can also be found in Fedora's graphical package managers such as GNOME Software and KDE Discover.

// TODO: Create a detailed step-by-step guide for MangoHUD installation using GNOME Software and KDE Discover.

[NOTE]
====
When searching for MangoHUD in a graphical package manager, you may see two versions:

* **Fedora (Linux)**: Installs MangoHUD system-wide, but does not support Flatpak apps.
* **Flatpak**: Works only with Flatpak applications.

Install the one that matches your use case — or both if you want full compatibility.
====

===== KDE Discover =====

image::mangohud_discover.png[width=100%]

On Fedora KDE Edition, open Discover and search for MangoHUD. You’ll see a system and a Flatpak version. Install both if you want MangoHUD support for system and Flatpak applications.

== Introduction ==

Gamescope is a compositor (specifically, a micro-compositor) developed by Valve that runs nested and isolated from the system’s desktop compositor. This allows for gaming-specific tweaks and features to be applied regardless of desktop environment support. Gamescope is also used by default on Valve's Steam Deck.

=== Features ===

Here are some of the well-known features of Gamescope tailored for gaming:

* Resolution spoofing to force a game to run at a specific resolution and/or aspect ratio for example, 4:3 screen ratio stretch
* Upscaling support regardless of native game support, including AMD fidelityFX super resolution (FSR) or NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS)
* ReShade support
* HDR rendering support
* Frame limiter (useful for games without a built-in frame limiter)

=== Requirements ===

To use Gamescope without issues, ensure the following requirements are met based on your GPU:

* AMD: Mesa 20.3 or newer
* Intel: Mesa 21.2 or newer
* NVIDIA: Proprietary drivers 515.43.04 or newer, or NVIDIA Open Kernel Module drivers

[IMPORTANT]
--
For users with recent NVIDIA GPUs, many have reported better performance and stability when using the NVIDIA Open Kernel Module drivers.

You can try installing the open driver using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install rpmfusion-nonfree-release-tainted
sudo dnf swap akmod-nvidia akmod-nvidia-open
----

NVIDIA users will also need to set the following kernel parameter for Gamescope to function properly:

[source,bash]
----
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='nvidia-drm.modeset=1'
----
--

// TODO Farhan: Need someone with NVIDIA hardware to verify as I only have AMD hardware.

== Installation ==

The Gamescope package is typically included during Steam installation as detailed xref:proton.adoc[here] and does not usually require further configuration.

If Gamescope is not installed, you can install it manually with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install gamescope
----

For Flatpak-based setups, install it using:

[source,bash]
----
flatpak install gamescope
----

== Usage ==

To run games with Gamescope, you need to prepend `gamescope` to the game’s launch command. For example, when launching from Steam:

----
gamescope -- %command%
----

To see the full list of available options, run the following in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
gamescope --help
----

Here are a few commonly used launch options:

* Run a game at 1920x1080 resolution fixed at 60Hz refresh rate:
+
----
gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -r 60 -- %command%
----

* Run a game with FSR upscaling from 720p to 1440p:
+
----
gamescope -h 720 -H 1440 -F fsr -- %command%
----

[NOTE]
====
Gamescope supports both AMD FSR and NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS). You can switch `-F fsr` to `-F nis` if you prefer to use NIS as the upscaler.
====

* Enable HDR rendering (requires compatible game and display):
+
----
gamescope --hdr-enabled -- %command%
----

* Enable variable refresh rate (VRR) on supported displays:
+
----
gamescope --adaptive-sync -- %command%
----

[TIP]
--
You can combine multiple options depending on your use case. It is strongly recommended to read the available options and their usage by running `gamescope --help` in your terminal.
--

CAUTION: The NVIDIA binary drivers are not maintained by the Fedora Project and may sometimes not be available for the kernel version included in Fedora.

NOTE: This will require enabling an external repository.

NOTE: If you enabled "Third Party Software" (`rpmfusion Nonfree`) at installation you can skip to Installing.

To game effectively when you have an NVIDIA graphics card, it is necessary for you to install the drivers first


* Launch The terminal prompt of your choice

* Run the following command with a user that has root acess or can use the `sudo` command

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm -y
----


* Run the following command with a user that has root acess or can use the `sudo` command

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia -y
----

NOTE: It is important to wait a few minutes for the driver to build properly before rebooting

* Reboot your system to load the driver


== Introduction ==
Overclocking has been a common practice among advanced users seeking to maximize the performance of their hardware. In the context of gaming, GPU overclocking is typically used to achieve higher frame rates, smoother gameplay, and improved performance in graphically intensive applications. Technically, GPU overclocking involves increasing the core and memory clock speeds of the graphics card beyond the manufacturer's default settings to enhance rendering capabilities and throughput.

[WARNING]
--
Overclocking your GPU can void manufacturer warranties, reduce hardware lifespan, and may cause system instability or permanent hardware damage. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.
This guide assumes you have a fundamental understanding of hardware overclocking and is intended for users who have experience overclocking on Windows and are transitioning to Fedora Linux.
--

== Overclocking Guide ==

=== AMD ===
The AMD GPU driver is built into the Linux kernel and comes preinstalled with every Fedora installation. However, advanced features such as clock and voltage adjustment are disabled by default.
To enable these features, you need to add the following kernel parameter: `amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff`
This setting unlocks access to performance tuning capabilities such as manual clock and voltage adjustments.
Use the following command to add the kernel parameter.

[source,bash]
----
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff'
----

To revert back and disable overclocking capabilities, you can use the following command.
[source,bash]
----
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args='amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff'
----

==== Overclocking Tools ====

Graphical tools for overclocking allow users to easily configure voltage and clock settings, fan curves as well as monitor temperature and power draw.
Below are several recommended tools to help you get started with GPU overclocking:

1. CoreCtrl - https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl
2. LACT - https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT

This guide will use *LACT* as the primary example for demonstrating the basic overclocking procedure.

NOTE: Regardless of the tool you choose, it is strongly recommended to read the official documentation to familiarize yourself with its features. This will help in diagnosing any issues that may occur during the overclocking process.

===== LACT Installation =====

image::lact.png[width=100%]

[NOTE]
====

==== Basic Usage ====

Overclocking principles in Fedora (and any other Linux distribution) are the same as on Windows using AMD Adrenalin Software. The basic idea of adjusting clocks, power limits, and voltages applies here as well.

The only difference that might be new for first-time users is the AMDGPU performance levels and AMDGPU power profiles. Below is a basic explanation of AMD performance levels and power profiles, along with what they are used for.

*Performance Levels*

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Performance Level |Description

|Auto
|The AMDGPU driver dynamically selects the optimal power profile based on load and power budget.

|low
|AMDGPU will force the GPU and memory clocks to stay at the lowest possible power state.

|high
|AMDGPU will force the GPU core and memory clocks to run at the highest available power state.

|manual
|User can choose which power profile to use and apply it to the GPU's power management. Power profile details are listed in the table below.
|===

*Power Profiles*

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Power Profile |Description

|BOOTUP_DEFAULT
|The default AMDGPU driver power parameter.

|3D_FULLSCREEN
|Power profile optimized for full 3D applications such as games.

|POWER_SAVINGS
|AMDGPU will try to use the lowest possible power state to save power whenever possible.

|COMPUTE
|Power profile optimized for compute workloads such as OpenCL and ROCm (e.g., local LLM inference).

|MANUAL
|User can manually adjust power profile parameters (for advanced users).
|===

===== Usage Example =====

Once LACT is installed and running, you can begin adjusting clock speeds, voltages, and applying power profiles. This section covers the basic steps to perform a safe and effective overclock using LACT.

NOTE: Always increase clocks and voltages gradually, and test for system stability after each change. Overclocking too aggressively can cause crashes or hardware damage.

--
1. Launch LACT from your application launcher.

2. On the main screen, you will see your GPU listed along with real-time stats such as temperature, clocks, voltage, and power draw.

3. Navigate to the *OC* section. This is where you can adjust the following parameters:
+
- `Maximum GPU Clock (MHz)`: Maximum targeted GPU core clock speed in MHz
- `Maximum GPU Voltage (mV)`: Maximum GPU core voltage in milivolt
- `Maximum VRAM Clock (MHz)`: Maximum GPU Memory clock speed in MHz

4. Start by increasing the GPU clock by a small increment (e.g., +25 MHz) and apply the settings. Do the same with the memory clock if needed.

5. Apply the changes by clicking the *Apply* button. The new values will take effect immediately.

6. Monitor your system for stability by running a game or benchmark. If the system is stable, you can try increasing the clocks slightly more. If it crashes or shows artifacts, dial back the settings.

7. Optionally, go to the *Power Profile* section and set the profile to `3D_FULLSCREEN` for gaming, or `COMPUTE` if you're doing compute-heavy workloads.

8. Once you find stable settings, you can save them as a profile in LACT for easy reuse.

--

NOTE: LACT applies settings only when the daemon (`lactd`) is running. To persist settings across reboots, make sure the service is enabled and your profile is saved.

TIP: You can use tools like `Unigine Superposition`, `Unigine Heaven`, or ingame benchmark to test performance and stability after applying overclock settings. You can use `mangohud` as detailed xref:monitoring.adoc[here] to monitor temperature and clock speed.

==== Fan Control ====

image::lact_fancurve.png[width=100%]

*LACT* also allows users to manually control their GPU fan curves, providing finer control over thermal management. Custom fan control can help reduce noise or improve cooling depending on workload and preference. The AMDGPU driver supports three different fan control modes, described below:

* `Automatic`: The AMDGPU driver automatically adjusts the fan curve according to the default settings defined in the GPU's VBIOS by the manufacturer.

* `Curve`: Users can define a custom fan curve based on temperature levels, enabling dynamic fan speed control.

* `Static`: Sets the fan to run at a fixed RPM, as specified by the user, regardless of GPU temperature.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling either `Curve` or `Static` mode may disable the "Quiet mode" or "Zero RPM" feature on certain GPU models. This means the fan will no longer stop spinning at low temperatures.
