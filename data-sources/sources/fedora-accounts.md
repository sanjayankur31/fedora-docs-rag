accounts](https://accounts.centos.org/)) choose the register tab, and
fill out your basic details:

![image](screenshots/newaccount1.png)

An email will be sent to your provided email address that includes a
validation link, follow this link back to validate your email, then set
your password:

![image](screenshots/newaccount2.png)

After setting your password you will be logged into your new account
automatically:

have two-factor authentication enabled, include a One Time Password from
your authenticator app:

![image](screenshots/reset_password3.png)

If successful, you should see the following message:

![image](screenshots/reset_password4.png)

\[&#35;twofactor\] == How do I add and use two-factor authentication?

Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts features the ability to configure and
user two-factor authentication through the user of OTP tokens. by
default, the system generates Time-based One-time Password (TOTP)
tokens, which can be used with authentication apps such as
[FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) (Android - Apple) or
[AuthenticatorPro](https://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro)
(Android).

To create an OTP token, go to the OTP tab in the user settings, and
click the &#42;Add OTP Token&#42; button:

![image](screenshots/otp1.png)

Next, add a name for the token and provide your password again.
Something descriptive like the name of the app you are adding the token
to might prove useful it you decide to add more tokens later:

![image](screenshots/otp2.png)

Your token is now created. Using your chosen authenticator application,
scan the QR code and add it to your app.

![image](screenshots/otp3.png)

Next time you log in, you will need to enter in your password followed
by the 6 digit OTP code generated by your chosen authenticator app.

\[&#35;pkinit\] == How do I get a kerberos ticket if I have two-factor

following error:

kinit: Pre-authentication failed: Invalid argument while getting initial
credentials

To configure your system to get a kerberos ticket for an account with
two-factor authentication enabled:

## 1. Install / Update &#96;fedora-packager&#96; {#_1_install_update_96fedora_packager96_5}

contains updates to ensure this procedure works with Fedora Accounts,
and adds &#96;krb5-pkinit&#96; as a new dependency of
&#96;fedora-packager&#96;
::::

&#96;fedora-packager&#96; provides a range of tools for fedora packagers

# Using Fedora Accounts {#_using_fedora_accounts_11}

\[&#35;newaccounts\] == How do I create a new account?

To create a new account, go to the home page (either for [Fedora
Accounts](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/) or [CentOS
accounts](https://accounts.centos.org/)) choose the register tab, and
fill out your basic details:

![image](screenshots/newaccount1.png)

An email will be sent to your provided email address that includes a
validation link, follow this link back to validate your email, then set
your password:

After setting your password you will be logged into your new account
automatically:

\[&#35;resetpassword\] == How do I reset my password?

To reset your password, navigate to the home page (either for [Fedora
Accounts](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/) or [CentOS
accounts](https://accounts.centos.org/)) and click on the \'Forgot
Password or OTP\' link:

![image](screenshots/reset_password1.png)

Fill in your username:

![image](screenshots/reset_password2.png)

Open the link from the reset email and enter your new password. If you
have two-factor authentication enabled, include a One Time Password from
your authenticator app:

![image](screenshots/reset_password3.png)

If successful, you should see the following message:

![image](screenshots/reset_password4.png)

\[&#35;twofactor\] == How do I add and use two-factor authentication?

Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts features the ability to configure and
user two-factor authentication through the user of OTP tokens. by
default, the system generates Time-based One-time Password (TOTP)
tokens, which can be used with authentication apps such as
[FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) (Android - Apple) or
[AuthenticatorPro](https://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro)
(Android).

To create an OTP token, go to the OTP tab in the user settings, and
click the &#42;Add OTP Token&#42; button:

![image](screenshots/otp1.png)

Next, add a name for the token and provide your password again.
Something descriptive like the name of the app you are adding the token
to might prove useful it you decide to add more tokens later:

![image](screenshots/otp2.png)

Your token is now created. Using your chosen authenticator application,
scan the QR code and add it to your app.

![image](screenshots/otp3.png)

Next time you log in, you will need to enter in your password followed
by the 6 digit OTP code generated by your chosen authenticator app.

\[&#35;pkinit\] == How do I get a kerberos ticket if I have two-factor
authentication enabled? When two-factor authentication is enabled on an
account (i.e. at least one OTP token is defined in your account),
additional configuration is required to get a kerberos ticket with
kinit. Running kinit without this configuration will result in the
following error:

kinit: Pre-authentication failed: Invalid argument while getting initial
credentials

To configure your system to get a kerberos ticket for an account with
two-factor authentication enabled:

## 1. Install / Update &#96;fedora-packager&#96; {#_1_install_update_96fedora_packager96_12}

Install / Update the &#96;fedora-packager&#96; package from the Fedora
repositories:

sudo dnf install fedora-packager

:::: note
::: title
:::

If you have previously installed &#96;fedora-packager&#96;, ensure you
update it to the most recent version
(&#96;fedora-packager-0.6.0.5-1&#96;) or later. The newest version
contains updates to ensure this procedure works with Fedora Accounts,
and adds &#96;krb5-pkinit&#96; as a new dependency of
&#96;fedora-packager&#96;
::::

&#96;fedora-packager&#96; provides a range of tools for fedora packagers
and contributors. It also provides krb5 configurations (in
&#96;/etc/krb5.conf.d/&#96;) for connecting to the FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
realm.

## 2. Request the kerberos ticket {#_2_request_the_kerberos_ticket_12}

:::: note
::: title
:::

This step is what you will need to complete from now on whenever you
request a Kerberos ticket
::::

Finally, request the kerberos ticket with the following command:

fkinit \--user &lt;username&gt;

You will be presented with the following prompt, be sure to &#42;Enter
your password first, followed by the OTP Token Value&#42;:

Enter OTP Token Value:

authentication will fail unless you enter your password, followed by the
OTP token value

## Brief History {#_brief_history}

The current iteration of Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts launched at
the start of 2021, and is an entirely new system that uses the Noggin
frontend, and FreeIPA behind the scenes.

![A screenshot of the CentOS Accounts web
UI](screenshots/centos-accounts.png)
::::

Prior to this launch, Fedora Project and CentOS contributors managed
their accounts using two seperate instances of the Fedora Accounts
System (FAS2) software, which came into service for the Fedora Project
in 2008.

After the migration to the new Fedora Accounts, a read-only version of
the Fedora FAS2 instance remains at
<https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/>

![A screenshot of the old FAS2 system](screenshots/fas2.png)

## Fedora and CentOS Accounts {#_fedora_and_centos_accounts}

Prior to the launch of Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts, both the
Fedora and CentOS communities ran seperate instances of the FAS2
software. A user that contributed to both communities was required to
have two seperate accounts.

With the migration away from FAS2 to Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts,
these services use the same FreeIPA backend, and each community has its
own branded frontend. Additionally users that had accounts on both the
Fedora FAS2 and CentOS FAS2 have had their accounts merged in the new
system.
