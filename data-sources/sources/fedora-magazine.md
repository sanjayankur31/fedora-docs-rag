[Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org) is a *WordPress-based*
site which delivers all the news of the Fedora Community. (It replaced
the older publication, Fedora Weekly News.)

# What does the Magazine publish? {#_what_does_the_magazine_publish}

The content of the magazine varies, but mostly includes:

&#42; General Announcements / News &#42; Tips on how to use software in
Fedora &#42; Ideas for cool apps to try &#42; Ways to more effectively
develop software using Fedora &#42; DIY hardware projects you can power
with Fedora &#42; &#8230; And everything else related to Fedora in
general!

# Join the Magazine Team {#_join_the_magazine_team}

We really need your help on the Magazine. Consider [writing an
article](contributing.xml). There is also a detailed guide on how to
make a post on the magazine.

We also have regular [editorial board meetings](editorial-meetings.xml)
on chat.fedoraproject.org. See the [Meeting and Publication
Schedule](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/meeting-and-publication-schedule/34554)
for exactly when and where.

We also have two areas on the discussion.fedoraproject.org forum for
Fedora Magazine topics. One section (under the *Team Workflows*
category) is reserved just for article proposals. When you start a new
topic there, the post should be pre-populated with a simple outline that
you can complete to make a new proposal. The other area is for anything
else related to Fedora Magazine. These can be posts about the site
theme, the tools and platforms being used in the workflow, when weekly
meetings will be held (or skipped), or anything else. All
non-article-proposal posts concerning Fedora Magazine should be tagged
with the special *&#35;magazine* tag.

# Fedora Magazine Editorial Workflow {#_fedora_magazine_editorial_workflow}

![fedora magazine workflow](fedora-magazine-workflow.jpg)

Content on the Fedora Magazine is created using a five-step workflow:

1.  [Article Proposal](workflow-article-proposal.xml) by Anyone

2.  [Clarification](workflow-clarification.xml) by Editors

3.  [Writing](writing-an-article.xml) by a Writer

4.  [Review](workflow-review.xml) by Editors

5.  [Edit &amp; Image](workflow-edit-image.xml) by Editors

An initial proposal lands in the *idea* state. After some clarification,
a specific article goes through five states. Starting as an *idea*, it
progresses to *in progress*, *review*, *to edit*, and finally ending up
being *scheduled*. Each step in the workflow has its own page in this
documentation that provides guidance.

## Tracking {#_tracking}

Article proposals in are initiated and discussed under the *Team
Workflows* section of the [Fedora Magazine Discourse
forum](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/workflows/magazine/57).
Everyone is welcome to submit one!

Articles in all other states are represented as cards in the [Kanban
section of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).
Each state has its own column on the board with the appropriate title.

Join our team either as a [writer](contributing.xml) or as an
[editor](editorial.xml) and help us make wonderful content read by tens
of thousands of readers every week!

# Proposing Articles {#_proposing_articles}

![fedora magazine workflow 1](fedora-magazine-workflow-1.jpg)

Anyone is welcome to propose an article!

Proposals can be ideas or specific pitches (an example is below).
Proposing an article doesn't automatically mean the same person needs to
write it. Having a good set of ideas helps writers to write what they
know is relevant for the Magazine.

## Submitting an idea {#_submitting_an_idea}

Join the community on the [Fedora Magazine Discourse
forum](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/new-topic?category=workflows/magazine)
and submit your idea as a new topic.

If this is your first proposal, and you also plan to write an article,
you can help us speed the process up by logging into our [Kanban section
of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles) ---
Select the *Log In* button to log in with your Fedora Account. That is
required before an article can be assigned to you.

## A specific pitch example {#_a_specific_pitch_example}

*The following article serves as an example outline for proposing a new
pitch for the Fedora Magazine. This example was used for the [Never
leave IRC again with
ZNC](https://fedoramagazine.org/never-leave-irc-znc/) article.*

&#42;&#42;Summary&#42;&#42;: Describe how to set up an IRC bouncer using
ZNC

&#42;&#42;Description&#42;&#42;: The purpose of this article would be to
describe what an IRC bouncer is and how someone can set up their own ZNC
instance to connect to IRC networks and remain persistently connected to
channels. The article would aim to educate the user about two things:
what and how. Since IRC is a major communication platform for Fedora
(and most free and open-source project communities), this article would
ideally promote using IRC as well. The flow of the article would be as
follows:

&#42; What is an IRC bouncer / proxy and how does it work? &#42;
Introducing ZNC &#42; Download, installing, and configuring ZNC on a
Fedora machine &#42; Configuring IRC client to use your ZNC bouncer

## Workflow {#_workflow}

&#42;&#42;Next step:&#42;&#42;
[Clarification](workflow-clarification.xml)

# Clarifying Proposals {#_clarifying_proposals}

![fedora magazine workflow 2](fedora-magazine-workflow-2.jpg)

The Editorial Board reviews each proposal and creates a specific article
description.

Proposals might be discussed with the person who proposed them, with
subject matter experts, and anyone who wants (or has the technical
ability to) give an input. We encourage anyone in the community to
provide feedback to the proposals!

## Discussing and approving proposals {#_discussing_and_approving_proposals}

Proposals are submitted to the [Fedora Magazine Discourse
forum](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/workflows/magazine/57) as
topics, and discussion happens right there.

Opinions and additional relevant information is welcome from anyone.

If an editor is happy with the proposal, all they need to do is to reply
\'+1\'. Proposals with two or more +1's are approved.

When a proposal is approved, a new card is created by an editor in the
[Kanban section of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles) in
the *ideas* column.

When the card is created, and the author is known, the owner is assigned
in the *Assignee* field under the METADATA column. This ensures the
author is emailed when the card status changes. This operation is
performed by the editor.

This card now represents a specific article and goes through all the
other steps of the workflow.

&#42;&#42;Previous step:&#42;&#42; [Article
Proposal](workflow-article-proposal.xml)

&#42;&#42;Next step:&#42;&#42; [Writing](writing-an-article.xml)

# Writing Articles {#_writing_articles}

![fedora magazine workflow 3](fedora-magazine-workflow-3.jpg)

Anyone with good writing skills is welcome to write an article for the
Fedora Magazine!

*Writing an article requires write access to our [Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles) (so
you can indicate progress and exchange information with the editors) and
to our [Wordpress instance](https://fedoramagazine.org/admin) (where the
articles are written). Read the [Getting Access](getting-access.xml)
page for more information.*

## Writing an article {#_writing_an_article}

### 1. Choose what to write {#_1_choose_what_to_write}

&#42;&#42;Choose&#42;&#42; any article you like in the *ideas* column in
the [Kanban board of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles). Or,
[propose your
own](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-magazine/workflow-article-proposal/).

&#42;&#42;Assign&#42;&#42; Open a topic, if necessary in the the [Fedora
Magazine Discourse
forum](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/new-topic?category=workflows/magazine),
and let the editors know you would like to be the author of an article.
Make certain you tell them the number. If you have been in contact with
the editors regarding an article, simply let them know in your ongoing
conversation.

The editors will assign the article to you and move it to *in-progress*
in the [Fedora Magazine Kanban
board](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

### 2. Write it {#_2_write_it}

&#42;&#42;Write&#42;&#42; your article [in the Magazine
Wordpress](https://fedoramagazine.org/admin) (create a new article
there). Read the [Writing Guidelines](writing-guidelines.xml) page for
specific guidance about our preferred writing style.

[Here's a template you can
use](https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-structure-your-article/) to
structure your article well, and make it as useful as possible to
readers. Make sure you set the article status from *Pitch* to *Draft*
once you receive approval.

As you write your draft, try to understand and follow the [style,
grammar, and SEO guidelines](writing-guidelines.xml) for the Magazine.
Don't skip this step! The guidelines tell you how to use markup, write
better sentences, and get your article ranked well in search engines.
Also, if you write a better article, the editors are more likely to
publish it sooner.

### 3. Mark it as done {#_3_mark_it_as_done}

When you feel you are done writing the article and it is ready for
review, state that in a comment on your card in Pagure. The editors will
move it to *review* in the Kanban board. Please make certain you include
a link to the WordPress preview for your article in the comments on the
card so the Editors can access it.

And that's it!

Please note that in some cases the editors might require a change in
your article. In that case, you'll receive feedback in the card, and it
will be moved back to the *in-progress* column. Please make the
requested change and let the editors know in the comments. They will
move it back to *review*.

&#42;&#42;Next step:&#42;&#42; [Review](workflow-review.xml)

# Reviewing Articles {#_reviewing_articles}

![fedora magazine workflow 4](fedora-magazine-workflow-4.jpg)

The Editorial Board makes a decision whether the article is ready to go.

## Reviewing an article {#_reviewing_an_article}

Articles that are ready for review are in the *review* column in the
[Kanban board of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

### When article is good to go {#_when_article_is_good_to_go}

If the article is good to go, a member of the Editorial Board simply
moves it to the *to-edit* column in the [Kanban
board](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

### When article needs changes {#_when_article_needs_changes}

If the article needs changes, a member of the Editorial Board provides
feedback in the comments section of the respective card, and moves it
back to the *in-progress* column in the [Kanban
board](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

Image](workflow-edit-image.xml)

# Editing and Creating Images {#_editing_and_creating_images}

![fedora magazine workflow 5](fedora-magazine-workflow-5.jpg)

Before an article can be published, it needs to be edited, and it needs
a cover image.

Members of the Editorial Board provide both of those.

## Editing {#_editing}

Articles that require editing are in the *to-edit* column in the [Kanban
board of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

Since multiple people will be potentially completing this step, they
need to coordinate with comments on the card.

The editors will &#42;&#42;Edit&#42;&#42; the article for potential
grammatical and spelling errors. When done, they indicate that in the
comments.

If the cover image has also been done that will be indicated in the
comments as well and the *needs-image* tag will be removed from the
METADATA column.

## Creating a cover image {#_creating_a_cover_image}

Articles that require a cover image are in the *to-edit* column in the
[Kanban board of the Fedora Magazine
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).

Since multiple people will potentially be completing this step, they
need to coordinate with comments on the card.

To &#42;&#42;Create a cover image&#42;&#42; for the article, see the
[Creating a featured image](creating-an-image.xml) page for
instructions. This function is usually done by an editor but the author
may take on this task if they have a specific idea. Please carefully
read over [Creating a featured image](creating-an-image.xml) for
restrictions on form and source for any image used.

When the image is done this will be indicated in the comments and the
*needs-image* tag will be removed from the METADATA column by an editor.

The Fedora Magazine editors monitor this Discourse forum and will be
able to help you and answer any Fedora Magazine related questions.

# Tips for article style, grammar, content, and SEO {#_tips_for_article_style_grammar_content_and_seo}

These tips will help your article sail through editing. Be kind to your
editor(s), and read this before you start.

## Markup {#_markup}

Primary rule: don't get too fancy. Legibility is important.

1.  &#42;&#42;Don't mix monospace fonts with proportional fonts in a
    sentence.&#42;&#42; Use italics for the special text. For instance,
    don't write &#96;dnf install foo&#96; in the middle of a sentence,
    write *dnf install foo*.

2.  &#42;&#42;Use italics for system objects you mention in a
    sentence:&#42;&#42; &#42;&#42; GUI or CLI elements like button text
    or menu entries &#42;&#42; other prompts the reader must find on the
    screen &#42;&#42; commands or package names

3.  &#42;&#42;Use the Preformatted style in the WordPress editor for
    command line input or output.&#42;&#42; Use a shell prompt (\$ or
    &#35;) only where it genuinely affects the meaning, or to set the
    input apart from output. It also helps to use boldface for the input
    itself:

        $ \*\*command arg1 arg2\*\*
        output line 1
        output line 2

4.  &#42;&#42;Use boldface only for an extremely important phrase or
    statement.&#42;&#42;

## Grammar and style tips {#_grammar_and_style_tips}

1.  &#42;&#42;Use sentence case for the post title and heading
    titles.&#42;&#42; Don't capitalize words in your article title or
    any heading, other than proper nouns. This avoids needless arguments
    about title case, which differs by region. &#42;&#42; Incorrect
    heading: *Use Sentence Case for Post Titles in Fedora Magazine*
    &#42;&#42; Correct heading: *Use sentence case for post titles in
    Fedora Magazine*

2.  &#42;&#42;Check spelling and grammar.&#42;&#42; Nobody likes
    nitpicky comments about this. Check your work before you send it to
    an editor. Editors: double-check all the work, that's your job!

3.  &#42;&#42;Write clearly and use shorter sentences.&#42;&#42; Brevity
    is good. Clarity is better. Don't be excessively wordy when
    avoidable. If a longer sentence is easier to read, use the extra
    words.

4.  &#42;&#42;Avoid passive voice.&#42;&#42; Passive voice is the use of
    the object of a sentence as the subject. For example: &#42;&#42;
    *Active voice*: The troops defeated the enemy. &#42;&#42; *Passive
    voice*: The enemy was defeated by the troops.

5.  &#42;&#42;Be careful of gerunds (-ing words).&#42;&#42; They usually
    indicate passive voice. Rewrite your sentence to make it stronger.
    For example: &#42;&#42; *Weak, passive voice*: Setting the foobar
    configuration option will make the application listen on all
    interfaces. &#42;&#42; *Strong, active voice*: Set the foobar
    configuration option to make the application listen on all
    interfaces.

6.  &#42;&#42;Avoid unnecessary future tense.&#42;&#42; Unless you're
    actually talking about future plans or publications, present tense
    is best. &#42;&#42; *Unnecessary future tense*: When you select
    &#42;&#42;Run&#42;&#42;, your program will start. &#42;&#42;
    *Present tense*: When you select &#42;&#42;Run&#42;&#42;, your
    program starts.

7.  &#42;&#42;Avoid too much use of the verb *to be* in
    sentences.&#42;&#42; Too much use of is, will be, or can be makes
    your sentences weak and flabby. Try using the verb form of words
    you've shuffled off elsewhere in the sentence. Often you can simply
    drop words, or use the imperative (commanding or advising) form of
    the sentence. &#42;&#42; *Weak*: Zambone is an app used for managing
    your private documents on a server. &#42;&#42; *Strong*: Zambone
    manages your private documents on a server. Or: Use Zambone to
    manage your private documents on a server. &#42;&#42; *Weak*: When
    setting up a file server, it is important to plan the directory
    structure carefully. &#42;&#42; *Strong*: Plan the directory
    structure of the file server carefully before you set it up.

8.  &#42;&#42;Use standard US English for spelling and other
    international differences.&#42;&#42; US English is the lingua franca
    for the Fedora Project overall.

9.  &#42;&#42;Have a smooth flow from general information to specific
    instructions.&#42;&#42; If you're not sure how to structure your
    article like this, check out our starter template.

## Content tips {#_content_tips}

These tips are about things to do --- and avoid --- in what you tell
users to do. Remember that thousands of readers trust Fedora Magazine to
tell them how to carry out tasks. Be responsible and helpful, advocate
best practices, and respect the user's security and choice.

1.  &#42;&#42;Leave packaged files alone.&#42;&#42; Processes should not
    involve editing files under system folders like */usr* or
    */lib&#42;*. Edit */etc* or a user-specific configuration in the
    home directory.

2.  &#42;&#42;Prefer free software where practical (and officially
    packaged software wherever possible).&#42;&#42; The Magazine can
    still cover non-FOSS software to be used on Fedora, where we know or
    suspect that software is very popular and useful to Fedora users.
    (Google Chrome is a good example.) But if your article is covering a
    general process, use FOSS software.

3.  &#42;&#42;Use libvirt/KVM in tips, not VirtualBox or other
    hypervisors.&#42;&#42; Frequently people coming from other platforms
    have VirtualBox experience. However, the KVM hypervisor and libvirt
    in Fedora are FOSS and part of the platform. Use them, write about
    them, love them.

4.  &#42;&#42;Unless necessary, use Fedora family
    distributions.&#42;&#42; The Fedora Magazine promotes Fedora. Unless
    the point of your article is to specifically explain a
    cross-distribution mechanism, use installations, containers, or
    distributions within its family (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL).

5.  &#42;&#42;Copr software must be accompanied by a caveat.&#42;&#42;
    The Copr build system is not managed by the Fedora release team and
    does not provide official software builds. If you cover some
    software from Copr, ensure there's no official build. If not,
    include a statement like this: *Copr is not officially supported by
    Fedora infrastructure. Use packages at your own risk.*

6.  &#42;&#42;Avoid exclusionary or problematic language.&#42;&#42;
    These are examples of terminology to avoid wherever possible in
    articles:

    a.  &#42;&#42;blacklist/whitelist&#42;&#42; --- Use
        *allowlist/denylist* instead, which is more directly descriptive
        of the purpose.

    b.  &#42;&#42;master/slave&#42;&#42; --- Use *primary/secondary*,
        *primary/replica*, *active/passive*, *active/standby*, or
        another similar construct.

7.  &#42;&#42;Test your process.&#42;&#42; If possible, use a fresh
    guest VM --- or at least a brand-new user account. Run your process
    from beginning to end to ensure it works. Fix, rinse, and repeat.

8.  &#42;&#42;Use the correct style for third parties.&#42;&#42; Names
    of companies, projects, and technologies don't always follow the
    style rules of typical English words. Choose the styling used by
    authoritiative websites when you're unsure. If authoritaive sources
    use inconsistent style, use your best judgment. A non-exhaustive
    list:

    a.  &#42;Copr&#42; instead of *COPR*

    b.  &#42;NVIDIA&#42; instead of *Nvidia* or *nVidia*

    c.  &#42;Perl&#42; instead of *PERL*

    d.  &#42;Red Hat&#42; instead of *Redhat* or *RedHat*

    e.  &#42;ThinkPad&#42; instead of *Thinkpad*

## Image and screenshot tips {#_image_and_screenshot_tips}

1.  &#42;&#42;Use a fresh, standard Fedora Workstation&#42;&#42;, not
    your personal desktop or setup. (It's best to make a VM with a fresh
    Fedora Workstation install, and do the steps there.) If you're
    showing something that &#42;relies&#42; on another desktop, do a
    fresh installation and use that.

2.  &#42;&#42;Set screen resolution at a reasonable but not too high
    resolution&#42;&#42;, such as 1280x960 or 1280x800.

3.  If you're only showing a browser window, make it fairly large on the
    screen and &#42;&#42;screenshot only the browser&#42;&#42;. (Hint:
    you can use the Screenshot app for this!)

4.  If you're only showing an application, &#42;&#42;use the default
    size of the app to screenshot it&#42;&#42;.

5.  &#42;&#42;Upload and use that original media in your
    article.&#42;&#42; If the shot is large, like a large browser
    window, app, or whole screen, choose a medium size thumbnail and let
    WordPress handle the conversion.

## WordPress tips {#_wordpress_tips}

1.  &#42;&#42;Use a simple, relevant title.&#42;&#42; Preferably this
    should be a call to action, like *Build a widget using GTK+*, or a
    list description, like *5 fun games in Fedora*. The title affects
    search engines, and leads to more hits and higher page ranking. That
    helps drive traffic to the Magazine.

2.  &#42;&#42;Provide a featured image.&#42;&#42; Look at [the
    information
    here](https://fedoramagazine.org/creating-a-featured-image-for-a-fedora-magazine-article/)
    for tips on featured images. You can also feel free to ask the
    editors to assign this for you. If you make your own image, try to
    match the style of other images. Use the assets provided [in the
    featured image
    guide](https://fedoramagazine.org/creating-a-featured-image-for-a-fedora-magazine-article/).
    Don't add your own fonts or deviate from the guide.

3.  &#42;&#42;Use good SEO practices.&#42;&#42; Use the SEO plugin
    provided to maximize the search ranking of the article. Aim for a
    "green" rating in the *Publish* box at top right of your article's
    edit screen. Follow these guidelines: &#42;&#42; Enter a meaningful
    keyword in the SEO box under your article. (Most articles shouldn't
    use *Fedora*.) &#42;&#42; If the Snippet doesn't give an effective
    introduction or summary in the sample search result, rewrite it.
    &#42;&#42; Don't feel like you have to eliminate every warning. A
    "green" rating overall is the only goal.

4.  &#42;&#42;Use the Edit as HTML option when pasting into preformatted
    blocks.&#42;&#42; Current versions of WordPress are known to strip
    leading hash marks (&#35;) and leading whitespace when content is
    pasted into preformatted blocks. Some non-alphanumeric characters
    may also get garbled (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, etc.). Using the *Edit as
    HTML* option (listed under the vertical ellipsis) prior to pasting
    content into the block seems to workaround this problem. Be sure to
    paste your content between the &lt;pre&gt; tags and do not overwrite
    them. After pasting your content, switch back to visual mode by
    using the *Edit visually* option to see a better representation of
    what the final result will look like to the reader.

# Creating a featured image for the Fedora Magazine {#_creating_a_featured_image_for_the_fedora_magazine}

Each article in the Fedora Magazine must have a featured image. The
image gives the article added visual appeal. It also appears in links on
social media, to attract more viewers.

These images are created as SVG (scalable vector graphic) images. To
work with these images, you should install a SVG capable application
such as Inkscape. You will also need the git utility installed.

Watch the [Creating Featured Images Workshop
video](https://youtu.be/F6Nf1gsR9S4) on our YouTube channel for a visual
demo of the guidelines and instructions below, plus some additional
Inkscape tips.

## Important guidelines {#_important_guidelines}

&#42; Only use the Fedora logo occasionally, such as for important
announcements, or to indicate a project affinity. &#42; Do not use logos
from other projects. Most require permission for use, and it is
difficult to assign a recipient for permission in a group-owned project
like the Magazine. &#42; Only use acceptably licensed pictures, photos,
or screenshots, or ones that you have made yourself and thus can
contribute with such a license. *(More on this below.)*

## Getting the image repository {#_getting_the_image_repository}

Open a Terminal. (You'll type commands into the terminal for some of the
following steps.)

Install the git and inkscape packages if you don't have them installed
already:

\$ sudo dnf install git inkscape

Fork the image repository at
[fedoramagazine-images](https://pagure.io/fedoramagazine-images) .

## Creating a new image using the template {#_creating_a_new_image_using_the_template}

Open Inkscape, and choose File &gt; Open... (or hit Ctrl+O). Navigate to
the project folder, then into fedoramagazine-images, then into images.
Choose the template.svg file.

Save this as a new file with a different name.

You can use the assets inside this file to start with the right-sized
document, with some pre-configured backgrounds. Feel free to look at
other SVGs for guidance. If you don't have experience with these images,
try to stick with fonts and motifs that you see in recent banners. But
also feel free to experiment! For instance, use photographs (freely
licensed, such as CC-BY or CC-BY-SA) with a text overlay for a nice
look. [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) has a large library of
images in the public domain you can use to get started.

## Reusing an old image {#_reusing_an_old_image}

It makes sense to reuse an old image if there is a thematic link from
the previous article to the new one. Try to vary something about the
image, such as the text. If the background is abstract (not a photo),
consider rebalancing the color.

When you reuse an old image, be careful that you have all the correct
fonts installed. To see a list, you can run this command:

grep font &lt;IMAGE_FILE_NAME&gt; \| sed
\'s/^.&#42;font-family:\\(\[^;\]&#42;\\).&#42;\$/\\1/\'

You can ignore font names \'serif\' and \'sans-serif.\' Be sure to
install any fonts that you don't have on your system already, so the
image is rendered correctly both on your screen and when you build a JPG
later.

### Background images {#_background_images}

You can find compatibly licensed images at
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), or you can try other image search
engines. Be sure to choose only images with CC0, CC-BY, or CC-BY-SA
licenses. (Commercial and derivative uses must be permissible.)

### Dimensions {#_dimensions}

Before you import your background to the SVG, scale and trim it using
GIMP or another image editor to an 1890x800 size, and a JPG quality of
about 75-80%. This keeps the SVG from being too large --- it will reduce
the size from many MB to just a few hundred KB.

The SVG template contains guidelines to indicate what portion of the
cover image's edge might get clipped when the article is shared on
various social media sites. The portion that might get clipped is about
10% of the left and right sides of the image and about 13% of the top
and bottom. In the SVG template, the guidelines provide margins of
exactly 183 pixels on the left and right and 107 pixels on the top and
bottom for an image that is sized to 1890x800 pixels. This leaves an
interior region of 1524x586 pixels within which it is safe to place text
without concern that it will get clipped when the article is shared out
to other social media sites.

### Fonts {#_fonts}

There are a few fonts that are commonly used in featured images. You are
encouraged to use these fonts in your images to help featured images fit
into the general "theme" that other images follow. They are all freely
available at the links provided. The fonts we commonly use on the Fedora
Magazine are listed below.

1.  [Open Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans)
    (especially the \'Light\' variant)

2.  [Bungee](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bungee) (for a slightly
    technical but fun feel)

3.  [Oswald](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald) (for a more
    technical feel)

4.  [Josefin Slab](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/josefin-slab)
    (friendly with serifs)

5.  [Zilla Slab](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/zilla-slab)
    (friendly with serifs)

6.  [Grand Hotel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/grand-hotel) (for a
    fancy script-y feel)

7.  [Montserrat](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat)
    (friendly and Sans-like)

8.  [Roboto Slab](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto-slab)
    (friendly with serifs)

9.  [Molot](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/molot) (heavier font,
    feels technical)

To use these fonts on your Fedora system, either download the font and
unpack the OTF or TTF file (if required) into your \~/.fonts folder.
Then update your font cache:

\$ fc-cache

or, where the font is packaged, install it using the package manager

\$ dnf install open-sans-fonts vernnobile-oswald-fonts
mozilla-zilla-slab-fonts astigmatic-grand-hotel-fonts
julietaula-montserrat-fonts google-roboto-slab-fonts
typetype-molot-fonts

You will need to close and reopen Inkscape, GIMP, or other applications
to take advantage of the new fonts.

## Getting your work reviewed {#_getting_your_work_reviewed}

If you'd like to post your work somewhere, convert it to a JPG first.
This will typically be a smaller file. Make sure your SVG file is saved
in the fedoramagazine-images/images/ folder as above. Typically these
should be named after the article in some way to make it easier to find
images later. For this example, let's assume your SVG file is named
using-inkscape.svg.

Open a Terminal and go to the fedoramagazine-images/images/ folder:

\$ cd projects/fedoramagazine-images/images/

Now use the helpful make target we've provided. This creates the correct
sized (1890x800 pixels) JPG automatically, if you provide the same name
as your SVG file:

\$ make using-inkscape.jpg

Now you can post this file, using-inkscape.jpg, online, and then provide
that URL in the comments section of your article's Pagure card for
review.

If the image is approved, and if it might be reused for later articles,
then consider creating a pull request against the upstream repository to
have your work archived for reuse.

# Contributing as a Fedora Magazine Editor {#_contributing_as_a_fedora_magazine_editor}

The duties of an editor are much like any blog owner. Occasionally
editors also [contribute content](contributing.xml) when the queue or
backlog of content is running a little low. Editors take turns serving
as the [Editor of the Week](editor-of-the-week.xml).

Editors follow an [editorial checklist](editorial-checklist.xml) to help
articles meet a quality and content bar, and to ensure they're well
searchable.

Editors hold a [weekly editorial meeting](editorial-meetings.xml) to
discuss and approve content, help guide authors, and figure out ways to
improve the Magazine and further its mission. The best way to become an
editor is to join the weekly meeting, and demonstrate your ability to
contribute consistently.

Editors also [extend access to new
contributors](editorial-add-contributors.xml) so they can help with
writing, art, and sometimes even editing itself.

Like most blogs and news sites, the Magazine receives feedback and
comments from the public. Editors [moderate comments based on common
guidelines](approving-comments.xml). They ensure that discussions stay
constructive and discourage trolls and other bad actors.

# Fedora Magazine Editor of the Week {#_fedora_magazine_editor_of_the_week}

In order to promote accountability and spread the workload, we have the
Editor of the Week role for Fedora Magazine.

## Selection {#_selection}

The Editor of the Week will be selected by volunteer basis at each
week's Magazine Editorial Board meeting. Editors who cannot attend the
meeting can volunteer by contacting the current Editor of the Week prior
to the start of the meeting. If the meeting is canceled, the current
Editor of the Week should coordinate selection via the asynchronous
communication channel (i.e. mailing list or Discourse).

If multiple Editors volunteer to be the Editor of the Week, we expect
they can work it out among themselves. However, in general we should
prefer the volunteer who has least recently served as Editor of the Week
in order to fairly distribute the workload.

If no one volunteers, then the current Editor of the Week should request
volunteers via the asynchronous communication channel.

## Term {#_term}

The term of the Editor of the Week is one calendar week (beginning the
Sunday following the meeting where the Editor of the Week was selected
and ending on Saturday).

## Responsibilities {#_responsibilities}

The Editor of the Week is expected to:

&#42; Routinely moderate comments (2-3 times a day is ideal) &#42;
Ensure the publication schedule is followed &#42; Welcome new
contributors &#42; Convert approved proposals to Pagure cards &#42;
Chair the weekly [Magazine Editorial Board
meeting](editorial-meetings.xml)

Note that Editors who are not the Editor of the Week may still perform
the tasks above.

# Checklist for editors {#_checklist_for_editors}

Editors should follow this checklist to help articles meet standards
before being published.

## Special notes for release announcements {#_special_notes_for_release_announcements}

&#42; \[ \] Set the article slug to match the pattern
&#96;announcing-fedora-&lt;N&gt;&#96; for final releases and
&#96;announcing-fedora-&lt;N&gt;-beta&#96; for beta releases. This
pattern is expected for things like the CommonBugs templates in the
wiki. &#42; \[ \] Do &#42;not&#42; schedule the post. Release
announcements should be published manually after confirming the website
is up to date, etc.

In addition to the release announcement, each new release is accompanied
by articles describing new or changed features and other information. A
list of these articles and proposed publication dates can be found at
this site where XX is the current Fedora Linux release number:

https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-XX/f-XX-magazine-tasks.html

## Formatting {#_formatting}

&#42; \[ \] Ensure the author's first and last name appears in the
preview. If not, follow the instructions
[here](technical-wordpress.xml). &#42; \[ \] After the introductory
paragraph, include the *\-\-- Read More \-\--* element. This causes RSS
readers to visit the site to view the article. &#42; \[ \] Remove any
monospace text mixed into paragraphs, such as &lt;tt&gt; elements.
Either convert these to italics, or move them into Preformatted blocks
in WordPress, fixing surrounding text as necessary.

## Style {#_style}

&#42; \[ \] Check the article for adherence to the [guidelines for
writers](writing-guidelines.xml). &#42;&#42;This may take a while, so
leave yourself sufficient time for this step.&#42;&#42; &#42; \[ \] Set
all article and section titles to sentence case.

## Usage {#_usage}

&#42; \[ \] Eliminate use of *I, we, us,* and *our* in the article,
rewriting where necessary. Articles should not refer to the author if
avoidable.

## SEO and metadata {#_seo_and_metadata}

&#42; \[ \] Set an appropriate [focus
keyword](https://yoast.com/focus-keyword/). &#42; \[ \] Address any
article shortcomings that affect readability. (It may not be possible to
turn the readability score to \'green\' in all cases.) &#42; \[ \]
Categorize the article. The default \'Fedora Project community\'
category should rarely be used. &#42; \[ \] Add tags for article subject
matter. Use as many as possible. As you type a new tag, observe the
popup help. Try to choose relevant tags, and avoid creating new ones
with trivial differences. &#42; \[ \] Add an Excerpt in the document
details in WordPress. This shows up in the
[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed shown in [start page in
Fedora's web browser defaults](https://start.fedoraproject.org). &#42;
\[ \] Set the article slug. This should exclude common short words like
\'of\', \'and\', and \'the\'. The slug should give a sense of what the
article is about but be succicnt. Putting the focus keyword at the
beginning of the slug will make the SEO plugin happy.

## Featured images {#_featured_images}

&#42; \[ \] Make sure the article has an appropriate [featured
image](creating-an-image.xml). This is &#42;&#42;not&#42;&#42; the same
as an image in the article text itself, and should not appear there. Use
the Featured Image box in the document details in WordPress. &#42; \[ \]
Featured images should be captioned with an appropriate attribution if
they are not original or make use of third party components. &#42; \[ \]
Featured images &#42;&#42;submitted by the author&#42;&#42; should be
captioned using &#42;&#42;Contributed by:&#42;&#42; and indicate the
author's name. &#42; \[ \] Featured images should be included or
submitted to the [featured images repo on
Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedoramagazine-images). Refer to the
[documentation on featured images](creating-an-image.xml) for more
information.

## Publishing {#_publishing}

&#42; \[ \] Schedule the article to publish at 08:00 UTC (the Magazine
default timezone) on the selected day, unless decided otherwise. &#42;
\[ \] Schedule for &#42;&#42;Beta&#42;&#42; and &#42;&#42;General
Availability&#42;&#42; releases is approximately 14:00 UTC so the
article for those should be published at 14:00 UTC or a short time after
that on the selected day, unless decided otherwise. Ref. [Fedora Linux
Releases Life
Cycle](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/lifecycle/&#35;_development_schedule).
&#42; \[ \] For articles that are part of a series, it is necessary to
visit the post in WordPress AFTER it has been published and add the
series indicator. Refer to the section &#42;Adding an article to a
series&#42; in the [WordPress Operations](technical-wordpress.xml) page
for instructions.

# Fedora Magazine editorial meetings {#_fedora_magazine_editorial_meetings}

The goal of this meeting is to set and execute a publishing schedule of
appropriate material for the Fedora Magazine.

Meetings happen every week in the
[&#35;meeting-2:fedoraproject.org](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;meeting-2:fedoraproject.org?web-instance%5Belement.io%5D=chat.fedoraproject.org)
Matrix channel on chat.fedoraproject.org. See the [Fedora Magazine
Editorial board
meeting](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/meeting/10800/) in the
Fedora calendar. Meetings are chaired by that week's [Editor of the
Week](editor-of-the-week.xml). If the meeting time changes, be sure to
update the link in this paragraph.

## Chairing the meeting {#_chairing_the_meeting}

The meeting is powered by
[zodbot](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zodbot). You can use the
following commands the start the meeting, to set topics, record
important information and decisions, etc.

### Roll call {#_roll_call}

To start the meeting, run the following set of commands.

&#35;startmeeting magazine &#35;meetingname magazine &#35;topic roll
call &#35;chair glb rlengland theevilskeleton

People will then join using a &#96;.hello2&#96; or a &#96;.hello
NICK&#96; command.

### Agenda {#_agenda}

This is the standard agenda. Announcing it in advance helps newcomers
understand the structure of the meeting.

&#35;topic agenda &#35;link

### 1/ Last week's stats {#_1_last_weeks_stats}

&#35;topic 1/ last week's stats

First, let's look back at the previous week in terms of pageviews. This
data can be obtained in the [Fedora Magazine
Wordpress](https://fedoramagazine.org/admin). On the
[Dashboard](https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-admin/index.php), scroll down
to Stats by Jetpack.

&#35;info Week of &lt;MONTH DD&gt;: &lt;NN.N&gt;K
pageviews --- &lt;COMMENT&gt;

### 2/ In progress followup {#_2_in_progress_followup}

&#35;topic 2/ in progress followup &#35;info Looking at the \'in
progress\' column, is there something that's been finished? Anything to
follow up on with its author? &#35;link board:
<https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles>

Review anything that's in progress. If an article is stuck in progress
for a long time without an update, contact the author and ask them if
they still plan to finish their work.

Anything that's already finished and commented so by the author can be
moved to the \'review\' column.

You may also want to check the QA calendar for upcoming test days so
that we can expect a new post submission. These tend to come in with
very short notice, so the Editor of the Week should use their best
judgment in deciding when to publish.

&#35;info Are there any upcoming test days? &#35;link
<https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/QA/>

Also check the release schedule for upcoming tasks. This is generally
only important a few weeks before the Beta and Final releases, but it
doesn't hurt to check just to keep it in mind.

&#35;info Check the release schedule. &#35;link
<https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-&lt;N&gt;/f-&lt;N&gt;-magazine-tasks.html>

(where &lt;N&gt; is the release being developed)

### 3/ Finished articles to review {#_3_finished_articles_to_review}

&#35;topic 3/ articles to review &#35;info Looking at the \'review\'
column, let's decide which articles are good to go. Move each either to
the \'to-edit\' (finished) column or to the \'in-progress\' (needs more
work) column and provide feedback. &#35;link board:
<https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles>

Authors mark their articles as finished by adding a comment announcing
that fact. Review the articles and ether move them to the *to-edit*
column, or in case they need some additional work, ask the author in the
card about it and move it back to *in-progress*.

### 4/ Articles to edit {#_4_articles_to_edit}

&#35;topic 4/ articles to edit &#35;info Looking at the \'to-edit\'
column, assign an editor and a cover image creator. &#35;link board:
<https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles>

Assign an editor and a cover image designer to each article so it can be
moved forward.

### 5/ Publishing schedule {#_5_publishing_schedule}

&#35;topic 5/ Publishing schedule &#35;info Looking at the \'to-edit\'
column, decide the publishing schedule for the upcoming week. &#35;info
If there is not enough content, we might also need to look at the
\'in-progress\' or even the \'ideas\' columns to come up with additional
content. &#35;link board:
<https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles>

Setting the publishing schedule for the upcoming week period is one of
the main goals of this meeting.

Decide which articles should be published when and set the dates for
each card on the board.

The next step is to vote on the publishing schedule along with other
attendees of the meeting. A proposal of the schedule has the following
format:

&#35;proposed &#35;agreed PUBLISHING SCHEDULE: DAY DATE, NAME
(NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- DAY DATE, NAME (NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- DAY
DATE, NAME (NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- 

This can be generated by a script. Run:

\$ podman run \--rm -it asamalik/magazine-schedule

The script consumes data from the individual cards, so please make sure
the date, and the editorrial assignees are set properly.

Find more information about the script in the
[asamalik/magazine-schedule github
repository](https://github.com/asamalik/magazine-schedule).

When the schedule is set and agreed upon, announce it by:

&#35;agreed PUBLISHING SCHEDULE: DAY DATE, NAME
(NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- DAY DATE, NAME (NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- DAY
DATE, NAME (NICK:edit/NICK:image) --- 

### 6/ Editor of the Week {#_6_editor_of_the_week}

Before the end of the meeting, we need to select next week's [Editor of
the Week](editor-of-the-week.xml).

&#35;topic 6/ editor of the Week

Announce the volunteer using:

&#35;info XXXX will be Editor of the Week next week

### 7/ Open floor {#_7_open_floor}

&#35;topic 7/ open floor

### Meeting ends {#_meeting_ends}

&#35;endmeeting

### After the meeting {#_after_the_meeting}

Send the minutes to the forum. That includes the three links zodbot
prints out after the meeting is ended.

Subject: Editorial board meeting recap YYYY-Mmm-DD

## Exceptions {#_exceptions}

The following types of articles generally can route around the weekly
meetings. This helps us get critical information out to the audience
without waiting for the next board meeting.

&#42; &#42;&#42;Security updates:&#42;&#42; Critical security updates
that affect a broad user audience are pre-authorized. Generally an
editor will write the update article. If possible, one other editor does
a quick spot check. If that would affect the timing, however, the
posting editor simply publishes the article and notifies the magazine
list. An example is a Firefox security issue.

# Approving comments {#_approving_comments}

We moderate comments on the Fedora Magazine to make sure discussions
stay constructive and useful. Some sites do not moderate comments, which
usually results in spammers, trolls, or other bad actors creating a less
appealing environment. Fedora Magazine editors agree that:

&#42; The Magazine is not a public place, but rather is like private
property where we are holding an open-door event. &#42; We want the
Magazine to retain a high value to the public and the community --- in
other words, for all attendees to enjoy the event. &#42; We want to
discourage bad actors from creating a negative environment --- in other
words, that the event stays safe for everyone.

Most comments that come in are constructive. Even comments that are
critical can be constructive. However, some comments cross a line where
they stop being constructive. They may express hostility or include no
valuable ideas --- or simply may be spam.

Therefore, Magazine editors follow a common set of guidelines to approve
comments, and discard those that are not constructive. If you are
helping moderate comments, here are some guidelines to follow:

&#42; Comments that are critical of a technology or article are OK to
approve. However, they should offer alternative ideas or suggestions.
&#42; Comments that criticize an author, or are hostile to a class of
people, or put down Fedora in general should be discarded. &#42;
Comments that point to technologies Fedora doesn't ship are OK to
approve; the site has a legal disclaimer that says content expresses the
views of individual authors only. &#42; Comments that are indirect spam
should be discarded. You can usually recognize these comments because
they are very general, do not include any context from the article, and
include a product or other suspect URL as an author name and/or site.
&#42; Duplicate comments should be discarded. (Sometimes comment authors
don't read the text that tells them their comment will be held and
moderated.)

# Adding a Writer {#_adding_a_writer}

When a new writer joins the Magazine, they usually want to track their
work in our kanban.

1.  Ask the writer to login to [Fedora Magazine Pagure
    instance](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles)
    if they have not done so already. This will require that they have a
    Fedora Account System (FAS) login.

2.  Have the writer set up a Fedora Account, if they don't already have
    one. They can [sign up
    here](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/&#35;register). Remind them
    that contributors are required to sign the Fedora Project
    Contributor Agreement (FPCA).

3.  Find out the writer's Fedora Account System information. For
    instance, using [Zodbot](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zodbot) you
    can use the command &#96;fasinfo &lt;fas-username&gt;&#96;.

4.  Follow these instructions to [promote the
    account](technical-wordpress.adoc&#35;_changing_a_users_role) to the
    Author role in WordPress.

# Technical Notes and Processes {#_technical_notes_and_processes}

The Magazine site itself is simply a [WordPress
site](https://wordpress.org). Like any website, it may require
maintenance from time to time.

Pagure is the system used to track the status of cards (\'Issues\') for
the articles.

One system that sometimes requires changes or fixes is the [Magazine
theme](https://pagure.io/fedoramagazine-theme). There is a process to
[modify, test, and deploy theme changes](technical-theme.xml).

# Maintaining the Magazine Theme {#_maintaining_the_magazine_theme}

The Magazine theme is maintained in [a Pagure
repository](https://pagure.io/fedoramagazine-theme). If you want to
submit a change, start by forking and/or cloning this repository. This
page does not cover git workflow; consult [git
documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information, or ask the
Magazine staff for help.

## Testing your changes {#_testing_your_changes}

The &#96;build.sh&#96; and &#96;preview.sh&#96; scripts let you deploy
WordPress in a local container to test your work before you push your
changes to the live site. Ensure you are in the root of the cloned
repository and enter &#96;./build.sh &amp;&amp; ./preview.sh&#96; to
create and provision the container. This will take some time.

When done, you can point your local browser at <http://localhost:5055>
to see the theme with your local revisions. The container accesses the
contents of the repo directly, so you can edit changes in the repository
and quickly see them in action. To iterate on changes, after modifying
the theme, run &#96;podman restart wordpress&#96; from another terminal
window so the containers's web caching is cleared. Then refresh your
browser window (F5 or Ctrl+F5) to view the modifications.

When finished, press &#42;&#42;Ctrl&#42;&#42;+&#42;&#42;C&#42;&#42; in
the original terminal window from which you launched the container to
stop the container. Optionally, you can run &#96;./clean.sh&#96; to
remove all the contianer artifacts except for the repo itself from your
system. If you remove all the artifacts (WordPress plugins, databases,
etc.) it will take longer to run the &#96;build.sh&#96; and
&#96;preview.sh&#96; commands the next time because everything will need
to be re-downloaded and re-installed.

## Tagging the theme {#_tagging_the_theme}

Once the theme modifications are complete, you should make a release.
This means that anyone can return to this iteration of the theme in case
of a problem with a future version.

The last commit in your changes should be updating the
&#96;fedoramagazine/styles.css&#96; file to update the &#96;version&#96;
in the header:

    Theme Name: Fedora Magazine 2018
    Text Domain: fmag2018
    Theme URI: http://pagure.org/fedoramagazine-theme/
    Version: 1.03
    Description: The theme for the Fedora Magazine. This iteration first rolled out in March 2018

*(For theme committers:)* Apply a tag to this commit to mark it for
release, such as &#96;v1.03&#96;, and push the tag to the repo using
&#96;git push \--tags&#96;.

## Releasing the theme {#_releasing_the_theme}

While in the repo, run these commands to make a zip file in which to
deliver the theme. &#42;&#42;Remember to use the correct, new version
number in place of 1.03 below.&#42;&#42;

    $ ln -s fedoramagazine fedoramagazine-1.03
    $ zip -r /tmp/fedoramagazine-theme-1.03.zip fedoramagazine-1.03
    $ rm -f fedoramagazine-1.03

The resulting &#96;fedoramagazine-theme-1.03.zip&#96; is a release of
the theme.

## Installing the updated theme {#_installing_the_updated_theme}

This step must be done by someone with \'administrator\' rights in the
Fedora Magazine WordPress site.

Use the built-in functions to add a new theme. Upload the resulting
&#96;fedoramagazine-theme-1.03.zip&#96; file and activate it.

If you need to switch themes and get confused about which theme is
correct, the theme details will show you the version number.

# Pagure Operations {#_pagure_operations}

## Adding a new user {#_adding_a_new_user}

If an author has not accessed Pagure before, they must login with their
[FAS account](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/&#35;register). The
[Fedora Magazine site is
here](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles). They
will need to select the *Log in* button in the upper right corner of the
page. This will allow the editors to assign cards to them.

There is nothing more to do administratively.

## Creating a new card (user story) {#_creating_a_new_card_user_story}

When a proposal is approved, follow these steps.

1.  From the [Kanban
    page](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles),
    select the *New issues* button (upper right corner).

2.  Enter the title of the article in the top text box.

3.  Enter details of the proposal in the bottom text box. *Include a
    link to the proposal discussion*, where appropriate.

4.  If an author has been identified and has logged in to Pagure, select
    the *Assignee* text box in the METADATA column at the right and
    locate their name.

5.  Select *Create Issue* at the bottom of the page.

When the new issue has been created, continue with these steps.

1.  Select the *pencil icon* at the top of the METADATA column at the
    right.

2.  In the *Tags* selection field select *article* and *needs-image*.

3.  Select *Update* at the bottom of the METADATA column.

The new card should appear at the bottom of the Kanban *ideas* column.
If it does not you can add it by selecting the &#42;+&#42; at the top of
the *ideas* column and entering the new Issue number.

If you do not know the Issue number, select *Issues* at the top of the
Kanban page and locate it in the list of issues.

## Changing the state of the cards {#_changing_the_state_of_the_cards}

Authors must indicate, in the comments of each card, when they feel the
state needs to change from *ideas* to *in-progress* to *review*.

The editors will change the state by \'dragging\' the cards on the
Kanban page as needed.

The editors will determine when the articles are ready to move to
*to-edit*, drag the cards on the Kanban board, and add a comment to that
effect to inform the author.

## Adding editors {#_adding_editors}

Editors should be admins on the board. You must be an Administrator to
add an editor.

Use the following steps.

1.  On the Kanban page, select the *Settings* tab at the top of the
    Pagure page.

2.  Select *Users &amp; Groups* from the list in the left column on this
    page.

3.  Select *add user*.

4.  Type in the FAS Username in the first text field, to search. Note
    that the user must have logged into Pagure prior to this operation
    for the name to be available.

5.  Set the next field (a selection field) to *Admin*.

6.  Select *Add*.

## Removing editors {#_removing_editors}

You must be an Administrator to remove an editor.

Use the following steps.

1.  On the Kanban page, select the *Settings* tab at the top of the
    Pagure page.

2.  Select *Users &amp; Groups* from the list in the left column on this
    page.

3.  Locate the name of the admin to remove and select the red trash can
    icon at the right of the name.

Update the [Pagure group](https://pagure.io/group/fedora-magazine)
membership as well so that the docs and images repos have the correct
permissions.

# WordPress Operations {#_wordpress_operations}

## Adding a new user {#_adding_a_new_user_2}

Do &#42;not&#42; add new users manually. User accounts are created on
login with Fedora Account System credentials.

## User details {#_user_details}

We use real names on the Magazine for authors. This reflects
accountability for posts on a more official Fedora outlet.

Locate the user in the *Users* control panel, and select *Edit*. Switch
the default display of the user name to first and last name.

## User permissions {#_user_permissions}

We use the *User Role Editor* plugin to manage user permissions at a
fine-grained level. There are five roles in our WordPress instance:

&#42; &#42;&#42;Administrator&#42;&#42; This role has the ability to
make settings changes and conduct other administrative tasks. &#42;
&#42;&#42;Author&#42;&#42; This role has the ability to create and edit
(unpublished) posts, moderate comments, and upload files. Authors may be
granted this role, and should be if they are repeat contributors. &#42;
&#42;&#42;Contributor&#42;&#42; This is the default role. This role has
the ability to create and edit (unpublished) posts. &#42;
&#42;&#42;Editor&#42;&#42; This role has many abilites, including the
ability ot edit published posts and posts by other authors. Magazine
editors should have this role. &#42; &#42;&#42;Subscriber&#42;&#42; This
role only allows for reading posts. We probably don't need to add anyone
to this role in general.

### Changing a user's role {#_changing_a_users_role}

In the [WordPress dashboard](https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-admin/):

1.  Select &#42;Users&#42; on the left-hand menu

2.  Search or browse for the desired user

3.  Hover over the desired user's row and click \'Edit\'

4.  Change the &#42;Role&#42; dropdown to the desired role

5.  Click the &#42;Update User&#42; button

## Adding an article to a series {#_adding_an_article_to_a_series}

Fedora Magazine uses \'series\' in WordPress to display related articles
in a sidebar. This is often used for Copr articles. However, adding an
article to a series is not straightforward. In the [WordPress
dashboard](https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-admin/):

1.  Select &#42;Posts&#42; on the left-hand menu

2.  Search or browse for the desired posts

3.  Click &#42;Quick Edit&#42;

4.  In the &#42;Post Series&#42; box, type the name of the desired
    series

5.  Click &#42;Update&#42;

If you do not know what the name of the series is, you can look in the
[Post
Series](https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=post_series)
screen. This is located under the &#42;Posts&#42; section of the
left-hand menu.

## Update the current release image/text/link in the Fedora Magazine sidebar {#_update_the_current_release_imagetextlink_in_the_fedora_magazine_sidebar}

The Fedora Magazine WordPress site contains a column on the right side
of the page that includes several \'Widgets\'. One of these contains the
default image (often the background) for the latest version and links to
*fedoraproject.org* and the appropriate release announcement.

The information in this widget must be changed when a new release
occurs. This section describes the process for making the necessary
changes.

### Navigate to the Sidebar Widget {#_navigate_to_the_sidebar_widget}

In the [Fedora Magazine Page](https://fedoramagazine.org/) select:

1.  Select: \'Fedora Magazine\'

    This is the second item from the left in the menu bar on
    <https://fedoramagazine.org>

2.  Now select the following from the pulldown menu:

    Appearances &gt; Customize

3.  Then:

    Widgets &gt; Sidebar

You are now in the \'Customizing Widgets\' window.

Each item in this window is shown vertically as it appears in the right
hand sidebar menu on the Fedora magazine page. This starts with the
\'Search Fedora Magazine (magnifying glass)\' followed by the currently
available Fedora Linux version, subscription option, and so on.

### Add the feature image for the new Fedora Linux version {#_add_the_feature_image_for_the_new_fedora_linux_version}

Select the currently available image and then select \'Add media\'. The
items in the Media library will be shown. Select the feature image for
the new Fedora linux version announcement from the media library.

There will now be two images appearing.

### Edit the HTML text {#_edit_the_html_text}

Select the \'Text\' tab and edit the html that now appears as follows:

1.  Remove the html &lt;img&gt; tag for the previous version

2.  Correct the text in \'&#8230;available now.\' to reflect the new
    version number

3.  Change the \'release announcement\' link to point to the new release
    announcement.

#### Text editing example {#_text_editing_example}

In this example the changes reflect moving from Fedora 35 to 36.

After adding the second image the text might appear as follows:

&#8230;. &lt;img class=\'alignnone wp-image-36451 size-medium\'
src=\'https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f36-final-300x127.jpg\'
alt=\'\' width=\'300\' height=\'127\' /&gt;

&lt;img class=\'alignnone wp-image-36451 size-medium\'
src=\'https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f35-final-300x127.jpg\'
alt=\'\' width=\'300\' height=\'127\' /&gt;

&lt;a href=\'https://fedoraproject.org/\' target=\'\_blank\'
rel=\'noopener\'&gt;Fedora Linux 35 is available now&lt;/a&gt;. Read the
&lt;a href=\'https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-35/\'&gt;
release announcement&lt;/a&gt; for all the details. &#8230;.

The &lt;img&gt; for f35 should be removed. The first &lt;a&gt; anchor
text should be edited to reflect the new version number (36 in this
case). The link to <https://fedoraproject.org> should be left as-is.

The second &lt;a&gt; anchor should be changed to reflect the new Fedora
Magazine announcement URL, for version 36, in this example.

The results should appear similar to the following:

&#8230;. &lt;img class=\'alignnone wp-image-36451 size-medium\'
src=\'https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f36-final-300x127.jpg\'
alt=\'\' width=\'300\' height=\'127\' /&gt;

&lt;a href=\'https://fedoraproject.org/\' target=\'\_blank\'
rel=\'noopener\'&gt;Fedora Linux 36 is available now&lt;/a&gt;. Read the
&lt;a href=\'https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-36/\'&gt;
release announcement&lt;/a&gt; for all the details. &#8230;.

### Commit your changes {#_commit_your_changes}

When done go to the top of the \'Customizing &gt; Widget\' window and
select the \'Publish\' button.

# Zinebot Operations {#_zinebot_operations}

Zinebot is a chatbot designed to help the [editor of the
week](editor-of-the-week.xml) run the [weekly
meetings](editorial-meetings.xml). Importantly, Zinebot is just an aid.
It is not required to run the meetings. Its main purpose is to fetch
information from various sources to save the meeting chair from having
to jump between several browser tabs or applications and copy-paste
information to or from the meeting chatroom. The meetings can still be
run in the traditional way if Zinebot crashes or otherwise fails to
function.

## Installation {#_installation}

See [the Fedora Magazine chatbot
repo](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-chatbot) for installation
instructions. A good way to test Zinebot outside of meeting times is to
create a private room on [the Fedora Project Matrix
homeserver](https://chat.fedoraproject.org) and invite the *zinebot*
user to the room. You will need to assign the room a [local
address](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/13077). You can
then configure Zinebot to join that room.

## Commands {#_commands}

Most of the Zinebot commands operate against [the Fedora Magazine kanban
board](https://pagure.io/fedora-magazine-newsroom/boards/articles).
Notable exceptions include the &#96;show&#96;, &#96;post&#96; and
&#96;eotw&#96; commands.

All of the Zinebot commands must be prefixed with Zinebot's call sign
and a space character. Zinebot's call sign is the unicode diamond
operator (⋄). A convenient way to enter the diamond operator is by using
the [compose
key](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/40.0/&#35;:~:text=Improved%20Settings).
For example, if the compose key is enabled and configured to be the
right-alt key, then tapping the &#42;&#42;Alt&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;&lt;&#42;&#42; and &#42;&#42;&gt;&#42;&#42; keys in sequence
should yield the diamond operator. If so desired, Zinebot's call sign
can be changed by editing its &#96;run&#96; script.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

Add the line:\
::::

\+ &#96;&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;less&gt; &lt;greater&gt; : \'🔹\' U1F539
&#35; SMALL BLUE DIAMOND&#96;\

\+ to your \~/.XCompose file to remap the normal diamond operator
compose sequence to generate a small blue diamond instead. You will need
to restart your X11 or Wayland session for the change to take effect.
Zinebot will accept the small blue diamond character (🔹) as an
alternative call sign. You can still enter the normal diamond operator
by tapping &#42;&#42;Alt&#42;&#42;, &#42;&#42;&gt;&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;&lt;&#42;&#42;.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

The full list of predefined compose keys can be found in the
/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose system file.
::::

:::: tip
::: title
:::

You can customize the single character codes that Zinebot will respond
to by editing the \~/.local/opt/zinebot/commands/hotkeys.pm file.
::::

### 🔹 next topic {#_next_topic}

Included with Zinebot is a &#96;topics.txt&#96; file containing a copy
of [the meeting script](editorial-meetings.xml). The &#96;next
topic&#96; command will iteratively read the blocks of text listed in
the &#96;topics.txt&#96; file and write them out in the chatroom. The
text blocks in the file are separated by blank lines.

Some topics correlate with specific columns on the kanban board. When
appropriate, Zinebot will scan the cards from the corresponding kanban
board column and write them out to the chatroom as a summarized list.
Included in the summary for each card will be an indication of whether
or not the author has signed the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement
(FPCA). The status of the author's FPCA signature is retrieved directly
from the Fedora Account System each time a card is retrieved from the
kanban board.

### 🔹 next col\[umn\] {#_next_column}

Internally, Zinebot keeps track of which kanban column is currently
being viewed. This command advances to the next column on the kanban
board and lists its cards. Normally, this command should not be needed
since the &#96;next topic&#96; command will take care of advancing to
the appropriate column.

### 🔹 next card {#_next_card}

Internally, Zinebot keeps track of which card on the current kanban
column is being viewed. This command advances to the next card in the
column and displays its summary. If you want to view a specific card
rather than iterating through them in order, see the &#96;view&#96;
command below.

As a shorthand for this command, Zinebot will accept a lone unicode
*right-pointing arrow* (→). The call sign should be omitted when using
the shorthand.

### 🔹 skip topic &lt;number\|text&gt; {#_skip_topic_ltnumbertextgt}

This command allows you to skip to a specific topic. For example,
&#96;skip topic agenda&#96; or &#96;skip topic 7&#96;. This command will
reset the internal topic counter such that the result of a subsequent
&#96;next topic&#96; command will be changed. Otherwise, this command
behaves exactly like the &#96;next topic&#96; command.

### 🔹 show proposed {#_show_proposed}

When the *to-edit* column is loaded in the current internal card deck,
this command will read the scheduled publication dates from all the
cards in the deck and list them out along with the card titles and
assigned editors as a proposed editing and publication schedule.

As a shorthand for this command, Zinebot will accept a lone unicode
*because* symbol (∵). The call sign should be omitted when using the
shorthand.

:::: note
::: title
:::

The default compose key sequence for the *because* symbol is
&#42;&#42;&lt;compose-key&gt;&#42;&#42;, &#42;&#42;.&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;:&#42;&#42;.
::::

### 🔹 show agreed {#_show_agreed}

This command generates the same output as the &#96;proposed&#96; command
described above. However, instead of starting with *&#35;proposed*, the
output will begin with *&#35;agreed*.

In the background, this command will also post the agreed-upon
publication schedule to Fedora Magazine's channel on [the Fedora Project
Discourse forum](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org). The success or
failure of each attempted post is indicated by a respective 🔹 or 🔸 at
the end of each scheduled card. Only articles that are scheduled for the
upcoming week should post successfully. Anything that is scheduled for
an earlier or later date should automatically fail to post.

As a shorthand for this command, Zinebot will accept a lone unicode
*therefore* symbol (∴). The call sign should be omitted when using the
shorthand.

:::: note
::: title
:::

The default compose key sequence for the *therefore* symbol is
&#42;&#42;&lt;compose-key&gt;&#42;&#42;, &#42;&#42;:&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;.&#42;&#42;.
::::

### 🔹 show testdays {#_show_testdays}

This command scans [the Fedora Project QA
calendar](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/QA) for test day events and
displays them in the chatroom. The scan is limited to a three-week
period that begins on Sunday of the current week. Test day events are
identified as those whose *meeting location* is set to
*fedora-test-day&#42;*.

### 🔹 show schedule {#_show_schedule}

This command scans [the Fedora Project
schedule](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule) for scheduled Fedora
Magazine publications such as beta and final release announcements. The
results are then listed in the chatroom.

### 🔹 list \[column\] {#_list_column}

This command generates a summarized list of kanban cards from either the
current kanban column or, if specified, the requested kanban column. The
&#96;next topic&#96;, &#96;skip topic&#96; and &#96;next column&#96;
commands call this command automatically. When a specific column is
requested, all subsequent Zinebot commands will consider it the
*current* column.

Internally, the &#96;next card&#96; and &#96;view&#96; Zinebot commands
operate against a cache of cards retrieved from the current kanban
column rather than fetching them from Pagure each time. This command
repopulates the internal cache whenever it is called. The current card
is also reset to the first card in the list. If you modify any of the
cards that are cached, you may need to rerun this command to update the
internal cache.

### 🔹 view \[number\] {#_view_number}

This command does exactly the same thing as the &#96;next card&#96;
command. However, unlike the latter, it allows you to specify a specific
card number to display. The requested card must be loaded in the current
card cache from a prior run of the &#96;list&#96; command. When a
specific card is requested, the current card index for the next run of
the &#96;next card&#96; command is not advanced.

### 🔹 card &lt;number&gt; &lt;property&gt; \[&lt;property&gt; &#8230;\] {#_card_ltnumbergt_ltpropertygt_ltpropertygt_8230}

This is a low-level command that allows you to access individual card
properties. When provided a card number, this command operates directly
against Pagure. This command can access cards that are not in the
current column. The following card properties are accessible through
this command.

     🞄 id
     🞄 title
     🞄 full_url
     🞄 content
     🞄 comments[:N]
     🞄 \&lt;any-custom-field-name\&gt;

By default, the last three comments are retrieved from the card when the
&#96;comments&#96; property is requested. The number of comments to
retrieve can be specified by appending &#42;&#42;:N&#42;&#42; to the
property name where &#42;&#42;N&#42;&#42; is a positive integer. All
card comments can be requested by appending &#42;&#42;:0&#42;&#42; to
the property name.

### 🔹 move &lt;number&gt; &lt;column&gt; \[row\] {#_move_ltnumbergt_ltcolumngt_row}

This command moves the specified card to the specified kanban column.
Optionally, the row offset at which the card should be placed in the
target column can be specified. By default, cards are moved to the top
of the target column (row 1).

As a shorthand, you can use the unicode characters ← or → in place of
the column name to signify the previous or next column respectively.

:::: note
::: title
:::

The default compose key sequence for the *leftwards arrow* symbol is
&#42;&#42;&lt;compose-key&gt;&#42;&#42;, &#42;&#42;&lt;&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;.
::::

:::: note
::: title
:::

The default compose key sequence for the *rightwards arrow* symbol is
&#42;&#42;&lt;compose-key&gt;&#42;&#42;, &#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;,
&#42;&#42;&gt;&#42;&#42;.
::::

### 🔹 ping &lt;number&gt; &lt;comment&gt; {#_ping_ltnumbergt_ltcommentgt}

This command adds a one-line comment to the specified card. Pagure
should send an email notification to the card's assignee containing the
comment. The comment does not need to be quoted. Everything after the
card number is considered part of the comment.

### 🔹 post &lt;title&gt; \[date \[time\]\] {#_post_lttitlegt_date_time}

This command posts an event to the Fedora Magazine calendar on Fedora's
Discourse forum. If the date is not specified, it defaults to one week
from the current day. If the time is not specified, it defaults to the
beginning of the current hour. Dates must be specified as YYYY-MM-DD.
Times must be specified as HH:MM:SS. Times are in Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC). The title does not need to be quoted. Anything that does not
match a date or time pattern is considered part of the event title.

This command is called automatically by the &#96;show agreed&#96;
command to add the agreed-upon articles to the publication calendar.

### 🔹 eotw &lt;username&gt; {#_eotw_ltusernamegt}

This command posts the editor of the week line. Just for fun,
&#96;king&#96; and &#96;queen&#96; are aliases for this command. They
may be easier to remember.
