= Mindshare Teams in Fedora

Mindshare Teams are focused on helping our community grow both the number of users and contributors.
The teams in Mindshare are each focused on a different aspect of this goal.
The xref:mindshare.adoc[Mindshare Committee] fosters communication amongst the Mindshare teams and helps facilitate Council strategy.

= Advocate Program

== What Is A Fedora Advocate?

Advocates are passionate contributors who want to participate in community events, represent Fedora and help grow the user and contributor community.
Advocates are people who love spreading knowledge about their area of interest in Fedora.
Many advocates also organize release parties where they share information about What's new in Fedora.
Advocates also help new contributors join and hack on any of the subprojects at meetups and Fedora Activity Days (FADs).
Advocates come from all parts of the project and represent contributors from all areas, technical and non-technical.

== What Purpose Do They Solve?

Organize Fedora participation at events

\&#42; Foster Fedora contributors and encourage contribution and usage
\&#42; Promote Fedora and cross-community interaction
\&#42; Hold calendar events like release parties
\&#42; Promote Fedora technology at local user groups with talks etc.

== What Makes A Great Fedora Advocate?

Fedora Advocates tend to be people who are:

\&#42; already contributors and users of Fedora.
+
Advocates are adding to their current contribution, not starting out with Fedora.
This allows you to focus on community building in your area of expertise and interest.
If you’re brand new to the project, becoming an Advocate is most likely not a good first step.
Start with contribution in other areas first.

\&#42; friendly and approachable.
+
They like working with and talking to others, especially one-on-one in person or electronically.
They realize that people are the key element of successful Open Source projects.
Everything that we do -- events, budgets, swag, blogging -- it's all done to make personal connections with folks who either want to use or contribute to Fedora.

\&#42; wanting to lead a regional or locally focused community or start one.
+
You should be eager and happy to work with Fedora Ambassadors to learn more about the project which you may not have contributed to before.

\&#42; the fabric of the community outreach effort.
+
You are expected to collaborate and work with people in your local area, including colleges, universities, professional groups or meetups, and other places where like-minded individuals tend to congregate.
You are the face of Fedora in your area.

== Joining

Joining the Advocates is super-easy.
\&#42;\&#42;Just hold an event.\&#42;\&#42;
Really, that’s it.
Details on how to do that and advice for getting started are below.

You should also consider joining these two mailing lists:

\&#42; The link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/ambassadors@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Ambassadors Mailing list].
+
This list is where the ambassador and advocate groups talk and plan events.
Events are announced, planned and improved on this list.
This list helps you know what is going on that you might want to help with and shares ideas you might want to copy and modify for your area.
Talking to a local Ambassador directly although a nice approach puts you in contact with one person who can be busy.
By talking to the whole community you increase your chance of help and collaboration.

\&#42; The link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/mindshare-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Mindshare-Announce list].
+
This low volume list will help you know what is going on in Fedora that relates to marketing and community growth.
The Mindshare committee, which approves event requests also posts their meeting minutes here.

[NOTE]
Once you’ve done your first event, we’ll add you to the list of advocates by putting you into the advocate's FAS group, and you will be awarded with the fabulous link:https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/fedora-advocate[Fedora Advocate Badge].

== Getting Started

Make your first projects small ones that are well-defined.
Many advocates start out by:

\&#42; holding a Fedora Calendar Event such as a Release Party.
+
This will give you the chance to learn the process of hosting events and communicating with the Ambassadors and Mindshare.

\&#42; joining an existing event and helping out.
+
This is easy to do if your monitoring the mailing list.

\&#42; teaming up with a Fedora Ambassador.
+
It's great to have Ambassadors by your side, they can help you plan and execute your event.
They also have lots of experience with what works and what doesn’t and they may be familiar with different parts of the project than you are.

In all cases, think about what your community is interested in and focused on.
Fedora has multiple editions and objectives and they are all great technologies and great stories to tell.
Pick the one that makes the most sense to your and your community.
For some people, focussing on the work of a specific subproject makes the most sense.
If your community is focused on a specific language stack, etc., talk about that.

== Holding An Event

When you’re ready to hold an event, you need to do a few simple things:

. Open a ticket in the link:https://pagure.io/mindshare/issues[Mindshare Issue Tracker] and let people know about your event.
If your event needs financial or swag support (see below) this is a crucial (and mandatory) first step.

. Send an email to the ambassadors mailing list and let the world know what you’re planning.
Ambassadors and others may have suggestions or advice that can improve your event.
This also lets you find others who may want to help you with your event.

. Hold your event.
\&#42;\&#42;Be awesome!\&#42;\&#42;

. Write an event report.
An event report lets the community know what happened and how it went.
Ideally your report will be shared on the Fedora Community Blog, but posting it on your own blog and the Fedora Planet is fine too.
If your event requires financial or swag support (see below), this is mandatory.
Update your event ticket with the link of the event report.

. 'Lather. Rinse. Repeat.' as your shampoo bottle says.
Do it again and again and keep the momentum going.



== Getting Swag or Financial Support

The goal of an event is the spread knowledge and attract users and contributors to Fedora.
We realize that sometimes you need swag (such as stickers, buttons and pins) or money to help make this possible.
The Advocate role is designed with the idea of easy to accomplish events in mind.
Our Fedora Ambassadors (which you are free to join) also do larger more involved events.

Therefore, Advocates are limited in what they can request.
When you are planning for an event you should think about using Fedora Stickers (we have lots of designs and will typically send 50 stickers) and a budget of $100 or less.
If you need more, we encourage you to team up with a Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a larger budget.
We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget that make the most sense for you, your area, and the event, however we tend to restrict the money to no more than $25 being spent on travel and none being used to produced swag.
The balance is typically spent on food, meeting space, etc.

To request support do this:

. Make sure the ticket you opened with Mindshare above contains your budget request and is detailed as to how you want to use it.
There is a template in the link:https://pagure.io/mindshare/new_issue[Mindshare Repository] to help you.
You need to select it from the \&#96;Type\&#96; drop down.
The template is named \&#42;\&#42;advocate\&#42;\&#42;.
Please use it.

. Wait for Mindshare to make a decision.
Our goal is to decide on events within one calendar week.
However, you should have as much lead time as possible as there may be questions from the committee or unforeseeable delays.
Shipping also takes time, so allow a lot of it, especially if the import process in your country is long.
+
Mindshare will typically respond with:
+
\&#42; Approved: GO FOR IT! Your event is approved.
\&#42;\&#42;We want you to be successful.\&#42;\&#42;
+
\&#42; Questions/Suggestions: We are a bit confused or have some questions and ideas.
We may also suggest different ways to use your budget or that you work with an Ambassador.
In some cases we will want to make sure you’re well versed in the technology you want to represent.
Respond to these concerns to get a final decision.
+
\&#42; Declined: There are various reasons why we can’t support your event.
We hope to never have to decline an event and instead that we can work with you to make it a success.

. If you've asked for swag, please submit a \&#42;\&#42;swag-shipment\&#42;\&#42; request in the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-budget/issues[Fedora Budget Pagure] using the provided template.
Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is generally not stored in your country.
Most of the delay is to allow time for customs processing in your country, not shipping.

. Do It! Hold the event and save your receipts.

. Write your report.
Link your report to your ticket.

. Submit a reimbursement request to the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-budget/issues[Fedora Budget Pagure] using the provided template.
Reimbursements are typically paid within 2 weeks.

== Writing Your Event Report

The work of Advocates is often featured in the Mindshare newsletters and hence the event report holds a significant amount of importance.
The report is a general summary of an event which gives the project an idea of what's going on and reports on successes as well as lessons learned.

Reporting can be done in many ways.
Here's are a couple of commonly used methods for sharing the event report with the community:

\&#42; \&#42;Community Blog\&#42; (a.k.a. \&#42;CommBlog\&#42;): You can https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/wp-login.php[sign into the Community Blog WordPress site] using your FAS account credentials.
Once inside, you can create a new post where you can draft your experience.
After you are done, follow the steps in the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/writing-community-blog-article/[guide on publishing articles on the CommBlog].
Here's an example of a https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-27-release-party-at-taipei/[Fedora 27 release party blog post].

\&#42; \&#42;Your own Blog\&#42; : If you have been maintaining your own blog, you can post it there as well.
To extend the reach of audience, Advocates may syndicate their blog to Fedora Planet.
For more information https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Planet?rd=Planet_HowTo[check out this 'how to'.]

Comment on your issue in the https://pagure.io/mindshare/issues[mindshare repo with a link to your event report.]


= Contributor Recruitment

Part of keeping Fedora a vibrant, healthy community is bringing new contributors on board.
One way we can do this is to have our presence at events focus on recruiting contributors.
Open source events are a great way to reach people who are interested in joining a project.

The idea behind this plan is not to replace the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-join-is-trying-a-new-people-focused-workflow-for-newcomers/[people-focused workflow] that the Fedora Join SIG uses.
What we want is to create a 'funnel' of potential contributors that the Join SIG can help bring into the Fedora community.

In order to give people a focused area, we highlight a few teams that are a link:current_focus[current area of focus].

== Events

The primary goal of Fedora's presence at conferences and other large events should be contributor recruitment.
This does not mean that we can't do general messaging, but that will not be the focus or how success is measured.
We should, of course, continue to speak to existing users about the shiny new technical features in the latest release.

The 'How to organize an event' page will soon be updated with specific guidance.

== Online campaigns

We encourage teams that are looking for new contributors to submit Fedora Magazine articles describing their current work, and areas they need help with.
As an example, see Adam Šamalík's https://fedoramagazine.org/contribute-to-fedora-magazine-2/[Contribute to Fedora Magazine article].
In addition we can use social media channels to promote these articles.
Teams can work with the https://pagure.io/design[Fedora Design team] to create images that can be used to promote recruitment.


\&#42; Committee Procedures
= Creating and Ordering Swag

To make the production and creating of swag more efficient, the Mindshare Committee has empowered the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fcaic/[Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator (FCAIC)] to produce and create swag as needed to keep our inventory full.
Swag items and use will be approved by Mindshare, in general, and then the FCAIC/others will fulfill needs for the various events based on their best judgement in concert with the event owner/coordinator.
The FCAIC will consult with Mindshare if there are questions.

Anyone can open a Mindshare ticket or contact the FCAIC to suggest swag items.
Event owners/coordinators can request specific swag when proposing their events.
No promises are made that specific swag items will be produced.

The goal of centralized swag production is to ensure high quality and reduced costs (through larger print runs).
We tend to use swag that is project themed and focused except for large events or special needs.

As an example, this process looks like this for the Fedora Booklets in link:https://pagure.io/mindshare/issue/105[Mindshare Ticket \&#35;105].

. Mindshare makes a decision about the use of the booklets in general and about Fedora providing them
. FCAIC/others arrange to have them printed and in-stock or on-demand for use
. Event Owners suggest when they will be useful at their events
. AMAZING EVENTS!

= Adding New Members

The following typically need to be done to add a new member to the committee:

\&#42; Update the link:https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/mindshare[Mindshare FAS Group]
\&#42; Update the link:https://pagure.io/group/fedora-mindshare[Mindshare Pagure Group]
\&#42; Update the link:https://pagure.io/mindshare/tree/master[Mindshare Docs Page] that lists the members
\&#42; Update the meeting script above
\&#42; Add the person to the calendar invite


= Fedora Mentored Project Representative

Purpose:
--------

Fedora has been participating in fedora has been a participant of  GSoC, GSoD and Outreachy. All the three are program which runs throughout the year and need attention of a dedicated person.

Can I join in as a representative?
----------------------------------

Mindshare sees value in having \&#42;selected\&#42; seat assigned to a someone who will be taking care of the following responsibilities.

\&#42; Making sure GSoC, GSoD and Outreachy applications are submitted on time.
\&#42; Coordinating with GSoC, GSoD and Outreachy admins for common work like intern's intro interviews, weekly/biweekly/monthly reports on their work, community involvement, etc.
\&#42; Identify and segregate projects suggested on mentored project issues for GSoC/Outreachy/GSoD.
\&#42; Explore similar programs that can fit in mentored projects and see if it's feasible (like rails girls).
\&#42; Market and spread news of summer coding programs with other SIG members to attract more participation.
\&#42; Be one point of contact for communication around relevant topics.
\&#42; Be involved in mindshare committee with ticket approvals, decision making, and other things that mindshare seat is expected to do.
\&#42; Attend weekly meetings (if possible).
\&#42; Retain students and effectively show the students the pathway to be long term Fedora contributor.

Support the current representative
----------------------------------

This is an \&#42;Selected\&#42; seat which means that people who are interested in working as mentored project rep can actually help the current represenative to learn 'how to do things right'


= Mindshare Committee Quarterly Report Doc

== Overview

The Mindshare Committee represents the outreach teams in Fedora and provides an umbrella for other non-coding teams. Mindshare has established a Quarterly Report to help round up announcements, information, and updates from these teams. This page holds documentation on our process to gather information, format, and publish the report.

== Which teams are part of the report?

All teams on the Mindshare 'side' of the Fedora ecosystem are welcome to participate. Teams which have active representatives on the committee are strongly suggested to contribute to the report.

Current list of teams and how to contact them for info:

\&#42; Ambassadors (Community Outreach Revamp Team/FCAIC)
\&#42; CommOps (Rep)
\&#42; Council (Rep)
\&#42; Design (Rep)
\&#42; Diversity, Equity, \&amp; Inclusion (Discourse)
\&#42; Docs (Rep)
\&#42; Globalization (https://pagure.io/i18n/issues)
\&#42; Join SIG (join@lists.fedoraproject.org)
\&#42; Magazine (Discourse)
\&#42; Marketing (Discourse)
\&#42; Mentored Projects (Rep)
\&#42; Mindshare (This is us!)
\&#42; Podcast (IRC/Element)
\&#42; Translations (trans@lists.fedoraproject.org)
\&#42; Websites \&amp; Apps (Discourse)

== What's the process?

A ticket is opened on the Mindshare pagure to track progress for each report (i.e. 'Q1 Mindshare Report - January, February, March 2022') and is triaged with the tag 'quarterly-report'. The owner of the ticket is the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator(FCAIC).

The report is written up and edited in a HackMD file. The Mindshare Committee has team space on HackMD to store these and other Mindshare related working documents.

A template has been created in HackMD for ease of reproducibility. To access the template you need to be a part of the Mindshare team space on HackMD. How to find the template:

\&#42; Click the '\&#8230;' drop down menu
\&#42; Click '+ Insert from template'
\&#42; Choose 'Mindshare Quarterly Report'
\&#42; Click 'Use this template'.

Once the ticket and template have been set up, additions are welcome to be made through the quarter.

The last month of the quarter, two Mindshare Committee meetings will be used in some capacity to gather information from the Representatives and other members of Mindshare. Any teams that are not represented on Mindshare should be contacted with at least two weeks notice to provide any additions.

Once all the information from the various teams has been gathered, the FCAIC does any final edits and moves the report into the CommBlog wordpress. This should be done the last week of the quarter. Make sure to follow the 'Writing a Community Blog post' process outlined on the CommBlog. Request that the CommBlog editors publish the post within a week or two of the last quarter end.

After the report is published to the CommBlog, a link should be added to the corresponding ticket. That ticket can then be closed as complete and a new ticket for the upcoming quarter should be opened immediately. The cycle starts again!



= Fedora Council Mindshare representative

As a major steering committee under the Fedora Council, Mindshare is responsible for selecting a representative that covers the community aspects of the Fedora Project.
This person is responsible for representing Mindshare as a collective and not as a single voice.
They will be required to work with all of the various groups that collaborate with Mindshare and act as a liaison between these groups and the Council.
The role will require a fair amount of time investment and good communication skills.

== Responsibilities

The following responsibilities and duties are delegated to the Mindshare representative.

To Fedora Council:

\&#42; Participate in two to three Council hackfests a year (If these events happen).

\&#42; Participate in two to three Council meetings a month as representative of the Mindshare committee (If these events happen).

\&#42; Identify synergies and collaboration opportunities with Fedora Council responsibilities, Mindshare objectives, and the Fedora Community.

\&#42; Any other normal functions of a Fedora Council member

To the Mindshare Committee:

\&#42; Participate in two to three Mindshare meetings a month.

\&#42; Share periodic updates and insight on Council tasks and priorities back to the team.

\&#42; Listen to the needs, concerns, and hopes of the Fedora Community and relay them to the Mindshare Committee.

== Duration of Service

The representative will serve in this role for two release cycles.
They may also step down before that time or the Council or Mindshare may wish to replace them.
Careful consideration of time commitments should be taken when making the selection, and the Council, Mindshare, and the representative should evaluate their effectiveness as a group on a fairly regular basis.
In the event that the representative to Mindshare needs to step down, they should make the Committee aware and the process to choose a new rep will begin.
In the event that the Mindshare Committee or the Council wish to make a change in representative, a thorough explanation of why will be required, and each situation will be handled on a case by case basis.
In the event that the Council wants to change the rep, Mindshare Committee will review and make a final decision, and vice versa.

== Nomination

This section explains how the representative is nominated and confirmed.
The selection process documented below is initiated when a rotation of representatives is motioned by the existing representative, the Mindshare committee, or the Fedora Council.

There will be a two-week nomination period for potential representatives.
Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated by other members of the Mindshare Committee with their consent.
Nominees are required to be members of the Mindshare Committee and should have a basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects, and have sufficient time to perform the responsibilities required.

In the event that there are no nominees, the Mindshare committee will work with the Council to broaden the search message and request more time.
Should no nominees be found after that, the role will rotate among existing Mindshare members until the next representative is identified.

== Selection

After the nomination period expires, Mindshare will discuss candidates in a public meeting.
A meeting discussion provides an opportunity for the team to weigh in and share another context.
In the unlikely event that more than two nominees are interested in the representative role, we will allow for an additional week to discuss and come to a resolution as a Committee.

The selected person and the Council will be notified, and the person will start serving in that role as soon as possible.

\&#42; Fedora Events



= In-person event guidance related to COVID-19
:page-aliases: ROOT:covid19-guidance.adoc

[NOTE]
====
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
====

This page holds COVID-19 related guidance for in person events.
This applies to Fedorans who are receiving Fedora funding related to events.
By receiving funds related to in person events, you are agreeing to the Terms posted at the bottom of this page.
The state of the virus is ever-changing, so take this information as a general guideline and not hard fact.
Feel free to direct any questions to the {team_name}.
Contact the {team_name} through chat in link:{team_synch_communication}[\&#35;mindshare:fedoraproject.org] or by link:{team_issue_tracker}[opening a ticket] on the Mindshare repo.

To learn more about requesting funds for Fedora related events, take a look at the xref:mindshare-committee::index.adoc[{team_name} docs].


== What you need to know

=== What is an event?

For the purpose of this page, an event is any internal (Fedora contributors), external (collaborations, partners, neighbor communities), or a mix of both internal/external gathering of people that takes place in person.
This is for all Fedora related events regardless of size, location/region, audience (internal, external), or type (Fedora hosted events or third party events).

=== How will Mindshare evaluate what events to fund?

This is the part that is ever-changing.
As we have witnessed, COVID-19 seems to spread, then we suppress it some, and then evolves and spreads again.
Hopefully we will soon see developments that can neutralize COVID-19, or significantly decrease the severity.
Until that time, we have to remain flexible.

This means evaluating event funding requests on a case-by-case basis.
The Fedora Project must comply with all applicable laws and regulations for events that we sponsor and/or fund.

In order for the {team_name} to make a decision about event related funding the following information will be required along with usual info.
Please submit this information when link:{team_issue_tracker}[opening an event related ticket] on the {team_name} repo.
See below for details:

. Event website
. Specific COVID-19 safety measures that the Event will be implementing
. Approximate number of attendees
. Country where event is taking place
. Will your travel to/from the event bring you across a Country border?
. Local official COVID-19 guidance

=== Safety requirements

Every event is encouraged to follow the highest possible safety standards for the protection of all participants.
For example:

\&#42; Adherence to third party or venue safety measures that are required.
\&#42; Understanding of and adherence to government requirements.
\&#42; Vaccination requirements.
\&#42; Communication of link:\&#35;terms[Terms] to participants of Fedora organized events

Every individual should be aware of and are encouraged to follow the highest possible safety standards for the protection of all participants.
For example:

\&#42; Adherence to requirements related to traveling and any costs associated (i.e. testing, isolation periods, documentation, etc.).
\&#42; If you become sick with COVID-19 near the time of the funded event, you must test negative before traveling to or participating in any Fedora related events.


[[terms]]
== Terms

By receiving funding related to in-person events, you agree to the following:

. While onsite, you agree to comply with all laws and rules with regard to public health including social distancing protocols and face mask requirements.
. You acknowledge the health risks associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, and the risk of exposure or infection by COVID-19.
. Neither Fedora, the event venue, the event organizer, or any of their respective parents, affiliates, sponsors, shareholders, employees, agents, officers, directors, successors, or assignees will be liable for any injury or illness, however caused, arising from, or in any way relate to COVID-19 in connection with the event.
. You assume any and all risk, whatsoever, related to any Fedora or Fedora-related event, and release and discharge Fedora, their sponsors, and their agents from any liability to the fullest extent allowed by the law.





= What is a Release Party?
:page-aliases: ROOT:release-parties.adoc

Release Parties are an informal gathering of community members hosted by Fedora to celebrate a new release.
Release parties are a great way to help spread Fedora in your local area and provide an opportunity for Fedora users in your area to come together as a community.

Release parties can be casual events with a few people meeting in a coffee shop or larger events with numerous people in attendance, planned activities, and speakers.


[[what-to-do]]
== What to do at Release Parties?

There are many things you can do at a Release Party.
A typical release party will have the following:

. \&#42;Talks/Presentations\&#42;:
Typically talks at release parties are ones that introduce features in the new release of Fedora.
If you're not sure what are the most interesting and important check the link:{FWIKI}/Fedora_29_talking_points[Talking points].
. \&#42;Question and Answer session\&#42;:
Host a session where people can come and ask questions about Fedora.
This can be a great way to help answer people's questions and learn what common questions are in the community.
It is also an opportunity to help people with installs and upgrades.
It is OK if you are not an expert.
Make this an “audience participation” event and get everyone to help everyone, just like in the rest of Fedora.
This is also a great time to show off the various ways to get help online.
. \&#42;Live USB Creation Station\&#42;:
Have a machine with you that you can create Live USB images for people on the USB keys they provide.
This can be a great way to send someone home with a Live Fedora image they can work with if they are hesitant to commit to an actual Fedora install.

These are just ideas.
You are not required to do any or all of them.
Focus your party on your audience.
For example, if you are hosting a release party at work, have talks focused on the way you use Linux and how that relates to Fedora.


[[hosting]]
== Hosting Release Parties

_It is simple to host a Release Party_.

When you’re ready, you need to do a few simple things:

. Post to the link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#35;mindshare tag on Fedora Discussion] and let the world know what you are planning.
Ambassadors and others may have suggestions or advice that can improve your event.
This also lets you find others who may want to help you with your event.
. Open a ticket in the link:{team_issue_tracker}[Mindshare issue tracker] and let people know about your event.
If your event needs financial or swag support (see below), this is a mandatory step.
Please use the _Release Party_ template.
. Once your party is approved, do the following:
.. Add it to the https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/Events/[Events Fedocal], so others can find it.
.. Request a QR code to award the Release Party Attendee badge.
You can do it by opening an issue at link:{team_issue_tracker}[Mindshare issue tracker].
.. Put in a swag request ticket in the Event Requests repo (see below).
.. Finalize your plans and hold your party.
. After your party, write an event report.
An event report lets the community know what happened and how it went.
Ideally your report will be shared on the Fedora Community Blog, but posting it on your own blog and the Fedora Planet is fine too.
If your event requires financial or swag support (see below), this is mandatory.
These reports should help us understand what happened and how the party went.
Ideas for what went well and what could be improved are welcome.
. If you have financial assistance approved, file a reimbursement ticket in the link:https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests[Event Requests repository].


[[assistance-swag]]
== Financial Assistance and Swag

Release Parties and should be planned at least 30-40 days in advance.
In our experience, events planned with less lead time are generally less successful.
If you request swag, plan two weeks for shipping.

Follow the Getting Financial Assistance and Swag section xref:ROOT:advocate.adoc\&#35;_getting_swag_or_financial_support[here].

= Swag-Only Requests
:page-aliases: ROOT:swag-only-requests.adoc

If you only need swag to help you hold an event, we have a fast-track policy to help you out.
Anyone can request swag for an event, you don't have to be an Ambassador.
If you are new to Fedora events, checkout our xref:ROOT:advocate.adoc[Advocate Program].

. Please open a Mindshare ticket in the link:{team_issue_tracker}[Mindshare Repository].
You need to select the \&#42;\&#42;swag-only\&#42;\&#42; template from the \&#96;Type\&#96; drop down.
Please complete the fields required.

. Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

. Voting usually starts quickly.

. Open a \&#42;\&#42;swag-shipment\&#42;\&#42; request in the link:https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests[Event Requests repo] using the provided template.
Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is generally not stored in your country.
Most of the delay is to allow time for customs processing in your country, not shipping.

. Hold your event!

. Write your event report
+
Fedora Events are often featured in the Mindshare newsletters and hence the event report holds a significant amount of importance.
The report is a general summary of an event which gives the project an idea of what's going on and reports on successes as well as lessons learned.
+
Reporting can be done in many ways.
Here's are a couple of commonly used methods for sharing the event report with the community:
+
\&#42; \&#42;Community Blog\&#42; (a.k.a. \&#42;CommBlog\&#42;):

= Holding or Attending a Small Event
:page-aliases: ROOT:small-events.adoc

Anyone can hold or attend a small Fedora-related event, you don't have to be an Ambassador.
A small event is one where the budget is under $150.
The process is exactly the same as for our xref:ROOT:advocate.adoc[Advocate Program].
It is summarized below:

. Please open a Mindshare ticket in the link:{team_issue_tracker}[Mindshare Repository].
You should use the \&#42;\&#42;advocate\&#42;\&#42; template from the \&#96;Type\&#96; drop down.
Please complete the fields required.
+
When you are planning for an event you should think about using Fedora stickers and similar swag along with a budget of $150 or less.
If you need more budget, we encourage you to team up with a Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a larger budget.
We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget that make the most sense for you, your area, and the event.

. Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

. Voting usually starts very quickly.
The ticket needs to get 2 +1s and no -1s in three days.

+
When preparing your ticket, keep these things in mind:
+
\&#42; Be clear in what you hope to accomplish and why the event is good for Fedora.
\&#42; Help the {team_name} understand how you are qualified to help make this a success.
You may want to talk about your experience, or contribution history.
\&#42; Think about how you will use the budget and what kind of swag support, if any, will help you be successful.
We like to see the budget spent directly on the event or attendance and not on swag production.
If you need more budget, we encourage you to team up with a Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a larger budget.
We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget that make the most sense for you, your area, and the event.

. Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

. Voting usually starts very quickly.
The ticket needs to get 3 +1s and no -1s in eleven days.
When this happens, a committee member will update the ticket with an approved message.
If all committee members vote sooner, the ticket can be approved sooner.
The goal of the eleven day period is to ensure that we have at least one meeting during the discussion period (allowing for holidays, etc.).

. Open a \&#42;\&#42;swag-shipment\&#42;\&#42; request if you need swag for this event.

.Policies \&amp; Processes



= Late Event Report Policy
:page-aliases: ROOT:event-report-policy.adoc

This page documents the Event Report Policy for any event funded by the Fedora Project.
Every funded event requires an event report.
This page documents expected outcomes and consequences when an event organizer does not write an event report.


[[days-30]]
== After 30 days

Event reports more than 30 days (about a month) late result in the following:

. The contributor is not reimbursed for event expenses until the report is complete.
. The contributor is unable to solely sponsor additional events or request swag.


[[days-90]]
== After 90 days

Event reports more than 90 days (about 3 months) late result in the following:

. All 30-day consequences listed previously.
. The contributor is not allowed to take a leadership position in organizing events until they provide the missing event report and xref:reestablish-activity[re-establish their activity].
. The contributor is ineligible for advance funding for travel funding/requests until this is resolved.


[[days-120]]
== After 120 days

After 120 days, the event report is no longer required as it probably has limited value.
Event reports more than 120 days (about four months) late result in the following:

. All 90-day consequences listed previously.
. The contributor is not allowed to take a leadership position in organizing events until they xref:reestablish-activity[re-establish their activity].
. The contributor is ineligible for any advance funding for travel funding/requests for one of the following, whichever is longer:
.. 14 months from the date of the original event, \&#42;OR\&#42;
.. 6 months from the date they have re-established their activity in the project.
. The contributor is removed from the roster of active xref:ROOT:advocate.adoc[Advocates], if applicable.
. They are not allowed to officially represent the Fedora Project until they xref:reestablish-activity[re-establish their activity] in the project.


[[reestablish-activity]]
== Re-establishing project activity

Re-establishing activity is a conversation, not an algorithm.
It is generally met by being a helper at other people's events or otherwise showing the {team_name} they are actively involved in Fedora SIGs or other online events.
The {team_name} strongly considers a person's history and unique circumstances.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This document outlines the current process for Fedora Project contributors not employed by Red Hat to request and receive reimbursement from Red Hat for pre-approved, project-related expenses.
These requests are known as \&#42;Fedora Reimbursement Requests (FRR)\&#42;.
Please follow the steps detailed here, as they reflect current Red Hat policies and procedures.

Fedora Reimbursement Requests (FRRs) typically cover the following types of pre-approved expenses:

\&#42; \&#42;Travel\&#42;:
Airfare, train, or bus tickets.
\&#42; \&#42;Accommodation\&#42;:
Hotel or hostel stays.
Home-sharing services such as Airbnb are _NOT_ allowed.
\&#42; \&#42;Other Specific Expenses\&#42;:
Event registration fees.
Visa application fees may be covered in extraordinary circumstances and with specific pre-approval.

Meals and local transport (e.g., metro, bus, taxi) are \&#42;NOT\&#42; eligible for reimbursement through this program.
====


[[prerequisites]]
== Before You Begin: Essential Prerequisites

Before starting the Fedora Reimbursement Request (FRR) process, please ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

\&#42; \&#42;Fedora Account System (FAS) account\&#42;:
You must have an active FAS account.
Experienced Fedora contributors typically already have this.
\&#42; \&#42;USD Reimbursement\&#42;:
All reimbursements Red Hat issues are in \&#42;\&#42;US Dollars (USD)\&#42;\&#42; only, regardless of the currency in which you incurred expenses.
\&#42; \&#42;Tax Responsibility\&#42;:
You are personally responsible for any tax obligations in your country of residence that may arise from receiving this reimbursement.
Red Hat does not provide tax advice or handle individual tax liabilities.


[[preapproval]]
== Stage 1: Obtaining Pre-Approval for Your Expenses

This first stage must be completed \&#42;before\&#42; you incur any expenses that you expect Red Hat to reimburse.

[[community-approval]]
=== Step 1.1: Secure Fedora Community Funding Approval

Before Red Hat can consider an FRR, your activity and associated funding must be approved by an appropriate Fedora Project governance body.
For event-related expenses, this is typically the xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:index.adoc[Fedora Mindshare Committee].

. Follow the current procedures outlined by the Fedora Mindshare Committee below to request sponsorship.
These processes may be under review or restructuring, but they represent the publicly-known guidelines:
\&#42;\&#42; xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/large.adoc[Large Event Requests]
\&#42;\&#42; xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/medium.adoc[Medium Event Requests]
\&#42;\&#42; xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/small.adoc[Small Event Requests]
\&#42;\&#42; xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/release-parties.adoc[Release Party Funding]
\&#42;\&#42; xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/swag-only.adoc[Swag-Only Requests]
. Once approved, you will use the public URL from the Mindshare Committee GitLab issue that documents this community approval and the budgeted amount.

\&#42;Keep this URL handy; you will need it later for your FRR.\&#42;

[[bear]]
=== Step 1.2: Obtain Red Hat BEAR Pre-Approval (If Sponsoring Travel or Accommodation)

If your FRR includes funding for \&#42;travel\&#42; (such as flights, train, or bus tickets) or \&#42;accommodation\&#42; (like hotel stays), you _must_ also obtain pre-approval from Red Hat's internal Business Entertainment and Amenities Review (BEAR) team.

BEAR pre-approval is \&#42;not\&#42; required if your sponsorship only covers an event registration fee and does not include any Fedora-funded travel or accommodation.

\&#42;To obtain BEAR pre-approval\&#42;:

. You need to fill out the form in the {url-ospo-bear}[Red Hat OSPO BEAR GitLab repository].
This form asks for the following:
\&#42; Your full, legal name; FAS username; preferred email.
\&#42; Details about your employer (name, type such as government, commercial, self-employed).
\&#42; Requested travel dates.
\&#42; Estimates for your travel and accommodation costs in \&#42;US Dollars (USD)\&#42;.
For airfare or rail, provide the total estimated cost.
\&#42; Event details, including any conference fees if applicable.
\&#42; Answers to compliance-related questions.
. Submit this form by creating a new \&#42;confidential\&#42; issue on the repository linked previously.
Ensure you check the box to make the issue confidential.
. The Fedora Community Architect (FCA) will be notified of your request and will facilitate the internal review by Red Hat Legal.
. The FCA will communicate the outcome of the BEAR review (approved or rejected) to you.
The BEAR approval is documented with a new comment in the request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
\&#42;Start Collecting Receipts Immediately!\&#42;

Once your funding is approved (by both the Fedora community and Red Hat's BEAR team, if applicable), you must begin collecting \&#42;itemized and dated receipts\&#42; for _every single expense_ you intend to claim in your FRR.

\&#42;Without proper itemized and dated receipts, Red Hat cannot reimburse your expenses.\&#42;
This is a strict requirement.
====


[[attend]]
== Stage 2: Attending Your Event \&amp; Crucial Expense Documentation

This stage covers your participation in the approved activity and the critical task of correctly documenting your expenses for the FRR.

[[participate]]
=== Step 2.1: Participate in Your Approved Activity

Attend your conference, deliver your talk, or participate in the Fedora activity as approved.

[[receipts]]
=== Step 2.2: Collect Itemized and Dated Receipts -- This is Critical!

Proper receipts are the cornerstone of your reimbursement claim.
Failure to collect the correct type of receipts will prevent reimbursement.

[WARNING]
====
\&#42;No Itemized, Dated Receipt = No Reimbursement\&#42;

Red Hat's policy strictly requires that you provide an \&#42;itemized\&#42; AND \&#42;dated\&#42; receipt for every expense.

\&#42; \&#42;Itemized Receipt\&#42;:
The receipt must clearly list each individual item or service purchased.
\&#42;\&#42; For example, a hotel bill (folio) must show the nightly rate and any individual charges.
A simple credit card transaction slip with a total amount is not sufficient.
\&#42; \&#42;Dated Receipt\&#42;:
The receipt must clearly show the date the expense was incurred.

Credit card statements or bank transaction lists alone are \&#42;not sufficient\&#42; because they are not itemized.
Always ask for and retain the detailed merchant receipt.
Make sure to get a proper receipt for transactions such as:

\&#42; \&#42;Airfare, train, or bus tickets\&#42;:
E-tickets and booking confirmations that show payment and travel details usually suffice.
\&#42; \&#42;Hotel folios\&#42;:
This is the final, itemized bill from the hotel at checkout.
\&#42; \&#42;Event registration fees\&#42;:
Confirmation emails showing payment are typical.
\&#42; \&#42;Visa application fees\&#42;:
An official receipt from the visa service is needed, if pre-approved in extraordinary circumstances.

Keep all physical receipts safe.
It is a good practice to take clear digital photos or scans of them as soon as you receive them.
====

[[report]]
=== Step 2.3: Prepare Your Event Report

For most Fedora-funded events, you are required to write an event report.
This could be a blog post or a summary on Fedora Discussion.
Alternatively, you can share social media posts about your participation and the event.

\&#42; Consult the Fedora Mindshare Committee's xref:mindshare-committee:ROOT:policy/events/reports.adoc[Event Report Policy] for guidance.
\&#42; Publish your report.
Keep the URL handy; you will need to provide this link when you submit your FRR.

[NOTE]
====
Flock, the annual Fedora contributor conference, is exempt from this mandatory reporting.
However, sharing your experiences is still highly encouraged!
====

[[submit-request]]
== Stage 3: Submitting Your Reimbursement Request via GitLab

After your event is over, and you have gathered all your receipts and prepared your event report, you can submit your FRR.

[[banking-info]]
=== Step 3.1: Prepare Your Banking Information for USD Deposit

Red Hat issues all reimbursements via direct bank deposit and \&#42;only in US Dollars (USD)\&#42;.

You will need to provide the following banking details accurately:

\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Your Full Legal Name\&#42;\&#42;:
This name must be exactly as it appears on your bank account.
\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Bank's Full Remit Address\&#42;\&#42;:
This is the complete legal address of your bank branch where your account is held.
\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Official Bank Proof Document\&#42;\&#42;:
This is a formal document from your bank that verifies your account details.
Examples include a voided check (if common in your banking system) or an official letter or statement from your bank containing all the below details.
It must clearly show:
\&#42;\&#42; Your full legal name as it appears on the account.
\&#42;\&#42; The bank's name and full remit address.
\&#42;\&#42; Your bank account number.
\&#42;\&#42; Relevant routing numbers (e.g., SWIFT/BIC code for international transfers, IBAN, ABA routing number, sort code, depending on your bank's location).
\&#42;\&#42; Ideally, it should also confirm the account's capability to receive USD deposits.

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Currency Conversion Fees Not Reimbursed\&#42;

You are responsible for ensuring your bank can process incoming USD international transfers.
Red Hat cannot reimburse any fees your bank might charge for receiving a USD deposit.
Nor can Red Hat reimburse any fees you might incur if you convert currencies yourself when making a payment.
The reimbursement will cover the USD equivalent of your approved expenses.
====

[[gitlab]]
=== Step 3.2: Create a Reimbursement Request Issue in GitLab

All FRRs are tracked as issues in the {url-ospo-sponsorship}[Red Hat OSPO Sponsorship GitLab repository].

. Navigate to:
{url-ospo-sponsorship}
. Create a \&#42;\&#42;New issue\&#42;\&#42;.
. Select the \&#42;\&#42;'Reimbursement Request'\&#42;\&#42; template from the 'Choose a template' dropdown.
. \&#42;\&#42;Crucially, ensure the 'This issue is confidential\&#8230;' checkbox at the bottom of the form is checked.\&#42;\&#42;
This protects your personal and financial information.
. Complete all fields in the template accurately:
\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;\&#42;Full legal name\&#42;\&#42;:
As per your bank records.

The Fedora Community Architect will manage these.

[[expense-docs]]
=== Step 3.3: Prepare and Submit Your Detailed Expense Documentation

After you open the FRR, the Fedora Community Architect (FCA) will be notified and will guide you on the next steps for submitting your detailed documentation.
The general process is as follows:

. \&#42;Expense Tracker Spreadsheet\&#42;:
The FCA will provide you with an expense tracker spreadsheet template.
You must meticulously complete this spreadsheet, listing each expense individually with:
\&#42;\&#42; Receipt Date
\&#42;\&#42; Receipt Description
\&#42;\&#42; Vendor
\&#42;\&#42; Amount (in the original currency of the transaction)
\&#42;\&#42; Currency Code (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, MXN)
\&#42;\&#42; Amount (converted to USD)
\&#42; \&#42;Currency Conversion to USD\&#42;:
If your expenses were not in USD, you need to convert each one to USD for the spreadsheet.
Use a reputable online currency converter (e.g., {url-wise-converter}[Wise.com]) for exchange rates applicable on the date you are preparing the spreadsheet.
Make a note of this conversion date in your spreadsheet (e.g., 'Conversions via Wise.com on YYYY-MM-DD').
The FCA will verify these conversions.

. \&#42;Submitting Your Documents (Receipts, Bank Proof, Spreadsheet)\&#42;:
\&#42; \&#42;Preferred Method\&#42;:
Secure Google Drive Folder
\&#42;\&#42; The FCA will typically create a secure Google Drive folder specifically for your FRR and share the link with you via email and as a comment in your confidential GitLab issue.
\&#42;\&#42; Upload the following to this Google Drive folder:
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; \&#42;Each itemized, dated receipt\&#42; as a separate, clearly named digital file (e.g., PDF, JPG, PNG).
Do _not_ combine all receipts into one giant file.
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Your \&#42;official bank proof document\&#42; (PDF format is preferred).
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; Your \&#42;completed expense tracker spreadsheet\&#42;.
\&#42; \&#42;Alternative Method\&#42;:
Email (if you do not have a Google Account)
\&#42;\&#42; If you do not have a Google account and cannot use Google Drive, please state this clearly in your GitLab reimbursement issue.
\&#42;\&#42; In this case, the FCA will instruct you to compile all your documents into a _single ZIP file_, including all receipts, your bank proof, and your completed expense tracker spreadsheet.
\&#42;\&#42; Email this ZIP file directly to the Fedora Community Architect at \&#96;fca [at] fedoraproject [dot] org\&#96;.


[[processing]]
== Stage 4: Reimbursement Processing by Red Hat (Internal Steps)

Once you have submitted all your documentation for your FRR, the Fedora Community Architect and internal Red Hat teams will handle the processing.
This stage is mostly for your awareness of what happens next.

\&#42; \&#42;FCA Verification\&#42;:
The FCA will thoroughly review your FRR and all submitted documents (receipts, bank proof, spreadsheet, event report link, BEAR approval if applicable).
\&#42; \&#42;GitLab Label Updates\&#42;:
As the FCA verifies each part of your submission, they will update the scoped labels on your GitLab issue (e.g., from \&#96;check1::needs triage\&#96; to \&#96;check1::approved in ticket\&#96;, then \&#96;check3::docs provided\&#96; once all documents are confirmed complete and correct).
\&#42; \&#42;Internal ServiceNow Request\&#42;:
Once the FRR passes all three checks, the FCA will create a 'Payment Exception Approval' request within Red Hat's internal ServiceNow system.
This internal request uses the information you provided (your legal name, bank details, USD expense totals) and attaches your collated documentation.
It also uses Red Hat internal details like GL Code (\&#96;721300\&#96;), Cost Center (\&#96;708\&#96;), and a reason for payment
(e.g., '_Reimbursement of BEAR-approved expenses for volunteering at the Fedora booth at the FOSDEM open source conference in February 2025._').
\&#42; \&#42;Manager Approval\&#42;:
The FCA's manager will then approve this Payment Exception Request directly within ServiceNow.

[[receiving]]
== Stage 5: Receiving Your Reimbursement

This is the final stage where you receive your funds.

\&#42; \&#42;Payment\&#42;:
After all internal Red Hat approvals are complete, the payment will be processed.
It will be deposited in USD into the bank account you provided.
\&#42; \&#42;Timeline\&#42;:
While there is no strict Service Level Agreement (SLA), Red Hat aims for a reimbursement turnaround of approximately \&#42;30 days\&#42;.
This 30-day period typically starts _after_ all your documentation has been correctly submitted, verified by the FCA, and the internal ServiceNow request has been fully approved.
Delays can occur if documentation is initially incomplete, incorrect, or if there are questions.
\&#42; \&#42;Payment Reference\&#42;:
When you receive the deposit, the payment reference or note from Red Hat will usually be in the format:
\&#96;Ticket redhat/ospo/sponsorship\&#35;XY. EVENT_NAME, MONTH YEAR.\&#96;
(e.g., '_Ticket redhat/ospo/sponsorship\&#35;123. FOSDEM, February 2025_').
This helps you identify the source and purpose of the funds.
\&#42; \&#42;Confirming Receipt of Funds\&#42;:
It is your responsibility to confirm when the reimbursement has been deposited into your account.
Once you have received the funds, you must add a comment to your confidential GitLab reimbursement issue.
This notification confirms to the Fedora Community Architect that the payment has been successfully received.
It also finalizes the reimbursement process for your request.
Timely confirmation is crucial for accurate tracking.

[IMPORTANT]
====
\&#42;Tax Liability Reminder\&#42;

As stated at the beginning, you are personally responsible for any and all tax obligations in your country of residence that may arise from receiving this reimbursement.

[[questions]]
== Questions or Need Help?

\&#42; \&#42;Fedora Community Approval Process\&#42;:
For questions related to the initial funding approval process within the Fedora Project, please consult the Fedora Mindshare Committee directly or the specific Fedora group handling the funding.
\&#42; \&#42;BEAR Pre-Approval or Reimbursement Submission\&#42;:
For questions about the xref:\&#35;bear[BEAR pre-approval process] or any part of the reimbursement submission process (Stages 3 onwards) _after_ you have Fedora community approval, your primary point of contact is the \&#42;Fedora Community Architect\&#42;.
You can reach them by:
\&#42;\&#42; Emailing \&#96;fca [at] fedoraproject [dot] org\&#96;.
\&#42;\&#42; Adding a comment to your confidential GitLab issue in the \&#96;{url-ospo-sponsorship}\&#96; or \&#96;{url-ospo-bear}\&#96; repositories (if your question is specific to an existing request).

[NOTE]
====
This documented process replaces older methods that Fedora contributors might have used in the past, including those involving different vendor onboarding steps or payment platforms like PayPal (which is no longer used for these reimbursements).
The aim is to provide a clear and consistent procedure aligned with current Red Hat policies.
