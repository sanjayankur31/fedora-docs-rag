# What is Fedora? {#_what_is_fedora}

The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a
free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share
user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we
make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff
with it.

&lt;&lt;&lt;

# What is Fedora all about? {#_what_is_fedora_all_about}

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different
views and approaches, but together we share some common values. We call
these the "&#42;Four Foundations&#42;": Freedom, Friends, Features, and
First.

# Our Vision {#_our_vision}

> *The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from
> free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and
> open-minded communities.*

As a project, we want everyone to live in a universe of free and open
source software; the user should be in control of their computing. But
it's not enough that the software is there, waiting to be used. It has
to be accessible and usable. This vision also reflects our community
approach --- the Friends foundation. Fedora isn't bits and bytes. Fedora
is our people, and we want the statement to include our vision of a
healthy community.

# Our Mission {#_our_mission}

> *Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
> containers that enables software developers and community members to
> build tailored solutions for their users.*

At the operating system level, we don't just integrate. We do new things
--- we build a *platform*, not just a distribution. The *Features* and
*First* foundations drive us to innovate. We do all of this as a
transparent, collaborative community of *Friends*, and entirely as open
source and free software --- *Freedom*.

# Our Method {#_our_method}

The Fedora Project is a center for innovation in free and open source
software. In our community, contributors of all kinds come together to
advance the ecosystem for the benefit of everyone. The Fedora community
contributes everything it builds back to the free and open source world
and continues to make advances of significance to the broader community,
as evidenced by the regular and rapid incorporation of its features into
other Linux distributions. Regardless of which Linux distribution you
use, you are relying on code developed within the Fedora Project.

We believe software patents are harmful, a hindrance to innovation in
software development, and are inconsistent with the values of free and
open source software. While tightly integrating proprietary and patent
encumbered components might superficially improve ease of use, this
practice does not benefit the community in the long run. The Fedora
community prefers approaches that benefit the progress of free software
in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of use.

# Our Community {#_our_community}

Fedora is more than just software. It is a community of contributors
from [around the world](https://fedoracommunity.org/), including
volunteers and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance
the interests of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join.
No matter what your skills are, we have a place for you in our
community! We are [software engineers](package-maintainers::index.xml),
[designers and artists](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design), [system
administrators](infra::index.xml), [web designers](websites::index.xml),
[writers](fedora-docs::index.xml),
[speakers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors),
[translators](localization::index.xml), and more --- and we are happy to
help you get started.

We believe that all contributors should [be excellent to each
other](https://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct). By creating an
environment for constructive contribution, we can more effectively and
successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best
solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and
strength of our community.

# Leadership and Governance {#_leadership_and_governance}

The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is responsible for stewardship
of the Fedora Project as a whole and supports the health and growth of
the Fedora Community. As in any large project, there are many different
levels of responsibility, accountability, and decision-making. As a
general rule, we want people working on a Fedora
[subproject](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Subprojects) to make
meaningful decisions about their areas of interest and expertise. More
details are available on our page on [Fedora
Leadership](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Leadership).

# Upstream First: A Core Fedora Principle {#_upstream_first_a_core_fedora_principle}

The concept of \'upstream first\' is a fundamental principle within the
Fedora Project. It shapes our history, culture, and approach to
contributing to the open source ecosystem. Understanding this principle
is crucial for anyone looking to contribute to Fedora and the broader
Linux distribution ecosystem.

## Fedora's Commitment to Upstream First {#upstream-why}

Fedora, as a Linux distribution, plays a unique role as an *integrator*
of countless software components. While Fedora develops some of its own
software, its primary function is to package and deliver a cohesive
operating system experience built upon the work of numerous upstream
projects.

From its inception, Fedora has championed the principle of *upstream
first*. This isn't a policy or hard rule; it's a core value woven into
the fabric of the Fedora community. Fedora contributors believe that
changes and improvements to open source software should, whenever
possible, be shared back with the upstream projects. This ensures that
&#42;all&#42; users of that software, not just Fedora users, can
benefit. Ultimately, Fedora's final objective is the benefit of the
user, and Fedora contributors will do what they think is best for the
user, even if upstream disagrees.

Upstream first is also a pragmatic engineering principle. By
contributing changes upstream, Fedora reduces the long-term maintenance
burden of carrying downstream-specific patches. Maintaining external
patch sets can become increasingly difficult as upstream projects
evolve. Embracing upstream first helps ensure the sustainability of
Fedora and its contributions.

This approach has a ripple effect throughout the open source ecosystem.
Changes landed in Fedora often impact numerous downstream projects that
use Fedora as a foundation. Therefore, contributing to Fedora is a
highly effective way to influence and improve the broader open source
landscape, particularly within the RPM/Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

By prioritizing upstream contributions, Fedora aligns with its vision of
a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built
by inclusive and welcoming communities. This commitment extends to
&#42;all&#42; open source software, not just Fedora itself.

## Understanding Upstream and Downstream {#upstream-downstream}

In the world of open source, projects often have interconnected
relationships described as \'upstream\' and \'downstream.\' The
*upstream* project is the original source of the software---the
foundation upon which other projects are built. *Downstream* projects,
in turn, are those that utilize and often modify the upstream software.
Think of it like a river: the upstream is the source, and downstream
projects are further along the flow, receiving and potentially altering
the water.

This metaphor is essential for understanding how open source projects
depend on and interact with each other. Different development models
encourage varying types of upstream/downstream relationships.

### Open Communication with Upstream {#upstream-communication}

Fedora recognizes the importance of clear and open communication with
upstream projects. We believe in fostering strong relationships with
upstream developers and communities, and actively seek their input and
feedback.

Fedora is always open to hearing from upstream projects about how we can
improve our collaboration and integration processes. We understand that
Fedora's downstream usage can sometimes create challenges or friction
for upstream projects. We encourage upstream maintainers to reach out to
us if they encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement.

Our goal is to work together constructively to find solutions that
benefit both Fedora and the upstream projects we rely on. While we
cannot always accommodate every upstream request, we are committed to
listening, learning, and adapting our practices to minimize any negative
impact on upstream communities.

The philosophy of working upstream first doesn't end with just
development. It also encompasses a productive, positive, and respectful
relationship with our upstream projects. Our communities overlap and we
want to extend our Fedora values to their project as much as we would
within Fedora. To that end we always want to deal with challenges
between projects together and have clear lines of communication.

### When Downstream Changes Happen {#upstream-exceptions}

While Fedora prioritizes upstream contributions, there are situations
where downstream-specific changes are necessary. These exceptions are
not contradictions of the upstream-first principle, but rather
acknowledgements of the complex realities of software development and
distribution.

Reasons for downstream patches include:

&#42; &#42;Upstream Rejection&#42;: Sometimes, upstream maintainers may
reject a patch for various reasons, even if it's beneficial to Fedora.
Fedora may still need to carry that patch to address a specific issue or
requirement. &#42; &#42;Upstream Progress&#42;: Upstream projects may
move forward with new features or changes that require significant
adaptation in Fedora. Fedora may need to backport fixes or implement
temporary workarounds while the downstream adaptation is completed.
&#42; &#42;Distribution-Specific Needs&#42;: Fedora, and its downstream
distributions like EPEL, may have unique requirements or constraints
that necessitate downstream modifications. These needs might relate to
specific hardware support, security considerations, or integration with
other Fedora components. &#42; &#42;Non-Free Blobs&#42;: Fedora is
committed to promoting free and open source software and building
everything from source. Sometimes, upstream projects include non-free or
pre-built binary blobs that Fedora needs to patch out to adhere to its
principles. While Fedora may discuss potential fixes with upstream,
these patches might not always be accepted if there are no suitable
alternatives or if they remove functionality.

In these situations, Fedora strives to minimize the scope and duration
of downstream patches, and continues to work towards upstreaming changes
whenever feasible. Understanding the reasons for downstream changes is
essential for maintaining transparency and trust within the community.

## Examples in Action {#examples}

The principle of \'upstream first\' manifests in various ways. Here are
a couple of examples:

&#42; &#42;Packaging Improvements&#42;: A Fedora packager identifies a
bug or missing feature in a build toolchain. Instead of creating a
Fedora-specific patch, they submit a patch upstream to the toolchain's
maintainers. After review and discussion, the patch is merged upstream,
benefiting all users of the toolchain and eliminating the need for a
downstream Fedora patch. &#42; &#42;Community Script&#42;: A Fedora
contributor develops a script for analyzing package data. They share the
script publicly. Another contributor enhances the script with new
features and submits a pull request. The original contributor merges the
changes, making the improved script available to the entire community.
&#42; &#42;License Clarifications&#42;: A Fedora packager discovers
licensing issues with an open source project, such as unclear or
non-compliant licenses for included assets. Instead of simply excluding
the project from Fedora, they work with the upstream developers to
clarify or correct the licenses. This ensures that the project can be
included in Fedora and benefits the broader open source community by
promoting license compliance. &#42; &#42;Avoiding Bundled
Dependencies&#42;: A Fedora packager notices that an upstream project
bundles a specific version of a dependency. Instead of using the bundled
dependency, they repackage the project to use the system-wide version of
the dependency. This ensures consistency across Fedora packages, enables
rapid security patch deployment, and maintains compatibility between
interdependent packages. &#42; &#42;Early Testing and Bug
Reporting&#42;: Fedora often pioneers the integration of new software
versions and libraries. This early adoption allows Fedora contributors
to identify and report build or compatibility bugs upstream,
particularly in the Python ecosystem. These contributions benefit the
entire open source community by ensuring smoother transitions and
upgrades for everyone.

These examples illustrate how upstream first fosters collaboration,
shared ownership, and continuous improvement within the open source
ecosystem. We encourage you to think about how you can apply the
\'Upstream First\' principle in your Fedora contributions. Have a story
about an upstream contribution? Share it with the community!

# Fedora Leadership {#_fedora_leadership}

The Fedora Project is led by contributors from across the community.
Different functional areas of Fedora at times evolve, build, or
dismantle their own formal (or informal!) leadership over time. Because
Fedora is an open source project, we encourage new contributors to
identify problems, find solutions, and collaborate with other members to
achieve results. Our community recognizes and empowers able leaders from
among our peers.

The Fedora Project aims to have a thin layer of governance that enables
decision making without excessive drag.

The following are current examples of *leadership groups* in Fedora.

## Fedora Council {#_fedora_council}

![council badge](council-badge.png)

The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is the topmost governance and
leadership body in Fedora, and is made up of appointed and elected
members from across the Fedora community. Details about the Council such
as size, constitution, and succession planning are found in the [Fedora
Council Charter](council::index.xml).

The [Fedora Project
Leader](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fpl/) (or \'FPL\')
serves as the chair of the Council.

## Fedora Engineering Steering Committee {#_fedora_engineering_steering_committee}

The [Fedora Engineering Steering Committee](fesco::index.xml) (commonly
known as \'FESCo\') is a community-elected body empowered by the Council
to manage the technical features of the Fedora distribution and specific
implementations of policy in the Fedora Project. You can find further
information about FESCo, its members, and its policies on the [FESCo
section](fesco::index.xml).

## Fedora Mindshare Committee {#_fedora_mindshare_committee}

The [Mindshare Committee](mindshare-committee::index.xml) represents
leadership for user and contributor community growth and support.

## Other groups {#_other_groups}

The list above is not a complete list of every group of empowered
community members. Other groups steer specific parts of Fedora as well,
empowered and supported by the relevant teams. The list above shows the
three leadership groups that most often work on issues of policy or
practice affecting large portions of the Fedora Project.

Community members are always encouraged to get involved in leading
Fedora in ways that are important to them, while minimizing overhead and
governance project-wide.

### Working Groups {#_working_groups}

Fedora [Editions](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Editions) ---
currently, [Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Atomic_WG),
[Server](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Server), and
[Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation), --- and
sometimes Fedora Project Objectives are lead by *Working Groups*. These
groups are either independent subcommittees of FESCo, Mindshare, or the
Council. They have formal membership and decision-making processes, but
generally the membership is intended to include active contributors and
the decision-making power reflects that. A seat on the Working Group
itself is *not at all* required to participate meaningfully in the work
on Editions or Objectives.

### Subprojects {#_subprojects}

[Subprojects](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/subprojects.html)
are long-standing major areas of effort under the overall Fedora
umbrella. Each subproject has its own governance.

### Special Interest Groups {#_special_interest_groups}

[Special Interest
Groups](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/sigs.html),
or \'SIGs\', are much less formal. The process for [creating a
SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Creating_a_Fedora_SIG) has &#42;no
red tape&#42;. Different SIGs have different structures; some use
formalized voting and others don't. Some SIGs may eventually become
subprojects; for others, the lightweight framework is perfect.

# How is Fedora Organized? {#_how_is_fedora_organized}

![Fedora Organizational Chart](orgchart.png)

Fedora is a big project, with many moving parts and dozens of groups and
subgroups. This chart gives a general overview and a sense of how things
fit together. The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is our overall
leadership and governance body. Most of the project is then roughly
organized under [FESCo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/)
(the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee) or the [Mindshare
Committee](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/).

[Engineering teams](engineering::index.xml) includes a list of technical
teams and initiatives, most of which operate under FESCo.

Since many groups are rather informal, don't take the chart as written
in stone. Also, if it is a little overwhelming, don't worry. Fedora is a
friendly project --- just pick an area you're interested in, introduce
yourself to the people involved, and get started. Or, if you don't know
where to start, see [how to get involved](join.xml).

# The Fedora Logo {#_the_fedora_logo}

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs,
including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth
tablecloths and banners, and other printed material.

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of
such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We
seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously
in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement
of free and open source software and content.

# The Dos and Donts of the Fedora Logo {#_the_dos_and_donts_of_the_fedora_logo}

Don't search for the logos on a search engine and use whatever you find
there. There are many unofficial variations on the Fedora logos that are
not authorized, are unofficial, and do not respect these guidelines.
Please do not use them or spread them further!

Here are some guidelines you should avoid if you would like to use some
of our logos:

# Colors {#_colors}

We keep a single color palette to keep our artwork consistent, whether
it is different Fedora materials, Fedora materials on screen, on the
web, or on printed materials. Past mistakes have included Fedora DVDs
coming out purple (true story!) so please pay attention to these colors,
and please always use CMYK colors for professionally-printed collateral
and objects such as printed banners, T-shirts, hats, and stickers.
Otherwise, your design may well come out purple instead of blue!

# Typography {#_typography}

We recommend the following complementary fonts to use along with the
logos. Both recommended fonts are openly licensed and freely
distributable.

We recommend using Open Sans as a body text / copy font. It comes in a
wide range of weights.

We recommend using Montserrat as a titling / headline font. Montserrat
is also used in the Fedora Editions logos.

# Characters {#_characters}

Most of these characters were created as part of the Fedora Characters
Revamp Project. These mascots can be used in different projects.

You will be introduced to Badger, Beefy, Panda and Colúr and their
history within the Fedora Community along with what part they belong to
as well.

## Panda {#_panda}

Panda is a happy go-lucky panda with glowing ears and a glowing nuclear
symbol on her stomach and was originally created as a helper. You were
able to find her on on the 404 and 500 pages and also was in the Fedora
Docs pointing out tips and tricks. Panda is female and is a general
mascot for the Fedora community. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake redesigned
the Panda during the Fedora Character Revamp Project.

## Badger {#_badger}

Badger is the Fedora Badges mascot and has been featured on a lot of
different badges throughout the years. Badger was fist inspired by a
popular early 2000's internet meme involving badgers and snakes. Badger
is non-binary. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake brought them to life by
creating a new style for the Badger to fit in to the Fedora style.

## Beefy {#_beefy}

Beefy is a general mascot for the Fedora Community. He was the release
name for Fedora 17 and has been a popular character even before Fedora
Linux! He became a meme between Linux users. Beefy is male and on his
belly, the mustard indicates progress. He was also a bootup screen for
Fedora in past years and as it was loading, the mustard on his belly
grew. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake revamped the style of Beefy and
created him in many poses. If you would like to know more about the
origins of the Beefy Miracle, please visit: <https://beefymiracle.org/>

## Colúr {#_colúr}

Colúr is our newest character that was created as a mascot for our Flock
events. In 2022, Jess Chitas created him to go along with the Flock
events and to also bring a new Fedora character to the table! He is
based on the Pink-Necked Green Pigeon and his name came from the Irish
meaning Pigeon but also sounds like the word \'Color\'.

However, if you need help working with the logo to make sure you are
following the guidelines or want to do something different with it,
please email <logo@fedoraproject.org> or log a ticket on the [Design
team's GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues)
and we would be delighted to help you!

# What are Community Initiatives? {#_what_are_community_initiatives}

Want to do something big? Have an idea that won't fit in a single
release cycle? Perhaps an improvement broader than the technical scope
covered by the Changes policy? Want to make sure the community is
aligned behind your goal, and that you have the resources and access you
need to make it happen? &#42;A Community Initiative may be the framework
for you!&#42;

Fedora Community Initiatives (formerly \'Objectives\') are projects
which do not fall neatly into the biannual Fedora Linux release cycle.
Typically they require longer to complete (e.g. 8-18 months) and are not
limited to engineering projects. Other key areas are administration;
documentations; outreach; motivation; communications; budgets and best
practice. Within the Project these are grouped under a heading of
[Mindshare](mindshare-committee::index.xml). The Council looks to
achieve a balance between engineering projects and those aligned with
Mindshare.

The primary role of the [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is to
identify the short-, medium-, and long-term goals of the Fedora
community and to organize and enable the project to best achieve them.
Anyone can propose a Community Initiative to the Council. To be
accepted, it should align with Fedora's [mission
statement](project::index.adoc&#35;_our_mission) and long-term goals.

Each Community Initiative has a designated Community Initiative Lead.
This Lead sits on the Council for the duration of the Initiative and is
responsible for coordinating efforts to reach the Community Initiative's
goals, as well as evaluating and reporting on progress. The Initiative
Lead works regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that
progress is made.

## Proposing a Community Initiative {#proposing}

To propose a Community Initiative to the Council, the Lead should first
discuss on the [&#35;council tag on Fedora
Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/council). Next, if
well-received, file a
[ticket](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/). Of course, people
need to be ready to do the actual work required --- a Community
Initiative without passionate bottom-liners will not get far.

To succeed, Community Initiatives require a leadership team with
division of responsibility. For example separating roles of project
leadership, engineering, marketing and documentation, depending on the
size and scope of the Initiative. The Council can assist a proposer in
finding the right people to work on the project if required.

### Executive Sponsors {#proposing-sponsors}

Every Community Initiative must have an Executive Sponsor. This can be
any current member of the Council -- even, possibly, the Lead of another
Initiative. You should find a sponsor as part of community discussion
before filing a ticket. Once someone has agreed to the responsibility,
the proposal can move forward.

#### Role of the Executive Sponsor {#proposing-sponsors-role}

A Fedora Council member becomes an Executive Sponsor until completion of
the Community Initiative or for the duration of their Council term
(whichever comes first). The Executive Sponsor is responsible for
partnering with the Lead as a connection point to the Fedora Project at
a high-level. The Executive Sponsor represents a wider view of what the
Fedora Project is focused on, whether that is in terms of the Fedora
strategy or a specific area of interest (e.g. DEI, Engineering,
Mindshare). The Executive Sponsor is not responsible for doing the work
directly, but rather as an advocate for the initiative and can help by
unlocking resources, help unblock work, act as a consultant on Council
and Project perspectives and generally supporting the initiative to
allow the work to succeed.

An Executive Sponsor may find that they are no longer able to fill this
role for a Community Initiative, whether due to an expiring Council term
or that they do not have the capacity to continue. In this event, the
Executive Sponsor and the Lead must work together to identify another
Fedora Council member who can be the Executive Sponsor.

#### Relationship between Lead and Executive Sponsor {#proposing-sponsors-relationship}

How the Community Initiative Lead and the Executive Sponsor collaborate
is largely up to them. However, it is suggested that the Lead and
Sponsor have a regular meeting cadence (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) to
check in on progress and identify challenges. The Lead should provide
updates to the Executive Sponsor on the work, engagement with the
community, and requests for help in order to succeed. The Lead should
expect the Executive Sponsor to ask them questions, suggest other teams
or people to collaborate with, and give suggestions on how to acquire
the needed resources to succeed. Periodically, the Executive Sponsor
will ask the Lead to share progress or milestones back to the wider
Fedora Council.

## How are Community Initiatives Finalized? {#completing}

At the end of the expected duration of the Initiative (as specified at
the proposal / acceptance stage), the Council will assess the progress
of the Initiative. If all of the aims or the most significant of them
are achieved, the Initiative will be terminated. If the aims are nearly
complete and further work substantially increases the impact, it may be
allowed to continue for a further agreed period. After that, it will be
terminated. Initiatives will not be allowed to run indefinitely.

## Current 12-18 Month Community Initiatives {#current}

This section documents the current Initiatives the Council have
accepted:

### Git Forge Initiative 2025 {#forge}

Vision

:   To empower Fedora developers and the Fedora community with a
    streamlined workflow through a consolidated Git source control and
    issue tracking solution, powered by Forgejo on Fedora
    Infrastructure.

Mission

:   To consolidate Fedora's source code management, issue tracking, and
    project hosting onto a single Forgejo platform deployed on the
    Fedora OpenShift Cluster, replacing Bugzilla and sun-setting Pagure
    (src.fedoraproject.org and pagure.io), while offering a migration
    path for Fedora Project repositories currently hosted on external
    platforms.

Community Initiative Lead

:   Ryan Lerch ([\@ryanlerch]({url_wiki}/User:Ryanlerch))

Executive Sponsor

:   Aoife Moloney ([\@amoloney]({url_wiki}/User:Amoloney)), with Jef
    Spaleta ([\@jspaleta]({url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta)) filling in for
    Aoife's maternity leave

Timeframe

:   18 months

Community Initiative Details

:   See the [wiki
    page]({url_wiki}/Initiatives/Git_Forge_Initiative_2025).

## History

See [completed Community Initiatives]({url_wiki}/Objectives/Completed)
and [potential Community Initiatives]({url_wiki}/Objectives/Potential).

Historically, Community Initiatives were known as Objectives. This
transition was made in February 2023 following in-person discussion by
the Fedora Council in our 2023 Council hackfest in Frankfurt, Germany.
We agreed to convert \'Objectives\' into \'Community Initiatives\',
which the Council felt was easier to understand and communicate the
roles of these efforts in Fedora. There is no functional change to
Objectives; it is just a semantic change.

# Communication in Fedora {#_communication_in_fedora}

As referenced on the [Get Involved](join.xml) page below, Fedora is a
massive global organisation with many people with different skills
carrying out different roles. As you get involved you may need to find
assistance and the [Getting Help](help.xml) page can help you with that.
This current page goes into more detail around the various communication
channels within the Project.

## Primary Channels {#_primary_channels}

### Chat {#_chat}

We now use [Matrix/Element](https://chat.fedoraproject.org) as the
primary synchronous channel to speak to each other in real time.

You can find a list of the Fedora channels on Matrix
[here](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/&#35;/room/&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org).

### Fedora Discussion {#_fedora_discussion}

[Fedora Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none)
is the primary discussion forum where you will find all the latest news
&amp; announcements, as well as discussion about open source projects;
workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Fedora Editions.
See also under [Getting Help](help.xml).

### Ask Fedora {#_ask_fedora}

[Ask Fedora](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) sits
within Fedora Discussion and is the main community knowledge base and
support forum hosted by the Fedora Project. Ask Fedora is a good place
to go for support and troubleshooting help, as mentioned on the [Getting
Help](help.xml) page.

## Other Communication Channels {#_other_communication_channels}

As above, [Fedora
Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) is now
the primary platform for longer asynchronous discussions where
short-lived chats may not be enough. Some teams do still use mailing
lists though. The most significant mailing lists are:

&#42;
[announce](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[devel](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[devel-announce](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[test](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/)

For a catalog of all the mailing lists look at
[lists.fedoraproject.org](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/)

[Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org) is a great resource for
user-facing announcements and cool stories about usage, features,
etc&#8230;

[Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org) brings
you contributor-facing announcements and updates. Within the Community
Blog you'll also find [Friday's Fedora
Facts](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/).
These are weekly posts with status updates, schedule info, etc..

The Fedora Pagure source control repository allows posting of
[issues](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/issues) which can
be discussed, assigned and remediated. Here you can raise issues or
view, comment on, and request to act on open issues.

There are a number of official and other social media accounts, on
various networks. You can find details of these documented on the
[Marketing Social
Networks](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_social_networks) Wiki
page.

## Etiquette {#_etiquette}

In all our interactions, we aspire to *be excellent to each other*. Read
the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.xml) to learn more of what is
expected of Fedora community members.

# Getting Help {#_getting_help}

There are several places to find help:

## Quick Docs {#_quick_docs}

Firstly, [Fedora Quick
Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/) is a collection
of short HOWTO and FAQ style documentation for Fedora users.

## Fedora Documentation {#_fedora_documentation}

Then there is the [official
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/). Many answers
can be found here. If you don't find what you need in the documentation
or you need more detail, you can ask a question via the forums below.

## Fedora Discussion {#_fedora_discussion_2}

Fedora has a strong community that is ready to help you. Because users
and contributors span the globe, a key element to the project is
communication. See the [Project Communications](communications.xml) page
for more details.

[Ask Fedora](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) is the
main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora
Project within Fedora Discussion (below). Visit Ask Fedora for support
and troubleshooting help.

Within [Fedora Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/) you
will find all the latest news &amp; announcements. It is also the place
to talk about open source projects, workflows, and Fedora-specific
offerings such as the Editions: Fedora Workstation, Fedora Server,
Fedora CoreOS, Fedora Silverblue, and more&#8230;.

## Fedora Chat {#_fedora_chat}

[Fedora's official chat platform](https://chat.fedoraproject.org)
(powered by Matrix) is the place to go for more synchronous, real time
communication. Fedora Chat on Matrix is the preferred platform for the
future of Fedora Chat, however many of the Fedora Linux channels on IRC
at Libera Chat are still bridged to Fedora Chat on Matrix to allow
continued use of IRC during the transition.

If you're interested in &#42;why&#42; Fedora's primary communications
are moving to Matrix, check out [this
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2A8BdU1gKg) on the Fedora
YouTube channel by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller.

## Bugzilla {#_bugzilla}

If you believe you've found a bug you can report it through
[Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/). The [\'Using
Bugzilla\'](quick-docs::bugzilla/index.xml) page will give you any
guidance you need to do this. You can also ask on [Ask Fedora (as
above)](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) to get advice
on filing a good bug report.

# Get Involved {#_get_involved}

![Welcome to Fedora banner](Welcome-to-Fedora-banner.png)

Welcome to Fedora!

This guide is intended for people that are interested in learning more
about Fedora, perhaps with the intention of getting involved and
contributing to the community.

You can refer to the [Getting Help](help.xml) and [Project
Communications](communications.xml) pages for more specific information
on how to find assistance via documentation and the various
communication channels, such as Ask Fedora, and Fedora Chat (powered by
Matrix).

## What is Fedora? {#_what_is_fedora_2}

As described under [Mission and Foundations](index.xml), the Fedora
Project is a community of people working together to build a Free and
Open Source software platform: the [Fedora Operating
System](https://getfedora.org), and its various editions. You can learn
more about the Project; our leadership; brand; current Community
Initiatives and how we are organised using the pages linked in the left
hand sidebar.

If you are looking to contribute and already have an idea of how and
what to do, go ahead and get started! If you are not so sure, read on.

## Contributing to Fedora {#_contributing_to_fedora}

Fedora is a [massive global organisation](orgchart.xml) where people
with many different skills carry out [different
roles](fedora-join::index.xml) to keep the community ticking along. All
services used by the Fedora community are linked to a central Fedora
account. If you're intending to get involved you should get one
[here](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/).

There is an excellent [article in Fedora
Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-contribute-to-fedora/)
covering in some detail the various ways you might get started.

## Not sure where to start? Come hang out with us! {#_not_sure_where_to_start_come_hang_out_with_us}

The large scale of the community can sometimes make it a little daunting
for new folks to join us. There is far too much happening in Fedora all
the time\-\--even we find it hard to keep up with it all! So, if you are
not sure of where to begin or have any queries at all, come hang out
with the [Fedora Join Special Interest Group
(SIG)](fedora-join::index.xml) on any of our channels:

- Chat (over Matrix/Element): [Join Fedora on
  Matrix/Element](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/&#35;/room/&#35;join:fedoraproject.org),

- Email: [Fedora Join mailing
  list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/),

Here, you can speak to community members and other newcomers while we
explore Fedora together. We will help you learn the systems and
processes that the Fedora community uses, and as you gain a better idea
of where you would like to contribute, we will also help you learn the
skills that you may need.

Taking initiative is an important quality in successful contributors.
So, go on, join a channel and introduce yourself to the community now!

# Sponsorship {#_sponsorship}

Fedora has thousands of regular contributors who give freely of their
time and efforts on a continual basis. Participating in the community is
a great way to support Fedora.

Companies may also choose to sponsor the annual [Flock to Fedora
conference](https://flocktofedora.org/) or our other in-person or
virtual events. These events connect our community and power the
collaboration that makes the Fedora Project work. Sponsorships allow us
to bring together contributors from around the world --- including
people who might otherwise be unable to join. Contact
<sponsors@fedoraproject.org> for more information.

To mirror the package repositories, see the [Mirroring
page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring) or

# Fedora Code of Conduct {#_fedora_code_of_conduct}

Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community,
Organization for Ethical Source, Python Software Foundation, Emma Irwin
v2.1, 2026-01-15 :page-aliases: council::policy/coc-response-policy.adoc

The Fedora Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our
community behaves and what we value to members and outsiders. The Fedora
Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and if it
is deemed necessary.

The Fedora Code of Conduct is not "code" in the sense of being an
algorithm or a computer program. The Fedora Code of Conduct is not
"blindly and algorithmically" executed but is instead enforced by humans
making real decisions based on all of the available information and
using all available context.

The Fedora Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize
non-native speakers of English. Instead the Fedora Code of Conduct
spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be
acceptable or unacceptable. The Fedora Code of Conduct is, in many ways,
the outward embodiment of the Friends component of Fedora's Foundations.

## Our Pledge {#pledge}

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
the Fedora community pledge to collaborate in a respectful and
constructive manner, and welcome everyone willing to join us in that
pledge. We welcome individuals regardless of ability, age, background,
body size, education, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and
expression, geographic location, level of experience, marital status,
nationality, national origin, native language, personal appearance, race
and/or ethnicity, religion, sexual identity and orientation,
socioeconomic status, or any other dimension of diversity.

Our channels, mailing lists, and posts should focus on Fedora and on
free and open source software and content. We pledge to make
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone. We pledge to avoid personal attacks on others,
and to avoid inflammatory language and speech that perpetuates
discrimination. Furthermore, we pledge to not use the Fedora Project and
its platforms as a basis to engage in personal campaigns against other
organizations or individuals.

## Our Standards {#standards}

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

&#42; Using welcoming and inclusive language &#42; Being kind to others
&#42; Behaving with civility &#42; Being respectful of differing
viewpoints and experiences &#42; Gracefully accepting constructive
criticism &#42; Focusing on what is best for the community &#42; Showing
empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

&#42; The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
attention or advances &#42; Initiating controversy for controversy's
sake (repeatedly asking disingenuous questions under a guise of
sincerity) &#42; Saying insulting/derogatory comments and making
personal attacks. &#42; Repeatedly instigating conflict, and baiting
people into arguments &#42; Public or private harassment &#42;
Publishing someone else's private information, such as a physical or
electronic address, without explicit permission &#42; Deliberate
intimidation, stalking, or following &#42; Violent threats or language
directed against another person &#42; Sexist, racist, homophobic,
transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary statements, even if they were
meant as jokes &#42; Excessive swearing &#42; Unwelcome physical contact
&#42; Sustained disruption of talks or other events &#42; Other conduct
which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
setting even if the conduct may be legal under the laws of some
jurisdiction.

## Our Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

The Fedora Council is committed to enforcing this Fedora Code of Conduct
in a fair and impartial manner so that Fedora community members are able
to participate in the Fedora Project and its associated activities in a
safe and respectful environment. To achieve this, the Council has
delegated responsibility to a [Fedora Code of Conduct
Committee](committee.xml) for clarifying and interpreting the standards
of acceptable behavior, responding to and investigating reports of
behavior that is not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct and
determining appropriate and fair corrective action in response. The
Committee will perform these functions along with the Red Hat Legal
team, as appropriate.

Within their respective areas of participation Fedora Community members
have the right in their sole discretion and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct. Those
Fedora Community members are expected to exercise these rights in
alignment with the Fedora Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Fedora Code of Conduct applies in all online and offline project
spaces and in all online and offline spaces where an individual is
representing the project, its community, or is acting as a community
member.

Examples of acting as a community member include:

&#42; Posting to a Fedora mailing list, &#42; Filing a bug with Fedora,
&#42; Participating in official Fedora communication channels (i.e.
Fedora Discussion, Fedora Chat/Matrix) &#42; Contributing to the Fedora
Project in any form &#42; Using an official project email address &#42;
Posting via an official social media account &#42; Acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event &#42; Speaking
for Fedora or its subprojects at a public event or online video &#42;
Working in a Fedora or related booth or table at an event &#42;
Participating in a Fedora or related technical meetup &#42; Serving as
an elected or appointed leader in Fedora, including being a member of
the Fedora Council

## Reporting and Enforcement {#reporting}

Instances of behavior inconsistent with this code may be reported by
contacting the Fedora project by filing a private Fedora Code of Conduct
ticket at <https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue>. If the incident occurs at
an event, the local event staff should be contacted in addition to
opening a ticket.

Individuals without access to <https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue> may send
an email to the following address: <codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org>.
This email will be converted into a private Fedora Code of Conduct
ticket by the [Fedora Code of Conduct Committee](committee.xml).

All reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with
anyone we will anonymize details as much as we can. This means that the
identities of all involved parties will remain confidential unless those
individuals instruct us otherwise or we are required to make disclosures
under the law. Additionally, in some cases we may need to disclose this
information to other parties at Red Hat. Fedora is not a separate legal
entity and therefore has to comply with all requirements imposed upon
Red Hat.

Upon our review/investigation of the reported incident, we will
determine what action is appropriate based on this Code and its
clarifying statements. An incident review will include communication
with the reporter and the individual being reported, and an opportunity
for both parties to provide an account of the incident.

All complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response. Failure
to follow this Code may result in actions including, but not limited to,
warnings, temporary suspension, and in extreme circumstances, banning
from the Fedora Project. Please note, while we take all
concerns/reported incidents raised seriously, we will use our discretion
to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents.

### Our Stance on Retaliation {#retaliation}

The Fedora Project is committed to ensuring that community members feel
safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative
consequences. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good
faith, reports a potential violation of this Fedora Code of Conduct or
assists in its investigation.

#### Protection for Reporters and Participants {#protection-from-retaliation}

No one should face threats, harassment, discrimination, or any other
form of retaliation for:

&#42; Making a good faith report of behavior they believe violates this
Fedora Code of Conduct. &#42; Participating in the investigation of a
Fedora Code of Conduct report, including serving as a witness or
providing information. This protection explicitly extends to members of
the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee in the execution of their duties.

\'Good faith\' means that you honestly believe the information you are
providing is accurate, even if an investigation does not ultimately
confirm the violation.

Acts of retaliation are serious violations of this Fedora Code of
Conduct. The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will address any confirmed
instance of retaliation with appropriate corrective action, consistent
with the enforcement of other Fedora Code of Conduct violations. If you
believe you are being retaliated against, please report it to the Fedora
Code of Conduct Committee using the same reporting channels outlined in
the \'Reporting and Enforcement\' section.

#### Addressing False Reports {#false-reports}

We expect all community members to act responsibly when making reports.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will investigate all reports. If
the Committee determines, after thorough investigation, that a report
was intentionally made with false information and with malicious intent
(for example, to harass or silence someone), this action itself will be
considered a violation of the Code of Conduct. An unsubstantiated
report, when made in good faith, is not considered a false report.

Covenant, version 1.4 along with material from the PyCon Code of Conduct

# Clarifying Notes and Statements {#_clarifying_notes_and_statements}

Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community v2.1,
2026-01-15 :page-aliases: project::coc-clarifying.adoc

The [Fedora Code of Conduct](index.xml) (CoC) outlines our shared values
and standards. However, applying these high-level principles to specific
situations requires clarity. The Fedora Code of Conduct and its
associated documents are "living documents." They will change over time
as the Fedora community changes. This supplemental document serves as an
extension of the main policy, to provide additional background and
clarification to the Fedora CoC. It ensures that enforcement is
consistent and that community members understand how the Fedora CoC
applies to real-world scenarios, including event visibility and the
protections afforded to those who report violations.

## Visibility and Awareness {#visibility}

A Code of Conduct is only effective if the community is aware of it and
understands the reporting procedures. To ensure this transparency, the
following standards apply to all Fedora operations:

&#42; &#42;Digital Presence&#42;: The Fedora Code of Conduct and its
associated documents must be linked in the footer of all major Fedora
websites and, where possible, in other project communications.

&#42; &#42;Event Prominence&#42;: All events must prominently display
the Fedora Code of Conduct. Organizers must publish event-specific
notes, including designated points of contact.

&#42; &#42;In-Person Reporting&#42;: If an event supports in-person
reporting, the specific process for doing so must be clearly and
prominently displayed.

&#42; &#42;Physical Signage&#42;: In-person events organized by Fedora
must provide physical copies of the Fedora Code of Conduct or display
clear signage regarding it for attendees.

&#42; &#42;Online Events&#42;: Virtual events must display a link to the
Fedora Code of Conduct prominently on the event home page.

&#42; &#42;Registration Acknowledgement&#42;: Where the platform allows,
online events should require attendees to agree to abide by the Fedora
Code of Conduct as a mandatory step in the registration process.

## Why was the word "contributor" from the Contributor Covenant adapted when it was adapted for Fedora? {#adapting-contributor}

We need a Code of Conduct that speaks to everyone who interacts with our
community. Many of us may understand the word "contributor" to encompass
everyone from a mailing list participant, forum poster, bug reporter,
documentarian, designer, developer, etc., but not everyone understands
it this way. Additionally, many of our events are attended by users.
Speaking about the community is a more clear definition of the
individuals covered in this Code.

## Rationale for Retaliation Clause (v2.1) {#retaliation}

This update codifies a zero-tolerance stance on retaliation to ensure
community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without
fear of negative consequences. Any confirmed act of retaliation is
considered a serious, standalone violation of the Fedora CoC and will be
met with appropriate corrective action. The new section explicitly
extends protections to reporters, witnesses, and Fedora Code of Conduct
Committee members acting in good faith. Additionally, it distinguishes
between unsubstantiated good-faith claims and malicious false reporting,
establishing the latter as a violation to preserve the integrity of the
enforcement process.

As of version 2.1, the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee has explicitly
codified our stance on retaliation to close a critical gap in community
safety. It was determined that for the Fedora CoC to be truly effective,
reporters must feel empowered to come forward without fear of
professional or social backlash. Silence caused by fear of retribution
undermines the health of the entire project.

# Fedora Code of Conduct Committee {#_fedora_code_of_conduct_committee}

The Code of Conduct Committee consists of the Fedora Project Leader, the
Fedora Community Architect, and Fedora community members. Members of the
Code of Conduct Committee will be provided with incident response
training and guidelines around Fedora's [Code of
Conduct](index.adoc&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement).

## Members

The current Code of Conduct Committee is comprised of:

&#42; Jef Spaleta ([Fedora Project Leader](council::fpl.xml)) &#42;
Justin Wheeler ([Fedora Community Architect](council::fca.xml)) &#42;
Jona Azizaj ([DEI Advisor](dei:roles:council-advisor.xml)) &#42; Dave
Cantrell (Fedora Council &amp; FESCo member) &#42; Ankur Sinha (Fedora
community member) &#42; Chris Onoja Idoko (Fedora community member)

## Responsibilities of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee {#responsibilities}

The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will:

&#42; Accept, acknowledge, and investigate reports of possible
violations of the Code of Conduct from community members and/or
moderators. This will include communications with people who submit
reports, reported persons, witnesses, and Red Hat Legal, as appropriate.
This will also involve communications with other members of the
Committee by text or video call to deliberate and resolve reports.
Additional details about the reporting and response processes are
documented on the [Reporting Process Information
page](index.adoc&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement). &#42; In cases where a
Code of Conduct violation has occurred, determine what action should be
taken by the Fedora Project. These will typically take the form of
remedial guidance, a set of consequences for the reported person, and/or
possible recommendations for new policies or rules for the Fedora
Project. &#42; Accept and acknowledge requests for clarifications about
the Code of Conduct, and provide a response once any necessary
communications and deliberations are complete. &#42; Make reporting as
appropriate about incidents, including an annual report summarizing
incidents over the last year. &#42;&#42; This report will be statistical
in nature to illustrate the process is functioning. &#42;&#42; Past
reports can be found under the [Code of Conduct
tag](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/code-of-conduct/) on
the Community Blog.

## Adding or Removing Members to the Code of Conduct Committee {#adding-removing}

The Fedora Project Leader and Fedora Community Architect are members of
the Code of Conduct Committee, regardless of who holds these roles.
Ideally, the Committee should have at least three members at all times,
and no more than seven. The Fedora Council will be notified of all
changes in membership to the Fedora Conduct Committee. Adding and
removing members to the Committee will happen from time to time for a

Members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee involved in
investigating reports and making recommendations for resolution of Code
of Conduct violations are required to uphold the following principles,
ensuring that bias, lack of confidentiality and conflicts of interest do
not impact the outcome of a Code of Conduct determination.

&#42;&#42;I agree to adhere to the Fedora Code of Conduct, in both
letter and spirit, and acknowledge that violating the Code could result
in removal from the Committee.&#42;&#42;

&#42;&#42;I agree to keep the process, any facts I learn, and any
evidence I review confidential, and agree to discuss them only with
individuals who are part of the process&#42;&#42; (e.g. Fedora Code of
Conduct Committee members, Red Hat Legal, or other designated
individuals).

&#42;&#42;I will recuse myself if I cannot be fair and impartial in an
individual case, due to my personal involvement with the parties
involved.&#42;&#42; If I have questions about recusal, I will consult
the Fedora Community Architect and/or the Fedora Project Leader.

&#42;&#42;I agree that I will review Code of Conduct reports, conduct
investigations, and make recommendations fairly and
impartially.&#42;&#42;

&#42;&#42;I will review the reports and deliberate only in confidential
sessions, with the outcome to be shared only with the parties and others
as determined on a need-to-know basis.&#42;&#42; (e.g. system
administrators, moderators, or project leads.)

&#42;&#42;I will respect the process and outcome, recognizing that the
Committee decision is the product of the Code of Conduct Committee, even
if I do not personally agree, my recommendations are rejected, or I am
part of the minority.&#42;&#42;

commitments and agree to follow them in your role as a member of the
