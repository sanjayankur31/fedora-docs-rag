= ELN Special Interest Group

ELN SIG is a Fedora Special Interest Group which is responsible for the ELN
project and its infrastructure.

The official SIG membership list is maintained as part of our Github Organization and can be viewed https://github.com/orgs/fedora-eln/people[here].

== Responsibilities

* Own the scope and configuration of the `eln` disttag and buildroot (see
xref:buildroot.adoc[ELN Buildroot]).

** As the project evolves the scope might change. There might be additional
features which will be included into the tag or excluded from it.

* Define ELN content set

* Own the configuration of the compose (see xref:compose.adoc[ELN Compose]).

* Maintain infrastructure required to build packages and composes.

* Track the status of package builds and composes. Work with Fedora package
maintainers to resolve the issues.

* Keep track of the xref:eln-macros.adoc[RHEL and ELN conditionals] in RPM spec files.

* Investigate compose failures

* Own buildroot configuration

== Communication

* Mailing list: Add *[ELN]* to the subject of an email to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel@ mailing list]

* Matrix Room: https://matrix.to/#/#eln:fedoraproject.org[#eln:fedoraproject.org]

=== Issue tracker

* https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues

=== Meetings

Meetings of the ELN Special Interest Group are held on Tuesdays at 12:00, US Eastern Time in the Fedora Meeting 1 room on Matrix. It is listed on the https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/SIGs/[SIGs calendar].

The meeting agenda will generally be prepared in advance by opening tickets on the https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues[issue tracker] and tagging them with the `Meeting` label.

== How to Join

Anyone may join the SIG by asking to become a member. If no existing SIG member *opposes* that request within a week, they're in. If an existing SIG member opposes, we will hold a regular vote at the next scheduled meeting as described above.

Prospective members may ask to join by filing a "New Member Request" ticket on the https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues/new/choose[issue tracker].
= Frequently Asked Questions =

Why ELN?::

The Fedora distribution is, among other things, an https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/fedora-and-red-hat-enterprise-linux/[upstream] for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). By adjusting buildroot and assorted
configurations, ELN allows Fedora contributors who work on RHEL and other similarly targeted downstreams to judge the state of upstream from their perspective. The benefit for the Fedora distribution is that contributors who work on both upstream and downstream stay more continuously connected to the state of Fedora -- especially, but not exclusively, Rawhide.

What is the role of ELN with respect to CentOS Stream?::

ELN is a continuous rebuild of Fedora Rawhide sources. Once in a while a
certain snapshot of the ELN is used to bootstrap the new CentOS Stream for
the new major RHEL release. There is no continuous sync between ELN and
any version of the CentOS Stream. Bootstrap activity happens only once for
each CentOS Stream version. See the picture:


image::ROOT:fedora-eln-centos-stream-rhel.png[]


What are the differences between Rawhide and ELN?::

For the majority of packages, there is little or no difference between Rawhide and
ELN packages.  They are the same versions, usually built on the same libraries.  But
there are some https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/eln/buildroot/[buildroot differences]
in https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/eln/buildroot/#_compiler_flags_and_other_tweaks[compiler flags]
and https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/eln/buildroot/#_distribution_related_macro_definitions[global macros]
that can result in build differences.

Note: Many packages have %if fedora / rhel conditionals in their specfiles that produce
differences between the built Rawhide and ELN packages.  Listing all of those differences
is beyond the scope of this document.

What packaging guidelines does ELN follow?::

Unless otherwise specified in this document, Fedora ELN is required to follow all published
Fedora Packaging Guidelines. One common divergence is with the use of bundled dependencies.
In general, Fedora packaging recommends that all packages unbundle their dependencies into
separate packages. However, in some instances this can result in a single package requiring
many (dozens or hundreds) of additional packages. Because of legal restrictions on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux placed on it for distribution in major markets, it is preferred that such
cases are instead packaged singly.

What are the differences between the Rawhide and ELN kernel?::

Kernel is one of the packages that uses %if fedora conditionals extensively. While the source
tree is the same, the Rawhide kernel uses a Fedora configuration and the ELN kernel is built
with a RHEL kernel configuration. As a result, the Rawhide kernel tends to enable support for
a much larger range of hardware and features.  A notable difference is that the ELN kernel
does not support btrfs at all, making it difficult to install and use on systems that were
installed as Fedora Workstation edition, or in Fedora 35 or newer Cloud images which use btrfs
by default.  There are also differences in baseline supported hardware, meaning the ELN kernel
may not run on older systems where the Rawhide kernel runs just fine.

When should I use the rpm macro %\{eln}?::

Never.  In nearly all cases, you actually want to use the %\{rhel} macro.
See xref:eln-macros.adoc[ELN Macros] for more information.

There is no browser preinstalled in ELN, what should I do?::

RHEL 11 will only ship and preinstall the Firefox RHEL Flatpak and not its RPM version. Because
ELN follows closely what RHEL 11 will be, it does not include a RPM version of Firefox by default,
and also no Flatpaks are produced for ELN. To get your installed systems as close as possible to RHEL 11,
we suggest you to install Firefox Fedora Flatpak by following the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/flatpak/installation/[installation guide for Fedora Flatpaks]
or Firefox RHEL Flatpak by following the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/administering_the_system_using_the_gnome_desktop_environment/assembly_installing-applications-using-flatpak_administering-the-system-using-the-gnome-desktop-environment[installation guide for RHEL Flatpaks].
Alternatively, there is a `firefox` RPM in the ELN Extras repository.  KDE users may also wish to
install `angelfish`, `falkon`, and/or `konqueror` RPMs, except on s390x where they are not available.

See also xref:compose.adoc[Compose].

== Container image

As a part of the compose, we build container images which are then published to Quay.io image registry under the name ``quay.io/fedora/eln``.

To create and use Fedora ELN container, run:

```
podman run -it quay.io/fedora/eln
```

== Toolbx image

As a part of the compose, we build https://containertoolbx.org/[Toolbx] images which are then published to Quay.io image registry under the name ``quay.io/fedora/eln-toolbox``.

To run Fedora ELN with Toolbx, first create the container:

```
toolbox create --image quay.io/fedora/eln-toolbox eln-toolbox
```

Then run:

```
toolbox enter eln-toolbox
```

== Cloud images

As a part of the compose, we build Cloud images for AWS, Azure, and GCP.  These are uploaded to each cloud provider on a regular basis as a community offering.

To use, search for **ELN** among community images when creating a new instance.

== WSL images

As a part of the compose, we build WSL images for both Windows architectures:
https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/eln/1/BaseOS/x86_64/images/[x64]
https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/eln/1/BaseOS/aarch64/images/[arm64]

To install and use the first time, download the .wsl image, double-click the downloaded file, and follow the prompts in the terminal.

For subsequent usage, launch the **Fedora-ELN** entry in the Start Menu, or run in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```
wsl -d Fedora-ELN
```

For more details, see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cloud/wsl/[the Fedora on WSL documentation].

== Live images

As a part of the compose, we build GNOME, KDE, and COSMIC Live images similar to https://sigs.centos.org/altimages/live-images/[those produced by the CentOS Alternative Images SIG].
These images contain content from the ELN Extras repository which will not necessarily be in the next RHEL version but may end up in EPEL.

Live media can be found here:

https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/eln/1/Extras/aarch64/iso/[aarch64]

== Mock environment

To build custom packages for ELN you can setup Mock environment as described at xref:buildroot.adoc[Buildroot].
= Buildroot configuration =

== Versioning

In ELN project we work on the buildroot configuration rather than the content of Fedora packages. As ELN
buildroot configuration may change frequently and independently from Fedora releases, it has its own
versioning.

This approach allows us to rebuild RPM packages on buildroot changes without changing the spec file of a
package in dist-git.

ELN Buildroot version is written as `XY`.

The `X` version refers to major changes in the ELN buildroot (generally those events that necessitate a
mass-rebuild). The `Y` version refers to changes in the buildroot configuration that are compatible and will
apply to future builds in the ELN buildroot.

We start this number at `100`, where `1` is the X version and `00` is the Y version.

== Distribution-related Macro Definitions

In ELN buildroot we build Fedora Rawhide packages in the EL-like setting. Thus, following macro values are set
by default:

.Macros values
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================================
|Macro         |Value         | Description
| `%\{fedora}` | `%\{nil}`    | Unset
| `%\{rhel}`   | `11`         | Integer value one higher than the most recently released major version of RHEL
| `%\{eln}`    | `XY`         | Version of the eln buildroot. Not tied to any RHEL or Fedora release.
| `%\{dist}`   | `.eln%\{eln}`| eln-disttag, for example `.eln101`
|==============================================================================================================


We set these values in Koji for the eln-build tag as follows:

```
koji edit-tag \
-x rpm.macro.fedora=%{nil} \
-x rpm.macro.rhel=9 \
-x rpm.macro.eln=101 \
-x 'rpm.macro.dist=%{!?distprefix0:%{?distprefix}}%{expand:%{lua:for i=0,9999 do print("%{?distprefix" .. i .."}") end}}.eln%{eln}%{?with_bootstrap:~bootstrap}' \
eln-build
```

== Compiler flags and other tweaks

.Compiler Flags
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================================
| Arch         | Rawhide                        | ELN
| aarch64      | -                              | -
| ppc64le      | `-mcpu=power8 -mtune=power8`   | `-mcpu=power9 -mtune=power10`

|==============================================================================================================

The compiler flag tweaks can be found in /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros
The above options are from redhat-rpm-config-200-1


[#building]
== Building with the ELN buildroot

Simply specify `eln` as the release when kicking off a `koji` build using `fedpkg`:

```
fedpkg --release eln build [--scratch] [--srpm [SRPM]] [...]
```

`mock` can also be used to perform builds locally.

A supported `mock` configuration is available in the `mock-core-configs` package version 33 or later.
This enables the ELN environment to be used locally by running (for arch `x86_64`):

```
mock -r fedora-eln-x86_64 ...
```

[NOTE]
====
If the official `mock` configuration is not yet available, an unsupported configuration file can be downloaded link:{attachmentsdir}/fedora-eln-x86_64.cfg[here]. See link:https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/649[mock#649]

= Resolving ELN build failures =

This page provides information to assist package maintainers remediate
ELN build failures.


== Background

For general information about ELN, visit the xref:index.adoc[overview].

Note what’s different with the xref:buildroot.adoc[buildroot] for ELN.

The set of packages that currently need to build for ELN can be found at
https://tiny.distro.builders/view\--view-eln.html.
The expanded package set including build dependencies can be found at
https://tiny.distro.builders/view\--view-eln-and-buildroot.html.

There is also an xref:status.adoc#_eln_builds[ELN Build Status page] showing
which packages are currently failing to build for ELN, as well as those
that have a discrepancy between Fedora Rawhide and ELN builds.


== Debugging ELN build failures

Check the details about xref:buildroot.adoc#building[how to build]
with `koji` and `mock` using the ELN buildroot.


== Fixing ELN build failures

=== If the package doesn't build for Rawhide, fix that first!

IMPORTANT: If the package doesn't build for Rawhide, fix that first!

If the package doesn't build for Rawhide, fix that first!

Is that message loud and clear enough?
Getting the package build fixed for Rawhide may very well be all that's
needed to fix it for ELN as well.


=== Accounting for differences between Fedora and RHEL

Most build failures can be fixed by modifying the SPEC file.
However, such modifications should be kept to a minimum.

If your package needs to institute different code paths or package
dependencies between Fedora and RHEL, it is important to only account
for the difference for the releases where it is required.

Generally, this means limiting the difference in old versions of Fedora,
while letting the next version of RHEL adopt the Fedora code path.

As one common scenario where a difference is required, RHEL often ends
up with a smaller set of dependencies than Fedora.
The `%\{fedora}` and `%\{rhel}` macros, when defined, contain the major
release versions per distro.

Consider this SPEC file snippet:

```
%if 0%{?fedora} >= 29 || 0%{?rhel} >= 9
BuildRequires: SomePackage
%endif
```

This conditional will be met when `%\{rhel}` is defined as 9 or greater.
It is also shareable between earlier and later versions of Fedora and RHEL.
Often it is better to use `<` to limit behaviors to RHEL 8 and earlier:

```
%if 0%{?fedora} < 32 && 0%{?rhel} < 9
%global rhel8orearlier 1
%else
%global rhel9orlater 1
%endif
```

The best spec files alter default behavior only for released versions of
Fedora or RHEL, making the default policy the one applicable to the
current versions of Fedora or RHEL.

As a last resort, there is an `%\{eln}` macro available.
Using it should be avoided if at all possible.
However, if you find you do need to use it you should only check if it
is set to a non-zero value.
For example:

```
%if 0%{?eln}
# something specific to ELN only
...
%endif

%if 0%{?fedora} || 0%{?eln}
# something specific to Fedora or ELN
...
%endif

%if 0%{?rhel} && ! 0%{?eln}
# something specific to RHEL only, not ELN.
...
%endif
```


=== Python 2 deprecation

Just as recent Fedora releases have deprecated Python 2, so have RHEL 9 and ELN.
There has been a recurring pattern with ELN build failures that can be
resolved by adjusting the SPEC conditionals to disable Python 2.
For example, if you have something like this:

```
%if 0%{?fedora} >= 30
%global python2_enabled 0
%else
%global python2_enabled 1
%endif
```

Change the conditional to:

```
%if 0%{?fedora} >= 30 || 0%{?rhel} >= 9
```


=== Architecture dependencies

ELN is built for the same set of architectures as Rawhide.
However, the kernel package in ELN no longer produces a full
kernel for any 32-bit architecture.
Notably, there is no `kernel` package for architecture `armv7hl`,
only the `kernel-headers` package.
To help address this difference, there is a new `%\{kernel_arches}` macro
available that can be used in the SPEC file. For example:

```
%ifarch %{kernel_arches}
BuildRequires: kernel
%else
BuildRequires: kernel-headers
%fi
```
= ELN Branches

Whenever possible, ELN work should be done in the Fedora rawhide branches.
But sometimes ELN work needs to be done in an Fedora eln branch.  Here are
the steps for making that happen.

== Step 1: Request Permission

To prevent a large amount of unmaintained ELN branches as well as to
ensure that ELN's automation does not continue to overwrite changes with
builds from the Rawhide branch, the ELN SIG must approve each request
for a branch.

To request permission, create an https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues[ELN Issue].

Be sure to include why you need an eln branch, as well as who will be
maintaining the eln branch.

== Step 2: Create Branch

=== You ARE the Fedora maintainer

If you are a Fedora maintainer of the package needing a branch, then
the next step if fairly simple.

....
fedpkg request-branch eln --no-auto-module --repo <package>
....

=== You ARE NOT the Fedora maintainer

If you are not a Fedora maintainer for the package then you need to ask
one of the Fedora maintainers to create an ELN branch.

If you want to follow the formal route for requesting a branch, then
open a bugzilla ticket for the package.

[NOTE]
.Bugzilla fields for an ELN branch request (alternative)
====
* Classification: Fedora
* Product: Fedora
* Component: <package>
* Version: rawhide
* Summary: Please branch <package> in eln
====

Clear out Description and put

....
Please branch <package> in eln

fedpkg request-branch eln --no-auto-module --repo <package>

I will be maintaining the eln branch.

If you do not think you will be able to do this in a timely manner
and/or would like me to be a co-maintainer, please add me (FAS <your FAS Id>)
as a co-maintaine through https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/<package>/adduser
....

== Step 3: Maintain Branch

After your branch has been created, remember that the ELN branch is your
responsibility.  Do not create the branch, build it once, and then never
touch the branch again.

*If you decide that you no longer need the ELN branch  Do not retire the branch.
You must tell the ELN SIG.* The ELN SIG will need to change configurations as
well as retire the branch properly.
= ELN Macros

The ELN buildroot defines the %\{rhel\} macro as the next major version of RHEL
(currently, 11), and does not define the %\{fedora\} macro.  For almost all cases,
this is sufficient for differentiating build behavior between Fedora and ELN.

== Request Permission

To avoid unnecessary divergence between ELN and the next version of RHEL,
the ELN SIG must approve each request for use of the %\{eln\} macro.

To request permission, create an https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues[ELN Issue].

Be sure to include why you need to distinguish ELN from RHEL and/or CentOS Stream,
and why use of the %\{fedora\}, %\{rhel\}, and/or %\{centos\} macros does not suffice.

== Approved Uses of the %\{eln\} Macro

= ELN Extras

ELN-Extras is essentially an extension of Fedora ELN, with the primary
difference being that the content in ELN-Extras will be defined by the
Fedora/EPEL community, while ELN's content is largely decided upon by
Red Hat management. This will offer users the opportunity to make sure
their applications will work on upcoming releases of RHEL as well as
providing a bootstrapping mechanism for EPEL. It will be far easier
and quicker to get a compose of EPEL N+1 out the door if the initial
packages have already been built for ELN-Extras.

NOTE: **You** are responsible when your package fails to build on ELN
Extras.  Remember to check your packages on
https://sgallagh.fedorapeople.org/dbs_status.html[the
ELN Status Page].  ELN Extras packages get rebuilt much more frequently
than in EPEL.

== How to Add a Package to ELN Extras

Adding packages to ELN Extras, is the same as adding them to ELN.
The only difference is that any Fedora packager can add packages
to ELN Extras, while only a handful of people can add packages
to ELN.

You add binary packages by creating and submitting workloads for
https://github.com/minimization/content-resolver#readme[Content Resolver].
You submit them as pull requests at
https://github.com/minimization/content-resolver-input[content resolver input].
The workloads go in the config directory.

Once the workloads have been merged, Content Resolver works through
all the dependencies of the workload, subtracts those packages that are
already in ELN, and displays it in its
link:++https://tiny.distro.builders/view--view-eln-extras.html++[ELN Extras view].

After Content Resolver has worked it work, the ELN build process takes that
list and adds it to the ELN Extras build list.

=== Workloads

The full documentation on what goes in a workload yaml file can be found  as comments in the
https://github.com/minimization/content-resolver/blob/master/config_specs/workload.yaml[example workload yaml file].

The create your initial workload yaml file, take that example yaml file, rename it,
edit it, then submit it as a pull request.

The example workload yaml has an example for everything.  But we don't need everything
for ELN Extras.

==== Workload Required Sections

=== ELN-only packages
:link-epel-packages: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/epel-faq/#rhel_8_has_binaries_in_the_release_but_is_missing_some_corresponding__devel_package._how_do_i_build_a_package_that_needs_that_missing__devel_package

ELN-only packages can also be added to ELN Extras.
One example is {link-epel-packages}[-epel packages]
which are often used to provide subpackages that have been unshipped or otherwise excluded in RHEL. These packages can be added to ELN Extras, with some additional caveats:

* similarly to regular -epel packages, the package needs to only produce the needed subpackages and nothing else
* the package needs to be manually built for ELN from the "eln" branch in dist-git
* the SRPM name has to be different from the corresponding Rawhide package (https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libxcrypt-epel[example])
* the SRPM name has to be added to the exclusion list in ELNBuildSync to avoid accidental rebuilds (https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/commit/f50f8d99596cee37fa2b15cd3c62f1c8e86e72fa[example])
* the needed subpackages need to be added to Content Resolver for ELN Extras as usual (https://github.com/minimization/content-resolver-input/pull/1124[example])

== ELN Extras Frequently Asked Questions

Can I add any or all Fedora packages to ELN-Extras?::

You are attaching your name as the supporter of these packages.
You will be submitting these workload packages as pull requests.
The ELN SIG will review the pull requests and ask questions if
things look strange or incorrect.  So, yes, if you are willing
to support a package, it can be any Fedora package not in ELN.
And while we are not putting a firm limit on the number of packages
you can add to ELN Extras, the SIG is reviewing them and will
not merge requests that seem excessive for the person requesting them.

If someone has already added a package to their workload, can I have the same package in mine?::

Yes.  Content Resolver is setup to deal with a package in more than
one workload, or a dependency in more than one workload.  It will show what
workloads list, or require what packages.  It even takes a guess on who
should be the owner of the package.

Fedora Branching happens every 6 months, when Fedora Rawhide branches for the next release. All examples used in this portion of the document will be for when Fedora Rawhide is branched for Fedora 41 and Rawhide becomes Fedora 42.


=== Branching Tasks ===
. Pause the Fedora ELN package rebuilds in ELNBuildSync
** Set the `configuration.control.pause` value in the ELNBuildSync https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to `true`
. Wait for the Fedora ELN Buildroot to regenerate

$ koji wait-repo eln-build --request

. Update `configuration.trigger.rpms` in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to the next Fedora tag (`f42`)

. Resume ELN package rebuilds in ELNBuildSync
** Set the `configuration.control.pause` value in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to `false`

. Once a new batch has been processed,footnote:tagdelay[This timing avoids an accidental mass rebuild from being started due to the mass retagging of rawhide builds with the new tag.] then update `rpm.macro.eln` for the `eln-build` Koji tag with the next available number.footnote:elntag[Current settings are visible on the https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taginfo?tagID=22493[eln-build koji page]] For example, if the current value is 141

$ koji edit-tag eln-build -x rpm.macro.eln=142

NOTE: It's not necessary to wait for ongoing builds to complete before updating the macro and trigger. The only reason for the pause is to ensure that nothing else starts before the new trigger is set.


== Fedora Branching and a new CentOS Stream ==
This event occurs at the Fedora Branching event that corresponds to the launch of a new major release of CentOS Stream. Generally, this will be every three years (or six Fedora releases). All examples used in this portion of the document will be for when Fedora Rawhide is branched for Fedora 40, Rawhide becomes Fedora 41 and CentOS Stream 10 is being launched.

=== Branching Tasks ===
==== On the Fedora Side ====
. Pause the Fedora ELN package rebuilds in ELNBuildSync
** Set the `configuration.control.pause` value in the ELNBuildSync https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to `true`
. Wait for any ongoing Fedora ELN builds to complete.
** Detecting this requires access to the ELNBuildSync logs which are non-public at this time.
. Disable the DistroBuildSync from Fedora ELN to CentOS Stream
** Set `enabled: false` in the CentOS Stream distrobaker.yaml footnote:internal[Requires access inside the Red Hat firewall]
. Update `rpm.macro.eln` for the `eln-build` Koji tag with the next available number.footnote:elntag[Current settings are visible on the https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taginfo?tagID=22493[eln-build koji page]] For example, if the current value is 135

$ koji edit-tag eln-build -x rpm.macro.eln=136

. Update `rpm.macro.rhel` for the `eln-build` Koji tag with the next major release value.footnote:elntag[Current settings are visible on the https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taginfo?tagID=22493[eln-build koji page]] For example, if the current value is 10

$ koji edit-tag eln-build -x rpm.macro.rhel=11

. Wait for the Fedora ELN Buildroot to regenerate

$ koji wait-repo eln-build --request

. Update the https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-release[fedora-release] package
.. Set `rhel_dist_version` to the same value as `rpm.macro.rhel` above.
.. Rebuild the `fedora-release` package, coordinating with Fedora Release Engineering
. Update `kiwibuild_version` in https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/blob/eln/f/fedora/override.conf to the same value as `rpm.macro.rhel` above
. Update `configuration.trigger.rpms` in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to the next Fedora tag (`f41`)
. Resume ELN package rebuilds in ELNBuildSync
** Set the `configuration.control.pause` value in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/ci-cd/distrosync/distrobuildsync-config/-/blob/main/distrobaker.yaml[distrobaker.yaml] to `false`
. Schedule a mass-rebuild of Fedora ELN to pick up any pending RHEL X+1 changes.footnote:[For example, frame pointer enablement is conditionalized as `%if 0%{?rhel} >= 11`]
= Fedora ELN compose =

== Summary ==

The Fedora ELN compose is built using the
https://docs.pagure.org/pungi/[Pungi] compose tool.

The compose is run automatically four times per day, at 0300, 1500, 1800 and
2100 UTC, though only the first successful compose each day is normally synced
to the mirrors. The https://tiny.distro.builders/[Content Resolver] uses each
of the composes for input processing to maintain an accurate view of the state
of ELN throughout the day. The additional composes also serve to provide an
early-warning system of trouble so it can be addressed before the next day's
synced compose.


== Compose configuration files ==

The main Fedora ELN compose configuration is stored in the official
https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/ repository in the ``eln`` branch.

The Fedora ELN compose uses the ``comps-eln.xml`` file stored in the
https://pagure.io/fedora-comps repository.


== Generating the Fedora ELN compose ==

Members of the
https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/sysadmin-eln/[sysadmin-eln] FAS group
can manually generate a Fedora ELN compose by logging into the compose host
and performing the following steps:

[NOTE]
The first time you need to log in to an infrastructure compose host, you will
need to set up your SSH configuration as described in
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/sshaccess/#_ssh_configuration[Fedora Infrastructure Documentation].

1. Log in to compose-eln01.iad2.fedoraproject.org
2. Verify that no compose is already running with ``ps -ef|grep pungi-koji``
or a similar command.
3. Edit the file ``/etc/cron.d/eln``, copying the line containing
``eln-nightly.sh`` to a new line and modifying the cron syntax to start the
compose two minutes in the future. For example, if the current time is
1520 UTC, you would set the cron configuration to ``22 15 * * *``.
4. Wait for the compose to start, verifying that it did so with
``ps -ef|grep pungi-koji``
5. Remove the additional entry in ``/etc/cron.d/eln`` so that it does not
continue to trigger at the same time each day.
6. (Optional) Monitor the overall compose progress with
``tail -f /mnt/koji/compose/eln/<compose_id>/logs/global/pungi.global.log``

[NOTE]
Normally, the ELN compose will only be synced to the mirror list the first
time that a compose succeeds for that day. In rare situations, this may need
to be overridden. In this case, you will need to modify the command used to
launch the compose to include a ``-f`` argument to ``eln-nightly.sh``.
