* Welcome!

Fedora is not just an Operating System.  It is the future.  A future for how we work, how we play, how we make and how we communicate.  The technology that Fedora builds first is integrated into some of the world's most important infrastructure.

We are the people that build Fedora.  Some of us came here to make something we just had to, some for a life-long career and some to be with people with similar skills and interests.

People join Fedora with all kinds of skill sets.  Some are advanced engineers with many years experience, others have just left high school.  Wherever you are in your journey, Fedora welcomes you to participate in our community.   We welcome people from all over the planet.  We support diversity of all types as it strengthens the whole.

If you support the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/[code of conduct] and link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/[core values] of Freedom, Friends, Features and First there will likely be somewhere for you to fit in. If you want to know what makes a good contributor to Fedora, link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/contribute/successful-contributor/[we have a section on that].

Fedora is not strictly speaking a software development centre. One of our core principles is link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/upstream-first/[Upstream First]. This is so we can give back to the broader Linux community.

Fedora is divided into a number of working areas.  You can see our link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/orgchart/[organization chart].
We do everything from running servers and writing code to design and event management.

If you would like to be part of our community, you do not need to know everything or promise much.  We want you to learn, connect and identify what you would like to become.  We will not give you a job.  We will help you find your way around the Fedora ecosystem to find a group or project that fits your skills.

You do not need to sign up to do this yourself.  Feel free to join in on our link:https://chat.fedoraproject.org/[Matrix Channel] or our link:https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[discussion forums].
It is a good idea to read the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[docs] (plus other places!) and have a good look around before contacting us.

As a newcomer to Fedora, all your access starts with an account. link:https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[Sign up here]. You will be asked for your name and a username.  The name and username you put in may be public, but you can put in whatever you like.  You can change your name later, but you cannot easily change your username.

It really helps us if you introduce yourself on Matrix or on the forums.  We want to know who you are so we can work together better.
Don't be afraid of saying too much, if you like cooking or anime as well as Python and Inkscape many of us will too!  A good working environment lets you talk about all the things that interest you (as long as it fits the code of conduct).  Just don't publish your home address or passwords!

Feel free to approach people in your areas of interest.  We want to double the number of contributors we have, and we want to make sure Fedora has an active and engaging future.  When approaching people, write as much as you can.  Lay out neatly and succinctly and give as much information as you want to receive.  People here like to read, and the more you tell us the more we can tell you.

You will be 'Fedora' when you have found and made your first contribution to a project or group.

Once you have decided you would like to stick around, or would like a hand getting introduced, we can 'onboard' you.  This means we will give you a little bit more access to systems and can introduce you to teams.  The 'behind the scenes' process is detailed below, it's up to you if you want to know how we do it.

To begin the onboarding, we need to know your username.  All you have to do is

1) Login to link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora[Pagure] with your Fedora account once, and
2) Reachout via link:https://matrix.to/#/%23join%3Afedoraproject.org?via=fedora.im&via=matrix.org&via=4d2.org[Join Fedora on Matrix] or on the link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/[mailing list which you can subscribe]

And that is it!  You are one of us now, for as long as you would like.

Remember, there is no minimum commitment.  Take the time to look around.

> *We would of course recommend you to use Fedora :)*



When a new person joins the Fedora community, they may not know what they want to do.
The Join SIG aims to help people to explore the community and find their area of interest.

We go through the following steps with the new person.

1) We tag tickets.
- Tags starting with "S:" track the status of the ticket from their perspective.
- Tags starting with "C:" track the status of the ticket from the community's perspective.
- Tags starting with "I:" track their interests.

2) We ask $USER to subscribe to the Fedora Join mailing list.
This is so people can interact via e-mail if they wish, and can stay informed on what happens in the community. The associated tag is: link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+Subscribed[S: Subscribed].

3) We open a new "Hello Fedora World" ticket for the $USER and add them to the `fedora-join` group in Pagure. The associated tag is: link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+Hello+Fedora+world[S: Hello Fedora World].

4) We ask the $USER to introduce themselves, preferably via the mailing list. The associated tag is: link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Introduction+requested[C: Introduction requested].
When $USER have introduced themself, we mark the ticket with the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+Introduced+myself[S: Introduced myself] tag.

- People can comment on their tickets whenever they need to ask questions, to give feedback, or just to chat.

- When the $USER need a response, they can use the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Needs+response[C: Needs response] tag to gain the community's attention.

- The $USER then spend time exploring Fedora, speaking to people, learning how things work; all at their own pace. $USER is not expected to do any tasks at this time. The idea is to get comfortable with the Fedora community and ecosystem before contributing.

5) Every two weeks we check to see how the $USER is doing. Each time we do so, we set a new tag.
At the first progress check, we will set the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Progress+check+1[C: Progress check 1] tag.
If we do not hear from the $USER in approximately two weeks, we do a second progress check and set the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Progress+check+2[C: Progress check 2] tag.

- If we do not hear from the $USER again for another two weeks, we do a final progress check. We set the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Progress+check+3+-+Final[C: Progress check 3 - Final] tag.

- If we do not hear from the $USER in the total of 6 weeks, we assume that the $USER is inactive and close the ticket with the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+User+unresponsive[S: User unresponsive] tag.

6) Some infrastructure in Fedora requires users to be part of a team or group on the Fedora Account System.
We can give temporary membership to the "Fedora-Join" FAS group if a new user requires.  This can be requested by setting the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Temporary+membership+needed[C: Temporary membership needed] tag. After discussing the situation, if temporary membership to the FAS group is given, we will mark the ticket with the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=C%3A+Temporary+membership+approved[C: Temporary membership approved] tag, and grant the temporary membership.

7) When $USER feel that they no longer need our help or don't have the time, we can close the ticket.
If $USER decide to exit the Fedora community we will close the ticket with the tag link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+User+closed[S: User closed]. The $USER can re-engage with the community or re-open the ticket anytime.

8) As the $USER learn about the community and ecosystem, they will hopefully find tasks and teams that interest them.  When the $USER have joined a team, they has become a contributing Fedora community member! We mark the ticket as link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+I+am+Fedora[S: I am Fedora] to celebrate this.

9) We collect feedback from new community members at any time and at close of ticket. For this, we use the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+Feedback[S: Feedback].

10) When $USER comments that they don't have time to interact with the community, we can close the ticket. Let them know that they can have it reopened once they have some time to spare.

* Classroom

:experimental:

The Fedora Classroom is a project to help people spread knowledge to others. We host a plethora of sessions on different subjects.


* Recordings of sessions are made available on the {YOUTUBE}[Fedora Youtube channel].
* Follow up questions on the sessions can be asked on {DISCOURSE_CLASSROOM}[Discourse under the classroom sub-category].
* Suggestions for new sessions should be made on {PAGURE}/issues[our Pagure project].


We are moving away from a live streaming to a {FWIKI}/Classroom/OfflineSessionsProposal[recording based deliverly model].
This helps us get the sessions to more people, and it helps us focus on the quality of the material instead of the technology involved.

Therefore, we are no longer bound by {FWIKI}/Classroom/Release_schedule[release cycle based calendar].


Please refer to {FWIKI}/ScreenCasting for information on tools that can be used to record sessions.


Community members that instruct sessions earn https://pagure.io/Fedora-Badges/issue/523[badges]!
These are awarded automatically for sessions that are held in https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-classroom[#fedora-classroom] IRC channel.
For sessions that are held on other platforms, a https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/645[ticket must be filed to award the badge manually].


We are available via our https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/classroom[mailing list].

We are also on the IRC at https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-classroom[#fedora-classroom]. We use the
{PAGURE}/new_issue[Pagure project] to manage our tickets.


If you would like to help out the Fedora Classroom effort, we are currently xref:classroom/help-wanted[looking for assistance] in several areas.

The purpose of the classroom is to provide instruction on a specific topic. As such, it is beneficial for
classroom sessions to adhere to a certain standard. Please try to adhere to the following during sessions:

* Keep in mind that classroom sessions may be logged
* Adhere to teacher instructions regarding questions and input
* Avoid unnecessary actions, nick changes and away messages
* Avoid off-topic conversation

The point is to help maintain a classroom environment that promotes learning while avoiding extraneous content.


If you would like to teach a class on any Fedora related topic, please mail an introduction of yourself
and outline of your proposed class to the classroom mailing list. Some things to keep in mind:

* *We recommend sessions be approximately 90 minutes*  This allows for an hour long session and enough time for questions and answers.
* Make sure you know your subject and know where to point students who wish more detailed information.
* Note at the beginning of your class if you would like students to ask questions as you go, or would prefer them to wait until the end.
* Remember that typing is slower than talking in front of a class or speaking on a phone call, so keep in mind you will not cover as much on IRC.
* All teacher notes and class resources should be licensed as "CC 4.0 unported international license"

(Note: Check out http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html?year=2008&month=12&day=6&p1=195&p2=179&p3=1038&p4=47[The World Clock Meeting Planner]
for time zone syncing.)


In order to write a magazine post announcing the fedora classroom, please follow the guidelines here: {FWIKI}/Classroom/magazine_template[Magazine Template].

:experimental:

The Fedora Classroom is always looking for interested people to help out.
A checklist of tasks can be found {FWIKI}/Classroom_Checklist[here].

The work can be classified into the following roles.

*Note*: anyone interested in filling the positions listed below should contact xref:index.adoc#_communication[Fedora Join SIG].


Keep things rolling week in, week out:

* keep wiki page up to date - schedule, volunteer lists
* keep fedocal up to date
* ensure Magazine POC writes, schedules, and publishes post on time
* ensure CommBlog POC writes, schedules, and publishes post on time
* create survey for session
* send out reminder to the announce mailing list
* summarise session, analyse information collected from survey
* write summary report every release


Know something about Fedora Project? Whether it be big or small, we want
you to come and share your knowledge. Instructors are always needed to
present to interested parties.  The topic is up to you and it can be basic
or very in-depth. Even if you don't feel like your topic is very advanced,
many folks love to hear about new and amazing things.  Please come and take
the time to present!


This position would have you look around for people who use Fedora or are
associated with Fedora and are interested/willing/able to teach
classes. You would explain to them how the classes work and help them
setup their class schedules and so forth. This position could also look
for people who have interesting blog posts or mailing list postings or
are active on IRC and ask them to teach some classes.


Working with the Fedora Marketing team, this position would have you mail
out class schedules, make blog posts, and any other ways you can think of
to get out the message about classes and how to attend them. It would help
to be subscribed to various fedora lists and/or be active at fedoraforum.org.


For this position, you would need to be well versed in IRC setup and usage
and be able to be available at various times when classes are held.
People in this job would introduce classes, answer general questions
about the sessions and help control disruptive students or the like.
The Emcee should also be able to upload logs of just completed classes
to the wiki.


* Policies


IMPORTANT: The removal from a member from the FAS group is merely an act of acknowledging that someone is no longer active.

We all understand that sometimes we need to take a step away from our volunteer work to focus on other things.
This can happen for many reasons, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking a break from volunteering in the Fedora community when required.
In such cases, primarily for housekeeping, we remove inactive members from the FAS/Pagure groups.

When community members are able to return, their membership to the groups will be restored.
I.e., they will not have to start again from zero.
Just as they retain their friends in the Fedora community even when they are away, they also retain the community's trust when away.

We'd like to note that the intention here is not to "_kick people out of the community_" at all.
We do not mark FAS accounts as inactive---we only update Fedora Join related groups (FAS/Pagure).
Please also note that other teams may have their own policies regarding inactive community members.

When the team detects a team member to be inactive, generally for long periods of time (a year or so), we:

1. ping/nudge/poke the team member to request a status update: to see how they are doing and if we can do anything to help,
2. open a ticket on the Fedora Join Pagure instance to follow up on progress.

The ping/nudge/poke message could be like this:

----
Hello,

Our records indicate that you have not been active in the community for at least a year.

We hope everything is fine. Is there anything we can help with?
----

If a response indicating inactivity is received (or no response is received at all), the team will:

1. remove the member from the FAS and Pagure groups,
2. close the ticket with its status set to "inactive".


The scripts that is used to check for activity can be found here: https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/FedoraCommunityStats[Fedora Community Stats].


Ankur Sinha
2023-10-30: Updated content, rewritten various sections.

Everyone starts as a new member of the community.
This page aims to provide some tips and tricks of how to go about being a successful community member.
It notes what members of the community expect from one another.

In the Fedora community, students, professionals and hobbyists all come together to promote Free/Open Source Software.
We do this by packaging software to produce a well integrated operating system (a "Linux distribution").

But, that is not all we do!
We also do lots of design work, promotion work, marketing, create cool artwork, videos, and podcasts, write both technical and non-technical (like this one) documentation, outreach, training, and more.
In fact, non-code contributions are a critical component of the Fedora community, and the community could not exist without them.
Just hanging out in the channels and participating in discussion is also contributing.

// TODO: check ref to council documentation
TIP: Take a look at the Fedora organization chart xref:project::orgchart.adoc[here].
It'll give you an idea of the vastness of the community.


So you think that you would enjoy being a Fedora community member?
Great!!
You are most welcome.

Everyone that joins a Free/Open source software project does so with the best intentions of staying.
However, the realities of life mean that volunteering requires us to take time out of our lives, time that could be spent elsewhere: on jobs to earn a salary, life and family and friends, or other hobbies and projects.
The biggest difference between those that are able to stay and remain long term contributors and those that are not is "commitment and time".


An important question is: what does one get out of volunteering?

Volunteering anywhere in projects that interest you can be very rewarding.
With Fedora, for example, introducing someone new to Free/Open Source software is extremely satisfying.

However, personal satisfaction for doing something we believe in is not all we get in return for our participation.
By working together and openly, we members of the community share perspectives, experiences, knowledge, skills, and resources with each other.
Most of us learn and improve a variety of different skills while contributing to the community.
We also learn about other cultures and experiences from our fellow community members.

All of this can also be very beneficial in a professional context, since it helps to demonstrate skills that are highly sought in industry: collaboration, technical skills, real world and management experience, and more.

Note that none of this acts as a replacement for a salary or an income.
While the community does sponsor community members to organize and attend community events, there is no financial return for participation.
So, managing time to ensure that work and other aspects of life do not suffer is paramount.
More about that in the next section.


TIP: Make sure you look after your personal and professional commitments before making time to volunteer.

A work-life balance is most important.
In most cases, it is your free time after work, time that you can spend on yourself and your friends and family, that you reduce to volunteer.
So, let your friends and family know that you are volunteering, and make sure you continue to make time for them.

TIP: Confirm with your employer before volunteering during work hours.

If you plan to contribute during your working hours, you should speak with your employer to confirm that you are able to do so, even if that is just a couple hours on a Friday afternoon.
Most jobs encourage community contributions, especially if it's closely linked to work related skills and projects.
However, this may not always be the case.

Volunteering needs to be beneficial to all affected parties, so being clear about the requirements and benefits of volunteering is important.


[TIP]
=====
How much ever time you can put aside for volunteering is fine.
There's no right amount, and the amount should change depending on your circumstances.
=====

A commitment requires putting aside some time to work on things.
Some volunteers may spend four hours a week, while others may spend more than fifteen hours a week contributing.
There's really no right amount.
We don't compete with each other to do more, nor do we feel bad if we cannot put in as much time as a fellow community member.
For most volunteers with jobs, volunteering ten or more hours a week is very difficult to maintain.
So, whatever you do, how much ever you can manage is fine.

TIP: Avoid over-committing: underestimate the time you have, and overestimate the time a task will take.

The general rule is to start small, to underestimate how much time you have, and to overestimate how much time it'll take you to do a particular task.
So, maybe start with a few hours a week, and depending on your circumstances, you may find that you can commit more time later.
But, maybe in the future you are busier and have to reduce your commitment.
This is also perfectly OK.
Just because you are able to do a certain amount of hours now does not mean you will also be able to do it next month.

TIP: Read link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/dont-lick-cookie[this very useful post on "cookie-licking"].


TIP: Get to know the community members, teams, and how they work before jumping into "doing tasks".

A common mistake most new contributors make is showing up "just wanting to contribute."
That's not how communities work.
Unlike jobs, there are no managers here.
We don't assign tasks to each other.
Yes, there are people who have been around longer and may know more, but we're still all friends and equals.

So, before jumping in to tasks, it is important to get to know the people.

* Take time to observe how teams work (refer to the section below).
* See how their work aligns with your own skills and personality.

// TODO: can this be worded better, in a more positive way?
TIP: It takes time for people to get to know each other, and trust each other to be able to share duties.

Understand that even highly skilled folks have to take the time learn how teams and pipelines/environments are structured before they can do any work.
Some teams have formal sponsorship requirements that must be met before the necessary access is granted to new members.
Others do not, and rely on team members knowing each other and each others' strengths and weaknesses to distribute tasks.

In general, it is a question of trust.
Would you give someone you've only known for a day access to your computer, your database, your work?
No?
The community wouldn't either, especially for security sensitive resources like our infrastructure.

The good news is that building trust in the Fedora community is easy.
Talk to people, participate in discussions and work, and before you know it, you will be a trusted community member.

The link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Welcome-to-Fedora[Welcome to Fedora] process that the Join SIG has in place is based on this line of thought.
We don't want you to jump into tasks.
We want you to get to know the people first, and then gradually start working on tasks.


TIP: Monitor and participate in meetings and general team communication to learn what/how/where/who/what/when they do things.

It is important to get to know the organization and teams you are looking to work with before you try to join them.
Learn what they do and how they do it, and try to get to know the people involved.

TIP: Be patient. It can take a few weeks to understand how things work.

Don't be shy about asking questions and getting to know people.
Plan on spending some time attending meetings, participating in the discussion forums/mailing lists and hanging out on the Matrix channels before taking on tasks.
This could take a few weeks, so be patient.

TIP: Be positive, even when critiquing. Always be excellent to others and follow the xref:project::code-of-conduct.adoc[Code of Conduct].

Offer suggestions on topics being discussed, and share any experiences (good or bad) you've had that is relevant to the discussion.
But do note that part of observing and making constructive suggestions may require withholding judgment.
When making suggestions, don't assume you come with all of the answers or that the Fedora Project is "doing it all wrong".
There is a good chance we can improve the way we are doing things, however most of our current practices were developed over long periods of time after lengthy discussion.
Your criticism may be better received once you have established yourself in the community and are perceived as understanding our culture.

A good way of providing feedback is to use "plussing".
The fundamental idea is to not just provide a critique or feedback for an idea, but to also offer suggestions or alternative solutions with that feedback.



TIP: In Fedora, you must decide what you want to work on yourself.

In Fedora, you decide what you want to work on.
We do not assign each other tasks and duties.

Teams usually have lists of tasks to do.
As you get to know a team better, you will be aware of what needs to be done.
Pick something that's important to you and something you have passion for.
Also, ask questions and understand what you're taking on before volunteering to do it.

There's always something to be done.
If you see something not quite right, something that can be improved, do your research and present a proposal to the team.
Seek work out, take the initiative, keep yourself busy and help others.


TIP: Start small. The key is slow, steady, sustainable growth.

When picking something to work on, don't be the sole person to take on a huge task as your first contribution.
Picking a task that's too large significantly raises the chances of failure.
Also don't pick several things on several teams to work on.
Start small, picking at most one or two things, and grow from there.
The key is slow, steady, and sustainable growth.
Don't join with the immediate goal of becoming the next leader of the project :).


TIP: Use public communication channels unless it is absolutely necessary to use private communication.

As a rule, unless personal information is involved, always always use public communication channels.
As noted in link:https://www.scrye.com/wordpress/nirik/2013/02/12/default-to-open-please/[this informative post], this has many advantages:

* You can get an answer faster from a group of people than just one person.
* You can get peer review of that answer from the group, where you wouldn't by just talking to one person.
* You can increase the knowledge of the community, instead of hiding it away. Perhaps 5 other people had the same question you just asked and got answered.
* You can start discussions and end up with a much better solution than the one person you were trying to talk to would have given you.
* Your question or comment could lead others in related questions or comments.

TIP: Open communication is key in the Fedora community.

So, for example:

* Default to sending to a list when you are replying to something asked there.
* Default to asking in a public channel (Matrix/IRC) instead of sending someone a private message
* Default to filing a ticket when you wish something done instead of sending private email.
* Default to replying on a Bugzilla bug instead of sending private emails.


TIP: Knowledge is maintained by the whole community, not individuals.

In a volunteer based community like Fedora, knowledge is shared and maintained collectively by the whole community.
We rarely mentor each other on a one to one basis.
Some teams may have sponsorship models in place where another community member may be responsible for another's initial contributions.
In general though, we all mentor each other.
That way, there is no single point of contact/failure.
So, if you see someone doing something you'd like to learn, go ahead and ask them to help you learn it.
On the other hand, if you know there's a better/easier way of doing something, document it somewhere and share it with the community.

TIP: Reading documentation is an important skill.

Another thing to keep in mind is that learning in volunteer communities usually happens by self-teaching.
People will always be happy to provide others with links and resources.
However, since we're all volunteers, it is difficult to make time to explicitly teach others.
So, a good habit is to ask people for documentation and references so you can learn yourself.
Reading documentation (and so maintaining up to date documentation) is an important skill.
Of course, if you have queries, ask and people will answer.


TIP: It's OK to say that you cannot do something you had taken up.

If you've found you've over-committed or decide volunteering isn't for you, that's OK.
You don't need to be embarrassed that you can't contribute further.
Contributors will not make you feel bad about it either.
Realize that lots of contributors come and go every day.
Being busy with your day job or not having enough free time is a perfectly valid reason for not being able to contribute.
It's even possible that you might not feel a good fit with the team or organization.
You're entitled to offer help as a volunteer how you want and when you want.

TIP: Let the community know that you are taking a break or leaving.

However, if at all possible, please don't just vanish without informing the community.
As friends, people in the community worry about each other, about our health and well being.
Additionally, when a contributor or potential contributor agrees to do certain work, is unable to follow through for any reason, and quietly vanishes, the community will not know that the work can be reassigned.

When you've decided it's time for you to go or take a break, let the community know.
Inform them of what tasks you had taken up and that they are now free for others to work on.

If/when you're able to return, let people know too.
We're always happy for people to take breaks and return to us.
