Become a member of Fedora l10n/translation community by following these steps.

[[fedora-account]]

Many Fedora community applications and tools, Fedora translation platform included, rely on xref:fedora-accounts::index.adoc[Fedora Accounts] for authentication and authorization of contributors.
Create such account by going to the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[home page] of Fedora Accounts and choosing the register tab.

A further prerequisite to contributing is a signature of the {FWIKI}/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement], see the tab Agreements in the Settings of your Fedora Account.

This is not a mandatory step, but it could be helpful to apply for a membership in https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/l10n/[l10n FA group] through the sponsorship (see xref:fedora-accounts::user.adoc#join-group[How do I become a member of a group?]).

[[ml]]

We use a public mailing list, open to all subscribers, for longer discussions (_asynchronous_ and sometimes multi-threaded communication) for which short live chats may not be enough.
Log into the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/[Fedora mailing lists] site using your Fedora Account credentials.
Then, find the {TRANSML}[Fedora Translation Project mailing list] and subscribe using your personal email address.
(A `@fedoraproject.org` alias can be also used, for more information see {FWIKI}/EmailAliases[e-mail aliases].)

News, updates, and discussion about translations, team coordination, etc. are shared through on the mailing list.
It is a *key part* to how we communicate.
It is usually a low traffic list.

[[introduction]]

Say hello and introduce yourself to the team!
Post a self-introduction to the mailing list and tell us a little about yourself.

Not sure what to say?
Answer these questions to start:

* Why are you interested in contributing to Fedora?
* Why are you interested in contributing to Translations?
* What is your native language?
Do you know other languages?
* If you're involved with other things in Fedora, what are/were you working on?
* Do you have any experience in open source or online communities?
If so, what?
* What parts of the L10n/G11n/Translation project are interesting to you?
* Do you have any questions for us?
How can we help _you_ get started?

[[chat-irc]]

Fedora uses https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Chat] powered by https://matrix.org[Matrix]/link:https://element.io[Element] and the https://libera.chat[Libera Chat IRC network] for instant messaging and _synchronous_ communication.

Short discussions and planning happen in the {CHAT}[*#l10n:fedoraproject.org*] matrix room in https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Chat], which is bridged with the *#fedora-l10n* channel on https://libera.chat[Libera.Chat], so people in Fedora Chat are able to seamlessly chat with people in Libera.Chat and vice versa.
If you want to stay connected even when you are not online, Fedora Chat can be a solution for you. But IRC clients offer a solution for staying connected permanently as well.
Simply, use what serves your instant messaging needs the best.

More information on Matrix, Element and/or IRC can be found in the https://fedoramagazine.org[Fedora Magazine] by searching _matrix_ or _irc_, for example.

[[weblate]]

{WEBLATE}[Weblate] is the online translation platform used by the Fedora Community.

Just log in at the {WEBLATE}accounts/login[login page] with your Fedora Account credentials, registration is not required as it is substituted by the Fedora Accounts.

NOTE: If you find wiki pages, documents and articles talking about Zanata, take into account that they could be https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-localization-platform-migrates-to-weblate/[outdated].

[[start-task]]

Just log in to {WEBLATE}[Weblate] and start translating! A short introduction to working with {WEBLATE}[Weblate] is available xref:weblate.adoc[here].

[[further-steps]]

Useful and deep information for newcoming contributors to Fedora, that we recommend to your attention, can be found on the page of xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[Fedora Join Special Interest Group].

A community is a group of people. Working alone is not always too funny.
Look for other people in your region and of your own language, join a language team if it is active, or think to kick off a new one.

NOTE: What you can find on the Fedora Wiki about the translation teams it is not always up to date.

:experimental:

This page describes in basic (ie. non-exhaustive) manner how to use and translate on the contemporary translation platform used by the Fedora Localization team.
The platform is a specific Weblate's instance, which is located on https://translate.fedoraproject.org.


Weblate is a web based translation tool with tight version control integration.
It features a simple and clean user interface, propagation of translations across components, quality checks and automatic linking to source files.

More information about Weblate (upstream project) can be found on https://weblate.org.

NOTE: Fedora's translation platform is an instance of an upstream  Weblate project's software run on translate.fedoraproject.org.
The instance is tailored to some specific needs of the Fedora Project.
To distinguish the instance from the upstream project further down this document, the notion _Weblate_ means the Fedora's {WEBLATE}[Weblate] instance, whereas _Weblate software_ denotes the upstream project.


A user must be logged in to Weblate in order to translate.
Weblate access is tightly coupled with https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts[Fedora Accounts], as a consequence, it cannot be accessed without a Fedora Account ID (your username).
How to create such account please see xref:join.adoc#fedora-account[Create a Fedora Account].

Once you have the ID, you can click the btn:[Login] to access Weblate and begin your contribution.

image:Weblate_Login-Register.png[]

image:Login_redirect_fas.png[]


After you've logged in successfully, you can find the project you want to translate by clicking btn:[Projects] link on top of the page.
There is a btn:[Watching] button on right side of the page of each project. You can simply click that button to add the project to your watching list.
When you login again next time, it will appear in your _Dashboard/Watched Translations_. So you can click the btn:[Translate] button next to the project to begin your translation without having to navigate the project first.

image:Add_to_watchlist.png[]

=== Online Translation ===

There are two available modes for translators when they translate using the Weblate online editor: _Zen_ mode and _Full Editor_ mode (single string mode).
Single string mode contains only one string in the page, but provides very detailed information about the string.
On the other hand, in Zen mode, detailed information is hidden, multiple of strings are shown in the page instead, which helps the translator to move to the next string very quickly.
Switching between two modes is quite easy, just click btn:[Exit Zen] or btn:[Zen] on the top right of the page, it's located to the left of the preference icon.

* Zen Mode:

image:Weblate_editor_zen_mode.png[]

* Single String Mode:

image:Single_string_mode.png[]

Weblate features an advanced search function, which makes the string filtering easier.
The btn:[Search] button is located at the top left of the editor, below the project navigation.
Furthermore, a search can also be done through the project overview page.

image:Project_search.png[]

For further information about using Weblate software, please visit the official https://docs.weblate.org[Weblate Documentation].

// This could have it's own page in the future

Our primary aim for this subchapter is to provide some useful and quick information you may seek, particularly when you have just begun translating for Fedora.
It is inspired by questions received from within our community members and preserved in the "`question-and-answer`" style.

Should you wish to see other question answered here, please xref:index.adoc#find-l10n[let us know].

// Question 1
How to start translating a project in Weblate to my language? Why I can't find my language on the list?::
When you visit a project to translate in Weblate (fig. 1) and enter one of it's components, you are presented with a list of languages (fig. 2) that doesn't have to contain all languages set and available for translation in Weblate.
The list contains languages only for which a translation of a given project/component was created.
+
--
.A project with its translation components
image::Weblate_project_components_list.png[]

.A component with languages listed
image::Weblate_project_component_languages.png[]

Provided you have set a `_translated language_` in your profile setings, your language translation can be added, strictly speaking, created by clicking on the btn:[+] sign next to your language on the list (fig. 3).
If such option is not available to you, you can click btn:[Start new translation] button in the end of the list and subsequently choose your language from the list of all langauges available in Weblate (fig. 4)(fig. 5).

.Start new translation page
image::Weblate_project_start_newtrans.png[]

.Dropdown list with all available languages
image::Weblate_project_start_newtrans_langlist.png[]

If you still cannot find your language and you expect 3 letter code, please note Weblate prefers https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/languages.html#language-code[two letter codes].
If you are not able to find your language even after that, https://pagure.io/fedora-l10n/tickets[file a ticket].
--

// Question 2
I want to translate Fedora Documentation, what docs should I start with?::
Try to start with the translation of the Fedora Docs https://docs.fedoraproject.org[homepage].
https://translate.fedoraprroject.org/projects/fedora-docs-l10n-docs/masterpagesindex is the relevant translation project in Weblate.
+
--
Go through https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/[Quick Docs], our the most used documentation, and see if you can pick an article that suits your particular interest.
Quick Docs translation project in Weblate: https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/fedora-docs-l10n-quick-docs/.

Last but not least, why not translate the documentation of your Fedora edition?
--

// Question 3
Should I translate the text I find enclosed in curly brackets in the fedora-websites-3.0 project?::
No, it is not translatable and the text should be left unchanged.
+
--
The curly brackets in the https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/fedora-websites-3-0/[fedora-website-3.0] translation project are used to distinguish names of (HTML) templates.
A template's content(s) is inserted (interpolated) during the website build process.
Related text interpolation facilitates localization since it enables a combination of the content (text) of different HTML elements together, names of the templates in translation strings in turn preserves better the text context for translators.
Be assured that you will be able to translate the content of a template (text which substitutes the template) too, but in another translation string.

Let a text of the first numbered indent from the verification modal dialog (see fig. 6 below) which can be opened from a download page of the website serve us as an example:

`Download the checksum file and signature into the same directory as the image you downloaded.`

.Example of curly brackets translation - original
image::Website_translation_curlybrackets_example_en.png[]

This sentence is a combination of an ordinary text and two web links - _checksum file_ and _signature_. For the purpose of its correct translation, you are supposed to translate three translation strings.

.string 1
....
Download the {checksum_file} and {signature} into the same directory as the image you downloaded.
....

In this string you translate everything except `&#123;checksum_file&#125;` and `&#123;signature&#125;`, which should be retained unchanged (as these 'words' are actually the names of templates).
They can be placed anywhere in your translation sentence, even their order of appereance, if appropriate, can be exchanged (`&#123;signature&#125;` might come first, `&#123;checksum_file&#125;` second).

.string 2 and 3
....
cheksum file
signature
....

How you translate these two strings, they will appear exactly in the sentence after the website is built.
The following table shows an example of translation of the three strings to the Czech language:

.Example comparison of string translations
[cols="1,3,3,3"]
|===
| |English (original) |Czech (translated) |String key

|string 1
|Download the &#123;checksum_file&#125; and &#123;signature&#125; into the same directory as the image you downloaded.
|Stáhněte si &#123;checksum_file&#125; a &#123;signature&#125; do stejného adresáře, kam jste stáhli obraz.
|download_the_checksum_and_signature

|string 2
|checksum file
|soubor kontrolního součtu
|checksum file

|string 3
|signature
|podpis
|signature
|===

NOTE: Keys of both string 2 and 3 - `checksum file` and `signature` - correspond with the templates' names.

Strings 2 and 3 substitute the templates `&#123;checksum_file&#125;` and `&#123;signature&#125;` in the string 1. So these three strings  will be combined together into the resulting sentence. Moreover, the translated version works the same, as can be seen on the below image.

.Example of curly brackets translation - translated
image::Website_translation_curlybrackets_example_cs.png[]

If templates and the text interpolation were not used, it would be needed to translate five translation strings to build the sentence:

....
1. Download the
2. checksum file
3. and
4. signature
5. into the same directory as the image you downloaded.
....

Imagine the strings in Weblate were not placed any near each other, then the text context for successful translation would be very limited, if not lost completely.

CAUTION: If you attempted to translate the template names (curly brackets) in string 1 directly, the template substitution and consequently text/translation interpolation on the website would be broken.

Transtats is a web application which tries to tie up upstream repositories, translation platforms, build system, and product release schedule together to solve problems of mismatch, out-of-sync conditions and to assist the timely packaging of quality translations. Actually, it collects translation data, analyzes them, and creates meaningful representations.

Fedora Transtats is hosted at https://transtats.fedoraproject.org

image:transtats-landing.png[]



Just select Packages tab from left hand side navigation bar. This takes us to the packages list view. Then, search for the package and click on its name. For example anaconda.

image:anaconda-pkg.png[]

We can reach here from https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/anaconda as well.

On package details page, locate following:

image:anaconda-details.png[]

Languages in red color indicate that there are translated strings remaining in the Translation Platform to be pulled and packaged, whereas, yellow denote translated messages could not make 100% in the built package.

image:anaconda-stats.png[]

Here, we have translation statistics from translation platform: Weblate and Koji build system. Syncs with the platform and build system are scheduled, which update differences periodically.


image:transtats-login.png[]

image:transtats-new-package.png[]

NOTE: Package name should match the project name on https://translate.fedoraproject.org.


Use Languages tab to list all the supported languages. Click on any of the languages, say, German. This takes us to the translation status page.

image:german-stats.png[]

We can navigate further into details to estimate the translation work for a release.


Click on any of the territories from the map, say India. This shows high level statistics.

image:territory-stats.png[]


Coverage rules can be created for a set of packages for specific details around string differences.

image:coverage-report.png[]

Transtats exposes an array of REST end points. See https://transtats.fedoraproject.org/api-docs/

This document outlines how the localization workflow works for the Fedora Documentation Website.


The localization process of the documentation works in three steps:

- Extract strings from the English sources and produce POT files.
- Translators translate these POT files and produce PO files.
- We consume these PO files to construct translated sources, and finally to build the translated website.

Step 1 and 3 is handled by the <<_core_scripts, localization pipeline scripts>>.
Step 2 take place in Weblate.


Localization pipeline scripts are hosted on Pagure in the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/translations-scripts[translation-scripts] repository.
This set of scripts run everyday at 21h UTC on our Openshift cluster.

The main script _build.py_ extracts all strings from adoc files in all components, create POT files, then use translated PO files to generate translated adoc files that will be used to build the final documentation website.

Translated adoc files are stored in the link:https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/translated-sources/[translated sources] repository.

.Fedora Documentation localization build pipeline
image::Fedora_docs_build_pipeline.png[A schema of how localization of Fedora Documentation is organized]

Documentation content is divided into components (spaces with their own navigation menu). +
Each component can have multiple versions, and also multiple modules.

The primary function of modules is the ability to store different parts of components in different git repositories. But they can be also stored in a single repository. +
One repository can even hold multiple components. And moving components or modules between repositories have no influence on the output.

This is also valid for translations, moving components around should not change the content for translators. +
That's why we need to organize the PO and POT wiles not according to repositories, but according to the components, modules, and versions.

.Standard Antora repository structure
[listing#ex-standard-dirs-root]
----
📒 repository <.>
📄 antora.yml <.>
📂 modules <.>
📂 ROOT <.>
📁 attachments <.>
📁 examples <.>
📁 images <.>
📁 pages <.>
📁 partials <.>
📄 nav.adoc <.>
📂 named-module <.>
📁 pages
📄 nav.adoc
📁 packages <.>
----
<.> The repository name has no influence on the documentation & translation output.
By default, Antora assumes the documentation content source is at the root of a repository unless the `start_path` or `start_paths` is defined in the link:https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/docs-website/docs-fp-o/-/blob/prod/site.yml[Fedora Doc's playbook].
<.> A component version descriptor file, named [.path]_antora.yml_, is required at each content source root.
<.> Required directory named [.path]_modules_.
A [.path]_modules_ directory must contain, at a minimum, either a _ROOT_ module directory or a named module directory.
<.> Optional _ROOT_ module directory.
A module directory must contain at least one family directory.
<.> Optional _attachments_ family directory.
<.> Optional _examples_ family directory.
<.> Optional _images_ family directory.
<.> Optional _pages_ family directory.
<.> Optional _partials_ family directory.
<.> Optional navigation file named [.path]_nav.adoc_.
<.> Optional named module directory.
<.> Antora won't process the files in this directory because it's located outside the [.path]_modules_ directory.


Translations are stored in dedicated repositories in the link:https://pagure.io/projects/fedora-docs-l10n/%2A[fedora-docs-l10n] Pagure namespace. +
Each repository uses the following structure:

.Standard translation repository structure
[listing#ex-translation-dirs-root]

📒 component-module <.>
📂 pot <.>
📁 version <.>
📄 page.pot
📁 po <.>

----
<.> The repository name is _<component_name>-<module_name>_, or just _<component_name>_ for the _ROOT_ module.
<.> _pot_ directory contain the source translation files used to start new translations.
<.> The version directory is named from the _version_ key in the component _antora.yml_. If not defined, it will be named _master_.
<.> _po_ directory contain translations that come directly from Weblate.
<.> The language-code directory is named using codes as defined by ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 when required. (ie.: _de_, _pt_BR_ or _zh_Hans_).

CAUTION: Renaming components or modules results in the loss of translations for that component and/or module.

IMPORTANT: While the content of those repositories is automatically generated by the localization pipeline and Weblate, each repository must first be created manually.

Information for project owners if they assess or intend to use the Fedora Project's online translation platform (based on the Weblate software project) for translating their project.
How to access the platform or request creation of a translation project, why the Fedora Localization Team believes it is worthwhile to offer it to a wider range of projects than solely those of the Fedora Project itself, and handful gathered practical advice for administering the translation project.



The Fedora Project runs a web-based online translation platform powered by https://weblate.org[Weblate software].
This Fedora {WEBLATE}[Weblate instance] is available at {WEBLATE} and is used by Fedora translators for translating Fedora subprojects, be it a software development project, a website or the documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not only Fedora subprojects are hosted though.
Examples of free and open source projects which can be found on Fedora Weblate translation platform and comes rather outside of Fedora:

. https://guix.gnu.org[Guix]
. https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/[Plymouth]
====



*Any free and open source software project is welcome to use this platform.*
Not only is it in line with the Fedora Project's vision of a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities, but also we considered there is more motivation behind this approach, such as:

* To provide a support to any project sharing the *same xref:project:ROOT:index.adoc[values]* as the Fedora Project
* To improve upstream i18n support
* A potential source of growth in the Fedora Community itself

As the Fedora l10n Team, we believe we are enough _"mature and consistent with our values to be ready to welcome projects which have different technical choices from those the Fedora implements"_ (Jean-Baptiste Holcroft, a member of the Fedora L10N Team, 2020).


////
Here could go what a project can expect from us
and on the other hand what they should be ready for

What makes us different with https://hosted.weblate.org?

We are a structured community sharing open-source values with
experienced translators
* Structured community: we have language teams https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/L10N_Teams and a global {TRANSML}[translator
mailing list]
* we have open-source values: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_freedom

Rule examples:
* announce translation readiness to translators one week before release?
* include translators in credits
* allow translation of website and man-pages
////



In spite of the effort to be open and inclusive as much as possible, some associated concerns has led us to enforce it is not possible to create a translation project in the platform by everyone:

* A translation of an (open source) project has to be ensured - _not what an individual has decided to translate._
* A project does not have to learn the weblate internals
* Configuring Weblate is not so obvious - _preferable is to do the first configuration for a project by us to reduce e.g. the migration costs._

In order to request an establishment of a new translation project in {weblate}[Weblate], open a link:https://pagure.io/fedora-l10n/tickets[ticket].

// Do we want to prepare a 'request template'?
.Project request with example values in italics
|===
| Project: | _debbuild_ |
| Website: | _https://github.com/debbuild/debbuild_ |
| Repository: | _https://github.com/debbuild/debbuild_ |
| Name of the development branch: |   |
| Filemask: | _po/*_ |
| Username: | _ngompa_ |
| Optional: ||
| Any announcement/warning you would like to display to the translators? (it will be displayed in Weblate): ||
| A need to activate any specific checks? (this is a setting per component): ||
| A need to automatically detect new translation files? (typical usecase: website translation with one translation file per page): ||
|===

// These features has already been implemented in Weblate
////
two features in Weblate to respect Fedora values:
- set a lincence in every component
- licence change should trigger a notification
////
// Should be a licence a part of the template?
// [optional] what is the license of translation? (please use a code from https://spdx.org/licenses/)
// Should we emphasize that a licence change will be notified

The specified username(s) will be set in the initial configuration of the project in Weblate as the project's administrator(s), subsequently notified about the project creation.

Request made by upstream projects will be reviewed on an individual basis upon submission of the ticket.
Priority will be given to projects that create software packaged for Fedora.



Once the requested translation project is created for you in Weblate, you can continue with https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/projects.html[setting] its other options.
There are several approaches to creating a project's components, for example.
Weblate provides different means to recieve and send changes between Weblate and your repository, so it is hard task to cover all possibilies here or prepare a common guide.
But what we have learned from helping to set various projects:

// webhooks
Do not forget to set, if appropriate, a https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/api.html#notification-hooks[webhook] in the project options in order to automatically receive changes from your VCS, such as

----
https://translate.fedoraproject.org/hooks/pagure  //for Pagure
https://translate.fedoraproject.org/hooks/gitlab  //for GitLab
https://translate.fedoraproject.org/hooks/github  //for GitHub
----

// repository push URL
Weblate is able to https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/continuous.html#pushing-changes-from-weblate[push translations] to your repository by setting 'Repository push URL' option of a component configuration.
For GitHub there is https://github.com/weblate[Weblate user] which should be given a commit access to the repository.
The same applies for GitLab.
For Pagure there is https://pagure.io/user/weblatebot[weblatebot user].

// pleaceholders flag
Weblate provides a wide range of quality checks on strings.
A `placeholders` flag can be set to add a quality check on texts from source string that must not be missing in the translation.
If missing, a warning will pop up to the translator.
Besides being extracted from the translation file, placeholders can be added manually by project administrators on a *per-component* or *per-string* basis, but not project-wide.

To set placeholders for a component:

. Go to the component page (e.g. https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/dnf5/dnf5/[dnf5 translation component] of the https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf5/[DNF5] project)
. Use the menu menu:Manage[Settings]
. On the menu:Settings[] page, go to btn:[Translation] tab
. Scroll until you see btn:[Translation flags] field
. Write the `placeholders` flag expression in there
+
--
====
For example: `placeholders:{}:{0}:{1}:{2}`
====

Such placeholders might be good for whole component as these terms might come up very often, like in a translation string _Failed to cleanup repository cache in path "{0}": {1}_.
--

To set a placeholders for a specific string (which will override its component's placeholders):

. When editing a string, go to the right-side sidebar and find btn:[Flags] item
. Click on the pencil icon to edit the flags
. In the btn:[Translation flags] field, write the `placeholders` flag expression in there
+
--
====
For example: `placeholders:--alldeps:--resolve`
====

These command-line options might be very good per-string placeholders if there isn't much of their occurence in the given component, like in a translation string _Option "--alldeps" should be used with "--resolve"_.
--

* https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/checks.html#placeholders[Syntax on placeholders]
* https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/checks.html#custom-checks[Customizing behavior using flags]
