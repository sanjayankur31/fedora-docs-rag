Welcome to the NeuroFedora documentation.
NeuroFedora is a link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/orgchart/[Fedora community special interest group (SIG)] that aims to make it easy for you to use Fedora Linux based link:https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software[Free/Open source software] platforms for neuroscience.

We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.

The NeuroFedora community makes more than 200 FOSS software tools easily installable on the Fedora Linux operating system and its derivative platforms.
We also provide a ready to use Fedora Linux based operating system that comes pre-installed with many tools for computational neuroscience.
Please use the links in the sidebar to learn more about NeuroFedora and the artefacts we produce.

NeuroFedora in its current form link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VXN4UBCNIL6BUCDRN55IGVK3IMO3HF6C/[was started on September 30, 2018].


We are always looking for more volunteers to help us do more.
The various contributor roles that we currently have set up can be found in the xref:contributing.adoc[contributor documentation].
You can even create a new role for yourself!
Our volunteers generally work a few hours a week on NeuroFedora.



You can learn more about the Free Software movement link:https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/[on their website].
You can learn more about the use of link:http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/[Open source for Neuroscience here].
Other relevant neuroscience links are collected on a xref:related-links.adoc[separate page].


The Fedora community produces a number of Fedora Linux based operating systems for different use-cases, including one for computational neuroscience.


For laptops and workstations, a number of Fedora Linux variants with different link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment[desktop environments] (user interfaces) are available.

The child friendly Fedora Linux platform with the link:https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/soas/[Sugar on a stick] learning platform is also available.


A number of other customised Fedora Linux OS platforms are also available from https://labs.fedoraproject.org/.
These include operatings sytems for link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific[scientific computing], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/robotics[robotics], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/security[security], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/python-classroom[teaching Python], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/jam[music production], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/games[gaming], link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/design-suite[design and multimedia], and link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/astronomy[astronomy].


A number of Fedora Linux products with immutable operating systems are also available.
In these variants, unlike traditional platforms where the operating system consists of multiple pieces of software that can all be modified independently, the operating system is a single unit where all components are updated together.
User applications and containers are kept separate from the host system.
These features are intended to make the system more stable and reliable.

These platforms are excellent for containerized applications and container based development workflows.

NeuroFedora is a set of packages that can be installed on a Fedora system.
So, one can setup a Fedora system and then install whatever tools they use.
Fedora provides a variety of installation media:

* We suggest the link:https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/[Fedora workstation] as a well designed link:https://www.gnome.org/[GNOME] based installation.
* For headless (such as clusters and servers without a graphical interface) installations, we suggest the link:https://getfedora.org/en/server/[Fedora server] installation.
* Users that prefer other desktop environments, such as link:https://www.kde.org/[KDE], link:https://xfce.org/[XFCE], link:https://lxqt.org/about/[LXQT], link:https://mate-desktop.org/[Mate], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)[Cinnamon] or link:https://lxde.org/[LXDE], can select a link:https://spins.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora spin].
* The link:https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/[Fedora scientific] image provides a KDE based installation that includes various generally used scientific tools.

Detailed information on installing Fedora can be found in the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora documentation].


NOTE: More software is regularly being added to NeuroFedora. Please xref:communicating.adoc[get in touch with us] for specific requests.

Users have access to the xref:installing-software.adoc[complete set of software maintained by the Fedora community].
The NeuroFedora special interest group (SIG), however, focusses on providing software for:

* xref:compneuro-tools.adoc[computational neuroscience]
* xref:imaging-tools.adoc[neuro-imaging]
* xref:analysis-tools.adoc[data-analysis]
* xref:utilities.adoc[our digital goodie box of assorted tools]

Please use the individual pages to learn more.


Free/Open source software that is harder to include in Fedora (usually because it is developed in a way that makes it difficult to package while implementing the Fedora packaging guidelines) is temporarily provided in an xref:copr.adoc[extra COPR repository].
The NeuroFedora team will continue to work with upstreams to move it to official Fedora repositories.


Use of containers is discussed on a xref:containers.adoc[separate page].



The following tools are among the software currently tested in NeuroFedora and can be installed directly from upstream forges (e.g. PyPi).

Software that is in the queue for inclusion is listed link:https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?tags=F%3A+Neuroimaging[here].

Free/Open source software that is harder to include in Fedora (usually because it is developed in a way that makes it difficult to package while implementing the Fedora packaging guidelines) is temporarily provided in an link:https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/neurofedora/neurofedora-extra/[extra COPR repository].
The NeuroFedora team will continue to work with upstreams to move this software to official Fedora repositories.
In the meantime, users can enable this COPR repository by running the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf copr enable @neurofedora/neurofedora-extra
----

Once the COPR repository has been enabled, it acts like another Fedora repository.
Users can then continue to install software using DNF.

Software in COPR does not go through the usual Fedora QA channels.
However, the NeuroFedora team will thoroughly test this software before making it available.
The sources for building these packages can be found on link:https://pagure.io/projects/neuro-sig/%2A[Pagure].


Software that is is currently provided in the COPR is listed below:

Users can also use sanboxed applications using link:https://flatpak.org/[Flatpaks] on Fedora.
Please refer to link:https://flathub.org/home[Flathub] to see what software is available using Flatpaks.

Since the NeuroFedora packages are available in the Fedora repositories, they can also be used in customised containers using the Fedora base containers.
The Fedora community release container images for all Fedora releases which can be obtained from standard public container image registries like link:https://hub.docker.com/_/fedora[Docker Hub].

These containers can be used with link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker], or link:https://podman.io/[Podman].

Podman is a replacement for Docker that does not require administrative access.
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Docker in a majority of cases.
On a Fedora system, Podman can be installed using `dnf`.

[source,console]
----
sudo dnf install podman
----

To use Docker, please refer to the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/[Docker documentation].
Fedora also includes the link:https://github.com/containers/toolbox[Toolbox] software, which allows the use of containerised command line environments.
Toolbox can be installed using `dnf`:

[source,console]
----
sudo dnf install toolbox
----

You can learn more about it on the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/[Fedora Silverblue documentation page].


Even though the CompNeuro container image includes a plethora of tools for computational neuroscience, any package from the Fedora repositories can be used in a container by using the base Fedora release containers.
A simple example of using a Fedora container to use a NeuroFedora package is shown below.
Here, we use the Fedora base container image, install the required package, and test that it works.

First, we pull the base Fedora container image:
[source,console]
----
podman pull fedora:latest

While working interactively is quite useful, it is even more useful to create container images with specific sets of packages that can then be used and re-used regularly.
For reproducible research, for example, a container image that includes all the necessary software and sources for the model, its simulation, and the analysis of the generated data is most useful.

A container image can be created using a standard Containerfile (Dockerfile for Docker).
The complete reference for the Containerfile/Dockerfile can be found link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[here].

Let us create an example container that runs this short code-snippet.

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# example Python source file
# saved in the current directory as nest-test.py
import nest

nest.version()
----


Our simple Containerfile looks like this:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM fedora:33 as fedora-33

# Install the required packages, in this case: NEST
RUN sudo dnf install python3-nest -y

COPY nest-test.py .

# Default command to run
CMD ["python", "nest-test.py"]
----


We can then build our container image:

[source,console]
----
ls
Containerfile  nest-test.py

podman build -f Containerfile  -t neurofedora/nest-test

STEP 1: FROM fedora:33 AS fedora-33
STEP 2: RUN sudo dnf install python3-nest -y
Fedora 33 openh264 (From Cisco) - x86_64        1.9 kB/s | 2.5 kB     00:01
....
Complete!
--> 2efea29a8db
STEP 3: COPY nest-test.py .
--> b23a5c6f90d
STEP 4: CMD ["python3", "nest-test.py"]
STEP 5: COMMIT neurofedora/nest-test
--> da9240e572b
da9240e572b4c08ac010001cbc15cb81ae879c63dca70afa4b3e6f313254b218
----

Our image is now ready to use:

[source,console]
----
$ podman image list
REPOSITORY                         TAG              IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
localhost/neurofedora/nest-test    latest           da9240e572b4  17 seconds ago  911 MB
----

When run, it runs our simple script:

[source,console]
----
$ podman run neurofedora/nest-test

In a similar way, any package from the Fedora repositories can be used in containers using `dnf` (not just NeuroFedora packages).
Additionally, we can also include software using `pip` and other package managers, just as we would on a normal system.

Where supported, software in NeuroFedora is also built with link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] support.
Fedora includes link:http://www.mpich.org/[MPICH] and link:https://www.open-mpi.org/[OpenMPI] implementations of link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI].
Software can be used with either of these, or without any link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] support (if a non link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] version is available).

Software built with link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] is provided as separate packages for each link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] implementation:

----
<software>-mpich
<software>-openmpi
----

These packages can be installed using link:https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html[DNF] in the same way as normal packages.

Binaries provided by the software, if any, will also be suffixed to clearly mark which implementation of link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] is in use:

----
<binary>_mpich
<binary>_mpi
----

For example, NEST is provided as:

----
nest-mpich
nest-openmpi
----

and the binaries in these are respectively named:

----
nest_mpich
nest_openmpi
----


To use an MPI build, the appropriate link:https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[environment module] must be loaded.
These correctly setup paths, and environment variables.
For MPICH builds:

[source,bash]
----
module load mpi/mpich-$arch # $arch is the architecture, for example x86_64
----

For OpenMPI builds:

[source,bash]
----
module load mpi/openmpi-$arch # $arch is the architecture, for example x86_64
----

The architecture can be obtained using the `uname` command in a terminal:

[source,bash]
----
uname -m
----

It is generally easier to add these lines to the `~/.bashrc` file (for bash users) so that these commands are automatically run on each login.

Where required, use of software with link:https://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] is documented on a separate page.
