* Fedora Licensing Guidelines
= License Approval

== Overview

In order to meet the goal of creating a complete, general purpose
operating system exclusively from free and open source software, all
software and other content made available by Fedora must be under
licenses determined to be allowed in Fedora, with only limited,
conditional exceptions.

Fedora applies different license approval criteria for different
categories of material: code, documentation, content, fonts, and
firmware. The corresponding status names for approved licenses are:
_allowed_, _allowed-documentation_, _allowed-content_,
_allowed-fonts_, and _allowed-firmware_. The strictest license
approval standards apply to code, while somewhat relaxed standards
apply to the other categories. Licenses that are not allowed for any
category are classified as _not-allowed_.

IMPORTANT: Fedora's license approval standards apply to everything
that is made available by the Fedora Project, not just installable
binary packages in Fedora Linux. For example, everything available at
https://pagure.io[Fedora Pagure], https://src.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Source Packages], https://koji.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Koji],
https://docs.fedoraproject.org[Fedora documentation] and
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr repositories] is subject to
the same licensing rules as Fedora Linux packages.

The Fedora legal documentation includes lists of
xref:allowed-licenses.adoc[allowed] and
xref:not-allowed-licenses.adoc[not-allowed] licenses for Fedora. These
lists are generated from the data maintained in the
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data[Fedora License
Data] repository. In case of any discrepancy between the generated Fedora license lists
and the data in Fedora License Data, the latter is considered
authoritative. For some purposes you may find it more useful to refer
to the repository (particularly the TOML files in the `data/`
directory), rather than the generated lists.

Fedora uses xref:spdx.adoc[SPDX license expressions] to
represent allowed and not-allowed licenses in TOML files in the Fedora
License Data `data/` directory and in the generated Fedora license
lists.

If a license that covers something in Fedora, or in a package that has
been or is intended to be proposed for inclusion in Fedora Linux, is
not listed on the allowed and not-allowed lists, then it must be
xref:license-review-process.adoc[reviewed].

Whether a license is allowed or not allowed for Fedora is ultimately
determined by the Fedora Council. Today, this decision is normally
delegated to members of the Red Hat legal team who are specialists in
free software / open source licensing and who are very familiar with
and committed to supporting Fedora's
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/[mission and
foundations].

== Allowed Licenses

A license is _allowed_ if Fedora determines that the license is a free
software / open source license. At a high level, the inquiry involves
determining whether the license provides software freedom, and
(equivalently) making sure that the license does not place burdens on
users' exercise of its permissions that are inconsistent with evolving
community norms and traditions around what is acceptable in a free
software / open source license.

As a general rule, all code made available by Fedora must be governed
by an _allowed_ license. A license that is in the general _allowed_
category can be used for anything in Fedora, not just code.

TIP: Fedora treats spec files as "code". Normally, spec files have no
explicit license, and, to the extent they were authored by Fedora
contributors and are copyrightable, they are available under the MIT license by virtue of the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/fpca/[FPCA].

== Licenses Allowed for Documentation

Fedora will designate a license as allowed for documentation
(_allowed-documentation_) if it meets the criteria for _allowed_
licenses and it seems to be specifically designed for documentation
and not for code.

In addition, Fedora classifies the following licenses as
_allowed-documentation_ (even though they do not meet the above
criteria):

* Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License and
its predecessor versions

* Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
License and its predecessor versions

* The GNU Free Documentation License version 2.1 and its predecessor
versions

== Licenses Allowed for Content

For purposes of Fedora license classification, “content” means any
material that is not clearly code, documentation, fonts or firmware.
Here are some examples of content:

* graphic image files
* audio files
* nonfunctional data sets
* AppStream metainfo.xml files
* standards documents
* certain files relating to functionality and management of markup languages,
including XML schema files and resource resolution files, XSL files, SGML declaration files,
and ancillary informal documentation accompanying such files
* checkpoints or comparable machine learning model files containing trained parameters
* non-script slide presentation resources, except to the extent slide presentation content functions as documentation
* game engine package files that contain game data

Fedora will designate a license as allowed for content
(_allowed-content_) if it meets the criteria for _allowed_ licenses
with the following exceptions:

* The license may restrict or prohibit modification
* The license may say that it does not cover patents or grant any patent licenses

TIP: When we say that a standards document is subject to the relaxed
license criteria for content, we are referring to the
copyright-oriented license for the document itself, not licenses
covering implementation of the technology specified by the document.

TIP: Man pages are considered documentation, not content, even when
they are derived from standards documents.

IMPORTANT: `CC0-1.0`, which has a clause that says that it does not license
or otherwise "affect" patent rights, is no longer _allowed_, but it
continues to be _allowed-content_.

Fedora's decision to treat a particular category of material as "content"
generally reflects a pragmatic judgment. The main focus for Fedora is free
software; in some cases, for free software to be fully useful, it must be
accompanied by non-software items that unfortunately are covered by non-libre
terms. Fedora may be more likely to conclude that a given category of material
is "content" if such material is (as a general matter) likely of doubtful or
"thin" copyrightability.

== Licenses Allowed for Fonts

Fedora may designate a license as allowed for fonts
(_allowed-fonts_) if it meets the criteria for _allowed_ licenses
with the following exception:

* The license may contain a nominal prohibition on resale or
distribution in isolation

In addition, Fedora classifies the following licenses as _allowed-fonts_ (even
though at least some of them do not meet the above criteria):

* Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License and its
predecessor versions

* Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License and
its predecessor versions

A good example of what we mean by a "nominal prohibition on resale or
distribution in isolation" is found in the following condition in the
https://spdx.org/licenses/OFL-1.1.html[SIL Open Font License 1.1]:

`Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in
Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.`

This kind of prohibition would not be acceptable in a license
applicable to code (see, for example, the
https://spot.livejournal.com/315383.html[Sun RPC license]).

NOTE: The prohibition in the SIL OFL is "nominal" because in FOSS
legal culture it has occasionally been cleverly asserted that one can
get around this kind of provision by bundling a trivial 'Hello world'
program with the fonts (and there is actually some reason to believe
the authors of the SIL OFL intended this). If we were to encounter a
license that had such a provision but we believed a 'Hello world'
solution was not even arguably viable, we might not consider the
license allowable for fonts.

== Licenses Allowed for Firmware

Some applications, drivers, and hardware require binary firmware
images to boot Fedora Linux or function properly. Fedora permits
inclusion of these files as long as they meet the following license
and technical requirements:

=== License requirements for firmware

Fedora may designate a license as allowed for firmware
(_allowed-firmware_) if it meets the criteria for _allowed_
licenses with the following exceptions:

* The license may prohibit modification, reverse engineering,
disassembly or decompilation.

* The license may require that the firmware be used only in
conjunction with specified hardware.

* The license may require that the firmware be redistributed only as
incorporated in the redistributor's product (or as a maintenance
update for existing end users of the redistributor's product). This
may be limited further to those products of the redistributor that
support or contain the hardware associated with the licensed
firmware.

* The license may require a redistributor to pass on or impose
conditions on users that are no more restrictive than those
authorized by Fedora itself with respect to firmware licenses.

=== Technical firmware requirements

While these technical requirements for firmware have nothing to do
with licensing, they are included here for convenience.

* The files must be non-executable within the Fedora Linux context
(note: this means that the files cannot run on their own, not that
they are just `+chmod -x+`)

* The files must not be libraries, within the Fedora Linux context

* The files must be standalone, not embedded in executable or library
code (within the Fedora Linux context)

* The files must be necessary for the functionality of open source
code being included in Fedora Linux or to enable Fedora Linux to
boot on a specific device, where no other reliable and supported
mechanisms exist

== 'Not allowed' Licenses

Any license that does not meet the criteria above for allowed licenses
(including allowed for a specific category) will be classified as
_not-allowed_.

NOTE: In extremely rare cases we may have some reason to designate a
license as _not-allowed_ even though it might meet the formal criteria
for the relevant category. An example is
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/data/LicenseRef-wrk.toml?ref_type=heads[`LicenseRef-wrk`],
which represents a license based on the Apache License 2.0 and named
"Modified Apache License 2.0", presumably without permission from the
Apache Software Foundation, which has said that derivatives of the
Apache License cannot have "Apache" in their name.

=== `usage` exceptions

For some _not-allowed_ licenses, or licenses allowed only for a
specific category, an exception is recorded in the Fedora License Data
TOML file for the license, as the value of the `usage` key (and
displayed in the "Usage" column of the
xref:not-allowed-licenses.adoc[not-allowed] list). The exception will
indicate that Fedora tolerates the license under limited conditions
(for example, for a specific package, or for a defined time period).

For example, here is the `usage` exception for `OPUBL-1.0`:

[example]
Allowed for documentation if the copyright holder does not
exercise any of the “LICENSE OPTIONS” listed in Section VI

NOTE: `OPUBL-1.0` represents the Open Publication License version 1.0,
which was classified as "good" for documentation under the Callaway
system provided no "options" are exercised. For administrative
convenience we now classify it as _not-allowed_ with the `usage`
exception noted above.

== Changes in License Status

Fedora aims for stability in its license classifications, but its
treatment of a particular license or license type may change as
community standards and expectations around acceptable licensing
evolve or as new issues and concerns come to light. In rare cases, an
allowed license may be reclassified as _not-allowed_, or an _allowed_
license may be reclassified as allowed only for a specific category of
material, as when `CC0-1.0` was reclassified from _allowed_ to
_allowed-content_. When this sort of reclassification is done, we
will try to minimize disruption, including by defining appropriate
`usage` exceptions.

== Background to Fedora licensing policy

Over several decades, norms concerning acceptable standards for
software (and other content) licensing developed out of communities
associated with free software and open source projects. Fedora builds
upon and contributes to the development of this community
tradition. Most of the philosophical and practical groundwork for
Fedora's policies on licensing was developed over many years by
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Spot[Tom 'spot' Callaway], often
working in collaboration with members of Red Hat's legal team.

The two most influential efforts to distill FOSS licensing norms are
the Free Software Foundation's maintenance and interpretation of the
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#fs-definition[Free
Software Definition], and the Open Source Initiative's maintenance and
interpretation of the https://opensource.org/osd[Open Source
Definition]. For much of its earlier history, Fedora tended to regard
the FSF's interpretation as highly authoritative, while viewing the
OSI's license review decisions with greater skepticism. However, even
at the high point of that period of skepticism, Fedora treated the OSD
and OSI decisions as one source of persuasive authority. Fedora has
also sometimes taken into account the decisions of other major
community Linux distributions and other important community efforts to
define and apply software freedom-related legal norms. Fedora's
license approval decisions are both principled and pragmatic.

Out of necessity, Fedora has passed judgment on hundreds of licenses
never considered by the FSF or the OSI. In a small number of cases,
Fedora has disagreed with decisions of the FSF and OSI regarding
whether particular licenses are FOSS. Over time, Fedora has built up
an informal body of interpretation and policymaking regarding
free/open licensing which has itself influenced the larger FOSS
community outside of Fedora.

= SPDX License Expressions

This page provides an introduction to SPDX license expressions with a
focus on how they are used in Fedora.

== Overview

https://spdx.dev[SPDX] (Software Package Data Exchange) is a standard
format for communicating the component and metadata information
associated with software packages. The three aspects of SPDX that are
most relevant to Fedora are:

* The https://spdx.org/licenses[SPDX License List]: Focusing on
commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free/open or
collaborative software, data and documentation, this list features
standardized short identifiers for referring to licenses and
exceptions.

* The
https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/spdx-license-expressions/[SPDX
license expression grammar].

* The
https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/[SPDX
matching guidelines]: Multiple real-world license texts will "match"
a given SPDX License List license or exception identifier in
accordance with these guidelines.

Fedora uses SPDX license expressions primarily for two distinct though
related purposes:

* To classify and organize the data pertaining to allowed and
not-allowed licenses, as maintained in the Fedora License Data
repository and the Fedora license lists that are generated from it.

* To populate License tags in spec files.

== Types of SPDX License Expressions

=== SPDX License List Identifiers

Commonly called "SPDX identifiers", these are the short form
identifiers contained in the SPDX License List. Examples: `MIT`,
`GPL-2.0-or-later`.

=== Custom-defined License Identifiers (`LicenseRef-`)

A custom-defined license identifier (i.e., not contained in the SPDX
License List) may be formed using the `LicenseRef-` prefix). Currently
in Fedora License Data all `LicenseRef-` identifiers are defined
specifically by Fedora (i.e., there is no use of `LicenseRef-`
identifiers from other projects or organizations). Note that SPDX
currently has no official system of namespacing for `LicenseRef-`
identifiers.

Most Fedora `LicenseRef-` identifiers represent _not-allowed_
licenses. Examples: `LicenseRef-sun-rpc`,
`LicenseRef-OpenMotif`. However, some represent allowed
licenses. Examples include the umbrella identifiers
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` and
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`.

=== `WITH` Expressions

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by following an SPDX
identifier with the `WITH` operator, followed by an exception
identifier contained in the
https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html[SPDX Exceptions
List]. This is intended to signify the supplementing of a license
grant with a permissive exception or additional permission, which most
commonly occurs with licenses in the GPL family. Some examples:
`GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic`, `Apache-2.0 WITH
LLVM-exception`.

In theory, `WITH` can also follow a `LicenseRef-` identifier, but
there are no examples of this in Fedora License Data. (There is one
unusual `LicenseRef-` that incorporates `WITH` in the identifier:
`LicenseRef-GPL-2.0-or-later-WITH-UPX`.) SPDX 3.0 added an
`AdditionRef-` construct to the SPDX expression grammar, which
permits custom-defined identifiers that can follow `WITH`. `WITH
AdditionRef-` expressions may be used for additional terms of all
types, not just permissive exceptions.

=== `OR` Expressions

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by joining two SPDX
expressions with the `OR` operator. This is intended to signify a
choice of licenses. In FOSS, a choice of exactly two licenses is often
called "dual licensing", although that term is sometimes used to refer
to different concepts. Examples: `Apache-2.0 OR MIT` (a common
form of licensing of Rust crates), `MPL-1.1 OR GPL-2.0-or-later OR
LGPL-2.1-or-later` (historically known as the Mozilla tri-license).

=== `AND` Expressions

A compound SPDX expression may be formed by joining two SPDX
expressions with the `AND` operator. This generally signifies that
both sub-expressions apply to different parts of a file or
package. Example: `LGPL-2.1-or-later AND GPL-2.0-or-later AND MIT`

=== `+` Operator

The postfix `+` operator applied to an SPDX identifier signifies
permission to use later versions of the license. Example:
`LPPL-1.3a+`. Use of `+` is uncommon in Fedora License Data.

NOTE: At the Free Software Foundation's request, the use of `+` with
GPL family license identifiers has been deprecated by SPDX in favor of
the use of `-only` and `-or-later` identifier variants (for example,
`GPL-2.0-only` and `GPL-2.0-or-later`).

== SPDX License Expressions in Fedora License Data

Each item in Fedora's lists of allowed and not-allowed licenses is an
SPDX license expression that is associated with a specific TOML file
in the `data/` directory of the Fedora License Data repository. Each
TOML file has an `expression` key whose value is a string containing
an SPDX license expression. That SPDX expression forms the base name
of the TOML file, except that internal whitespace is represented with
an underscore. For example, the `MIT.toml` file contains `expression =
"MIT"`, and the `GPL-2.0-only_WITH_Linux-syscall-note.toml` file
contains `expression = "GPL-2.0-only WITH Linux-syscall-note"`.

`AND` expressions and, with one exception, `OR` expressions, are not
appropriate for Fedora License Data. (They may, and commonly do,
appear in xref:license-field.adoc[spec file License
tags].)

The exception is certain `OR` expressions representing a dual license
that consists of a GPL-family license and the Perl 5 Artistic 1.0
license (~ `Artistic-1.0-Perl`). Currently two of these are included
in Fedora License Data: `GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl` and
`GPL-2.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`.

TIP: This exception is designed to facilitate the use of these `OR`
expressions in spec file License tags for Perl packages, a preference
of Fedora Perl package maintainers and upstream Perl module
maintainers despite the fact that `Artistic-1.0-Perl` is
_not-allowed_. The normal rule in Fedora is that if a license grant is
representable by an `OR` expression that includes an allowed license
and a license that is _not allowed_, only the allowed license should be
included in a spec file License tag.

== SPDX Matching Guidelines

SPDX License List identifiers are templates (specified in XML files
maintained in the
https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/tree/main/src[license-list-XML
repository]). Many of the XML files make use of regular expressions
and designate portions of license text as optional. Multiple
real-world license texts may _match_ an SPDX identifier in a sense
that is defined in detail in the
https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest/annexes/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/[matching
guidelines] contained in the SPDX specification. Not all of the
matching guidelines are implemented in the XML files.

In using SPDX identifiers and `LicenseRef-` identifiers, Fedora aims
to apply the SPDX matching guidelines to the extent they are
meaningful or applicable to the Fedora context.

== SPDX License Expressions in License Tags

A xref:license-field.adoc[separate page] provides a detailed
discussion of the use of SPDX expressions in spec file License tags.






= License Review Process

If you find a license that covers part of a Fedora package, a proposed
Fedora package, or some other Fedora Project artifact, that is not
listed in the xref:allowed-licenses.adoc[allowed] or
xref:not-allowed-licenses.adoc[not-allowed] license lists, please
submit the license for review. Licenses are classified as allowed, allowed for certain types of
material, or not allowed for inclusion in Fedora as discussed in
xref:license-approval.adoc[License Approval].

Fedora has adopted the
use of SPDX expressions along with the SPDX matching guidelines as a
standard system for representing and classifying licenses. In most cases where a license is classified as allowed, Fedora
prefers to use standard SPDX license identifiers (contained in the
SPDX License List) rather than custom-defined identifiers.

The license review process typically involves these three steps:

. Open a https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues[fedora-license-data issue] for review of a license.
. Open an https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues[SPDX license-list-XML] issue (usually to request addition of an identifier for the license to the SPDX License List). This step is not needed if the license matches to a license already on the SPDX License List or if the license is determined to be _not-allowed_.
. Once Fedora has decided how to classify the license, open a https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/merge_requests[merge request] to add a TOML file for the license at fedora-license-data.

The first step is typically initiated by a Fedora package maintainer,
although any Fedora contributor is encouraged to request review of a
license. We prefer that the person who initiates the first step also
takes responsibility for the second and third steps, as this reduces
the burden on the Fedora License Data maintainers and makes the
license review process more efficient.

Community software licenses that are apparently intended as jokes
(https://github.com/ErikMcClure/bad-licenses[examples]) are generally analyzed
as though they were serious.

== Opening a Fedora License Data license review issue

To request review of a license, you must be a Fedora contributor and
become part of the Fedora Gitlab group.

Open a
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/new[new
issue] for Fedora License Data using the license review issue
template. You should ordinarily create one issue per license, rather
than submit an issue referencing multiple licenses for review.

TIP: If you need general help with identifying the licenses that apply
to an entire package, we encourage you to submit an issue for this
purpose. We will apply the `package inquiry` label to such issues.

Title the issue `License Review: <identifying name>`. (The issue
template function in Gitlab does not provide for an automatic issue
title.) For the "identifying name", use an SPDX identifier, if
applicable and known. If the license is not on the SPDX License List,
then use an official or commonly applied license name or
a placeholder identifier. In any case, something unique and identifiable
makes it easier to track issues in the repository. The vast
majority of license review issues use a placeholder name. This is
usually not the identifier that ends up being used to represent the
license in Fedora License Data.

The license review issue template will ask you to provide the
following information:

* License name (required) -- you can use the "identifying name" that
you used in the issue title, or "None" if you prefer

* Text of license (required) -- please provide a link to the license
text or where it can be downloaded; also include the license
text in a comment after creating the issue (particularly if it is
relatively brief license)

* Fedora package name and link to upstream source code of the package
(required)

* Is the license (or an exception, if your issue is requesting review
of a `WITH` expression) on the https://spdx.org/licenses[SPDX
License List]? (required) -- if yes, then include the applicable
SPDX license expression

* Reason for the license review (optional) -- for example, a link to the Bugzilla ticket for the package review

All discussion related to the license review will occur in the issue
thread and an official decision, based on application of the Fedora
xref:license-approval.adoc[license approval criteria], will be noted
there. A decision may sometimes be noted solely by application of an
appropriate scoped label referring to the license classification.

=== How to determine if a license or exception is on the SPDX License List

The SPDX License List has an established set of https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/[guidelines] that define what constitutes a match to a https://spdx.org/licenses[license] or https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html[exception] on the SPDX License List. This is intended to ensure that SPDX license identifiers and expressions mean the same thing wherever they are used.

SPDX has some https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md[guidance] for how to detect and match license texts you find
to licenses on the SPDX License List.

You can also find information about various xref:license-audit-tools.adoc[license detection tools]
in this documentation.

== Opening an SPDX License List issue

If the Fedora License Data maintainers conclude that the license is
allowed, and they apply the `SPDX::submit issue` label, then the next
step is to
https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md[create
an issue for the SPDX license-list-XML repository]. In most cases, the
purpose of the issue is to request addition of a new license
identifier representing the license in the SPDX License List, but it may also
be to request a determination as to whether additional markup can be added
to an existing SPDX license to match to the license you found. You do not need to
determine this when you submit the issue.

TIP: If the license does not seem to match an identifier already on
the SPDX License List, you do not have to wait for a Fedora License
Data decision on the license before opening an SPDX issue. Usually,
however, an SPDX issue is not opened until the Fedora License Data
maintainers have decided the license is allowed for Fedora.

In addition to the required information, add a link to the
related Fedora License Data issue. If there has already been a Fedora
decision regarding the license please note that as well.

In some cases, the license you've found may not match an existing SPDX
license according to the SPDX matching guidelines, but it
will be sufficiently close that the SPDX legal team may determine that
your variant can be accommodated by revising the XML file for the
existing SPDX license in question. The Fedora License Data maintainers may
instruct you to create an SPDX License List issue for this purpose upon their review.

If SPDX approves the license for inclusion as an identifier on the
SPDX License List, please help create the SPDX files for your
submission in accordance with the
https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md#accepted-license-process[SPDX
license list process].

If you've submitted an SPDX issue before there is a decision on the
Fedora side, and the Fedora License Data maintainers later decide that
the license is _not-allowed_, you should offer to close the SPDX issue
if it is still pending.

TIP: For allowed licenses, we want to use SPDX identifiers to
represent the license, and to request a new SPDX identifier if an
applicable one does not exist. For _not-allowed_ licenses, we will use
an SPDX identifier to represent the license if it is already on the
SPDX License List, but otherwise we will create a
`LicenseRef-` identifier to ensure all license expressions in Fedora
are valid with the SPDX Specification.

The submission and approval process for inclusion on the SPDX License List can
be lengthy. As a temporary measure to mitigate delays in the workflow, the
Fedora Project will provision a temporary license identifier with the syntax
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Temporary-*` that you may use. Or
`AdditionRef-Fedora-Temporary-*` for exceptions. Once SPDX assigns the final ID,
you have to change this temporary ID to the final one.

== Opening a Fedora License Data merge request

Once (1) Fedora has made a decision to allow or not allow the license,
and (2) (if applicable) the SPDX License List process is also
complete, create a merge request to add a new TOML file for the
license using the
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/master/TEMPLATE.toml[TOML
file format] according the determined status (_allowed_,
_not-allowed_, _allowed-fonts_, _allowed-documentation_,
_allowed-content_, _allowed-firmware_).

The TOML file corresponding to a given license contains an
`expression` key whose value must be a valid SPDX license expression,
and the name of the TOML file incorporates this SPDX expression (for
example, the `expression` value in the `MIT.toml` file is "MIT").

What SPDX license expression to use for a new Fedora License Data TOML
file depends on the Fedora classification of the license as well as
how (if at all) the license has been dealt with by SPDX. There are
three typical cases:

* If your license already matches an identifier on the SPDX License List
(i.e., it was not necessary to create an SPDX License List issue), use
that identifier as the expression in the new TOML file.

* If an SPDX License List issue was created, SPDX has decided to add your
license as an identifier to the SPDX License List, and a pull request
for your license submission has been merged in the
https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML[SPDX license-list-XML
repository], use this new SPDX identifier as the expression in the new
TOML file.

* If Fedora has decided that the license is _not-allowed_, and the
license does not match an identifier on the SPDX License List, use the
SPDX `LicenseRef-` construct to create a custom-defined identifier for
the license and use that identifier as the expression in the new TOML
file.

There are special cases where Fedora may use a Fedora-defined
`LicenseRef-` identifier to represent an allowed license. Some of the
reasons why this may occur include:

* The license is believed to be unlikely to meet SPDX's license
inclusion guidelines, so the Fedora License Data maintainers have
indicated that an SPDX issue should not be created. This is expected
to be fairly uncommon but may occur for some _allowed-content_ licenses and
most _allowed-firmware_ licenses. For more info on _allowed-firmware_, see
xref:update-existing-packages[Update Existing Packages]

* An SPDX issue for an allowed license was created but SPDX ultimately
decided not to add the license to the SPDX License List. This is
expected to be very rare. Also, in cases where Fedora has a pressing need to publish
an update to a spec file and SPDX hasn't completed its review, Fedora may temporarily
use a `LicenseRef-`, to be replaced when SPDX adopts a new identifier for the license.

* The license qualifies to be covered by the umbrella license
identifiers `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`. For more on these scenarios,
see xref:update-existing-packages[Update Existing Packages]

* The license could be represented with a complex composite SPDX
license expression making use of one or more SPDX License List
identifiers, but it is simpler to represent it with a `LicenseRef-`
expression. These will generally be cases where there is also some
benefit to the use of a `LicenseRef-` to signal that something is
problematic about the license, even though Fedora has decided to
allow it. For a good example, see the TOML file for
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/data/LicenseRef-Bacula.toml?ref_type=heads[`LicenseRef-Bacula`]
and the related
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/277[issue].

* The license was classified as "good" under the (pre-SPDX) Callaway system,
but is believed to no longer be present in supported releases of Fedora.

If a license given a `LicenseRef-` identifier is later identified as a
match to a license on the SPDX License List (for example, because of a
later addition to the SPDX License List), then the Fedora License Data
repository should ideally be updated by replacing the TOML file with
a new TOML file using the SPDX identifier.

NOTE: In any case where a `LicenseRef-` is used, it is necessary to
copy the text of the license in the TOML file as the value of the
`text` key.

== Changes to licensing of Fedora Linux packages

Fedora package maintainers are responsible for regularly monitoring
the upstream source code of their packages for any changes or
additions to licenses. When a license changes upstream, or a new
license is introduced, the following guidelines apply:

* If the project adds material under a license that hasn't yet been
reviewed for inclusion in Fedora, then submit the new license for
review following the process described above.

* If the project adds material under a _not-allowed_ license, then the
package can no longer be included in Fedora Linux, unless you remove
the material covered by the _not-allowed_ license so that Fedora
will not be distributing anything under that license, including in
the source code of the
package. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/[FESCo] has the
authority to block upgrades of packages to versions with new
licenses that are not allowed for Fedora.

* If the new license is allowed, update the appropriate spec file
License tag, unless there is some reason why the license does not
have to be accounted for in the License tag. Refer to the page on
xref:license-field.adoc[populating spec file License tags] for
details.

Historically, Fedora package maintainers were expected to announce
upstream license changes that they became aware of on the
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora
devel list]. This expectation was probably based on the assumption
that any upstream license change would be a change to all or
substantially all the code in the project, but this is not always the
case.

If you are unsure about the status of a new license in a package,
please ask on the
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora
legal list].

= Spec File License: Tags

This page explains how to populate RPM spec file License: tags and is
aimed mainly at Fedora Linux package maintainers. We assume that you
are experienced in building packages for Fedora Linux, that you have
some familiarity with open source licensing, and that you have
carefully reviewed the documentation on xref:spdx.adoc[SPDX license
expressions] and xref:license-approval.adoc[Fedora license
approval]. If you are dealing with a specific package, we assume you
have already analyzed the licensing terms of the source code of the
package and determined how those terms map to SPDX license expressions
classified in the Fedora License Data repository.

== Definitions used in this page

=== "License"

For convenience, except where context indicates otherwise, this page
uses "license" narrowly to mean an SPDX license expression that
corresponds to a TOML file in the Fedora License Data repository.

Here are some examples of "licenses" in this sense:

* `GPL-2.0-or-later` (status: _allowed_)
* `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception` (status: _allowed_; example of `WITH` expression)
* `CC0-1.0` (status: _allowed-content_, and has a `usage` exception)
* `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` (status: _allowed_; Fedora-defined umbrella identifier)
// * `Artistic-1.0-Perl` (status: _not-allowed_)
// * `GPL-2.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl` (status: _allowed_; special case of allowed `OR` expression involving a _not-allowed_ license, specifically aimed at use in License: tags for Perl packages)
// * `MPL-2.0+` (status: _allowed_; uncommon use of `+` operator)
* `LicenseRef-sun-rpc` (status: _not-allowed_; Fedora-defined identifier)

=== "Fedora-acceptable"

We say that a license is "Fedora-acceptable" in the context of a
specific package if it is:

* _allowed_,
* allowed for a specific category of material (for example, _allowed-content_) and, in this package, it only covers that category, or
* _not-allowed_, or not allowed for a specific category of material, but its use in this package falls within the `usage` exception defined in the Fedora License Data TOML file for that license.

== Preliminary note

The Fedora convention is that License: tags describe a relevant
_subset_ of the licenses that apply to the source code of the
package. _Any_ license that applies to anything in the source code
must be Fedora-acceptable (assuming you actually need a license for
that material), even if it is ultimately not included in the License:
tag.

Therefore, before you can figure out how to populate the License: tag
for a package, you first need to analyze the source code of the
package to determine what licenses apply to that source code. If you
encounter any licenses that do not seem to map to what is already in
Fedora License Data, those licenses must be
xref:license-review-process.adoc[reviewed] for allowability in Fedora
based on Fedora's xref:license-approval.adoc[license approval]
criteria.

IMPORTANT: While typically "the source code of the package" refers solely
to what is contained in the SRPM of the package, in some situations it
refers additionally to source code of other Fedora packages. This is
discussed in the (as yet unwritten) section on <<bundling,Bundling, vendoring, static
linking, and related topics>>.

== Basic rule

The License: tag in the spec file Preamble must be populated with an
SPDX license expression that consists of a Fedora-acceptable license, or
multiple Fedora-acceptable licenses joined by `AND` and/or `OR`
operators. We say that such a license expression is itself
Fedora-acceptable.

Unless your package includes multiple binary subpackages and you opt
to specify <<subpkg,subpackage-specific License: tags>>, the Preamble
License: tag expression should be an enumeration of all licenses found
in the source code of the package, but excluding any licenses that
cover material in the source code that is not copied into the binary
RPM(s), either verbatim or transformed in some way (for example, by
compilation).

=== Simple example

====
The source code of the package `wayland-utils` is entirely under
`MIT`. The License: tag is:

`License:        MIT`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable, since `MIT` is _allowed_.
====

=== More complex example

====
The package `plasmatube` contains executable code
compiled from source code covered mostly by `GPL-3.0-or-later`, though
one compiled source file is under `GPL-2.0-or-later`. It also contains
an appdata.xml file that says it is under `CC0-1.0` (we'll assume
this file is copyrightable) and an SVG file that is under
`CC-BY-SA-4.0`. The License: tag is:

`License: GPL-3.0-or-later AND GPL-2.0-or-later AND CC0-1.0 AND CC-BY-SA-4.0`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable because: (1)
`GPL-3.0-or-later` and `GPL-2.0-or-later` are _allowed_; and (2)
`CC0-1.0` and `CC-BY-SA-4.0` are _allowed-content_, and appdata.xml
files and SVG files are classified as "content".
====

=== Source package files not included in binary RPM

Licenses that cover files in the source code that are not copied into
the binary RPM should be excluded from the License: tag. Consider the
package `xmodmap`:

====
The executable file and the man page that make up the `xmodmap` binary
RPM are transformations of files in the `xmodmap` source code that are
covered by `MIT` and `MIT-open-group`. However, the source tarball in
the `xmodmap` SRPM contains a number of Automake, Autoconf, and other
build-related files that are covered in part by a variety
of other licenses (namely, `FSFULLRWD`, `FSFULLR`, `GPL-2.0-or-later
WITH Autoconf-exception-generic`, `GPL-3.0-or-later WITH
Autoconf-exception-macro`, `GPL-3.0-or-later WITH
Autoconf-exception-generic-3.0`, `FSFUL`, `HPND-sell-variant`,
`FSFAP`, and `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`). These licenses are
all _allowed_, but since none of those files are copied into the
binary RPM, the corresponding licenses should not be included in the
License: tag. The License: tag is just:

`License: MIT AND MIT-open-group`

This license expression is Fedora-acceptable because `MIT` and
`MIT-open-group` are _allowed_.
====

RPM now supports a `SourceLicense:` tag in addition to the `License:` tag. You _may_ specify
source package-only licenses (along with whatever is in the `License:` tag) in the `SourceLicense` tag. Consider `xmodmap` again:

====
`xmodmap` _could_ validly include the following `SourceLicense:` tag:

`SourceLicense: MIT AND MIT-open-group AND FSFULLRWD AND FSFULLR AND GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic AND GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-macro AND GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-generic-3.0 AND FSFUL AND HPND-sell-variant AND FSFAP AND LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`
====

We don't recommend or encourage use of `SourceLicense:`.

== No "effective license" analysis

Except to the extent these guidelines state otherwise, you should not
attempt to simplify or reduce the License: tag license expression (for
example, based on a theory of GPL copyleft interpretation,
sublicensing, or license compatibility, or based on some sort of
algebraic transformation).

*Examples:*
====
In the License: tag for the `plasmatube` package, `GPL-2.0-or-later` should not be
omitted even though it can be argued that the "effective" license of the `plasmatube` executable is `GPL-3.0-or-later`.
====

====
In the `xmodmap` package, you might be able to come up with an
argument for why you can regard one or the other of `MIT` and
`MIT-open-group` as the single license of the files in the binary RPM,
though it is unclear how you would pick one of the two licenses in a
non-arbitrary way. Nevertheless, the License: tag should include both.
====

== `usage` exceptions

Some packages in Fedora may include a file covered by a _not-allowed_ license, or a license that is
only allowed for a particular category of material which is different from the category of the material
in the file. For this to be acceptable, the relevant license of the file must be covered by a "link:++https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/TEMPLATE.toml?ref_type=heads#L99++[`usage` exception]" indicating that the kind of use present in the file is tolerated by Fedora despite the fact that the license is normally not allowed. Where a package has a file covered by a normally disallowed license along with a `usage` exception, the License: tag rules apply as though the license
were allowed.

== Special rules for `OR` expressions

A license should normally appear only once in the License: tag license
expression. But if the license expression includes an `OR`
sub-expression, that `OR` sub-expression is treated as though it were
a single license for purposes of this rule. As an exception to this
rule, if _all_ the license operands of the `OR` sub-expression also
appear in the license expression outside the `OR` sub-expression, then
you can eliminate the `OR` sub-expression.

All the license operands of an `OR` expression should be preserved,
but only to the extent that those license operands are allowed. A
license operand in an `OR` expression that is not allowed should
normally be excluded from the License: tag license expression, which
in some cases will mean that the `OR` expression is replaced with a
single license.

*Example:*

====

The source code of the package `python-pyqt6-sip` is disjunctively
triple-licensed under the choice of `GPL-2.0-only`, `GPL-3.0-only`,
and the _not-allowed_ license `LicenseRef-Riverbank-SIP`. The License:
tag is:

`License: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`

It should not be `License: GPL-2.0-only`, or `License: GPL-3.0-only`,
because no choice should be made among a set of allowed licenses in an
`OR` expression. It should not be `License: GPL-2.0-only OR
GPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-Riverbank-SIP` because a _not-allowed_
license that is part of an `OR` expression should not be included in
the License: tag.

====

[[perl-rules]]
== Special rules for Perl packages

Perl 5 is released under a dual license that can be represented in
SPDX as `GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`. Many Perl modules say
simply that they are licensed under "the same terms as Perl
itself". Fedora treats this as an unambiguous reference to that
well-known Perl dual license.

`Artistic-1.0-Perl` is _not-allowed_. Normally this would mean that
packages that are under the Perl dual license should include only
`GPL-1.0-or-later` in the License: tag rather than the whole `OR`
expression. However, Fedora has accommodated preferences expressed by
Fedora Perl package maintainers and upstream Perl module maintainers
by permitting packages under the Perl dual license to use either

`GPL-1.0-or-later`

or

`GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`

To facilitate this option, Fedora License Data includes a TOML file
for `GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl` with the status
_allowed_. There is a similar TOML file for the less common variant
`GPL-2.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`.

*Example:*
====

The Perl module `Archive::Tar`, packaged in Fedora as
`perl-Archive-Tar`, is licensed upstream "under the same terms as Perl
itself". The License: tag is properly:

`License: GPL-1.0-or-later OR Artistic-1.0-Perl`

and this license expression is Fedora-acceptable, even though
`Artistic-1.0-Perl` itself is _not-allowed_.

====

[[notcopyrightable]]
== Use of `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`

The licenses encountered in upstream projects which are the subject of Fedora's license approval inquiry
can be thought of primarily as copyright licenses, though they may (and often must, to meet Fedora
license policy) grant other kinds of licenses as well. A copyright license is a grant of permission to
exercise one or more of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder. The scope of copyrightable subject
matter (and therefore what can properly be controlled by a copyright license) is limited, however. A good example is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%E2%80%93expression_distinction[idea-expression dichotomy].

Every Fedora package contains many elements that are not copyrightable, at
least when considered in isolation. One common example is character mappings,
such as Unicode character-to-name assignments. In some cases a nominal license
might purport to cover some material that is likely not copyrightable; this is
particularly common with material published by the Unicode Consortium and
unfortunately affects numerous community projects packaged in Fedora Linux.
Typically we ignore such licenses for purposes of license approval as well as
populating the License: tag.

However, in some cases, a binary RPM consists solely of such noncopyrightable
material. Since we want to avoid empty License: tags, in these cases we use the
special Fedora-defined SPDX expression `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`. (It
follows that `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` should never appear in a compound
SPDX license expression.)

*Example:*
====
The `dtv-scan-tables` binary RPM consists essentially of a large set of files
containing factual information on TV frequencies and modulation settings. Such
material is almost certainly not subject to copyright in the United States. By
tradition, Fedora assumes treatment of copyright in other jurisdictions will be
similar to treatment in the United States. The upstream project included copies
of GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1; arguably these licenses applied to the minimally
copyrightable README, but the README is not included in the binary RPM. The appropriate
License: tag is:

`License: LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`
====

== SPDX license expressions from upstream projects

=== Upstream use of SPDX identifiers

Increasingly, upstream community projects are attempting to use SPDX
identifiers (from the SPDX License List) in license metadata (most notably,
license-information fields of upstream packaging files). (Separately,
many projects have begun to use the
`SPDX-License-Identifier:` convention in source file comments in place
of traditional license notices. These are _generally_ more useful as
sources of information about package licensing.)

In general, you cannot assume that upstream use of SPDX license
identifiers in metadata is correct or accurate, at least from Fedora's standpoint,
and you should view them critically or skeptically.

=== `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-`

Much less commonly, a few upstream projects, most notably KDE, have adopted the use of SPDX
license expressions in a comprehensive manner comparable to Fedora. Like
Fedora, KDE defines certain custom `LicenseRef-` identifiers using the
prefix `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-`. As noted
elsewhere in this documentation, to date there is no official
namespacing approach for `LicenseRef-` identifiers, nor is there any
sort of cross-project convention for what various `LicenseRef-`
identifiers are supposed to signify.

Our current view is that KDE's `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL` identifier
should generally be represented by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only` in
Fedora, and `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL` should generally be
represented by `LGPL-2.1-only OR LGPL-3.0-only`.

[[subpkg]]
== Subpackage-specific License: tags

[[bundling]]
== Bundling, vendoring, static linking, and related topics
////
In some cases, the source code of a Fedora package (in the sense of
the contents of the package SRPM) will contain source code not only
from the upstream project being packaged but also from additional,
separate upstream locations. Of course, the licensing of all such
source code must be Fedora-acceptable. However, consistent with the
general guidelines given above, if the additional bundled source code
is not copied into the binary RPM, its licensing should not be
reflected in the License: tag.
////








////
The `rust2rpm` project provides a https://pagure.io/fedora-rust/rust2rpm/blob/main/f/tools/fedora-helper.py[helper script] that can be used to obtain a list of licenses of all real crate dependencies, excluding dependencies that are only required at build time or for running tests.
////

[[lppl]]
== LaTeX Project Public License

Packages under the LaTeX Project Public License version 1.2 (`LPPL-1.2`) or any
later version are allowed with the understanding that Fedora will
treat such packages as being licensed under the LaTeX Project Public
License version 1.3a or any later version.  It is not necessary to
include a copy of version 1.3a or to delete or replace copies of
version 1.2, or to alter any notices referring to version
1.2. However, any License tag that refers to the LPPL in this
situation should use `LPPL-1.3a+`, not `LPPL-1.2` (or `LPPL-1.2+`).


== APSL-1.x Licenses

Packages under the Apple Public Source License version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2
(`APSL-1.x`) are allowed with the understanding that Fedora will treat such
packages as being licensed under the Apple Public Source License version 2.0
(`APSL-2.0`).  It is not necessary to include a copy of version 1.x or to
delete or replace copies of version 1.x, or to alter any notices referring to
version 1.x. However, any License tag that refers to the APSL-1.x in this
situation should use `APSL-2.0`, not `APSL-1.0` (or `APSL-1.1` or `APSL-1.2`).

= Callaway-to-SPDX migration for existing packages

In July 2022 Fedora adopted the use of SPDX license expressions in place of the
legacy Callaway system for purposes of license approval classifications and
populating spec file License: tags.  As of early 2025, the migration from
Callaway to SPDX was characterized by one member of the Fedora Legal team as
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JT3PUXBB2IHQVPY5DHRXXHPUHH2XTQOC/[99.60%
complete].

By this stage, certain Callaway short names have been bulk-converted to SPDX
identifiers where there was adequate confidence that the Callaway name and the
SPDX identifier probably referenced the same underlying operative license text
("same", that is, in an SPDX-specific sense). Remaining Callaway short names in
License: tags, often involving "umbrella" Callaway short names that cover
multiple licenses that are represented with distinct identifiers in SPDX (for
example, "BSD"), have generally been crudely converted to valid SPDX format by
prefixing them with `LicenseRef-Callaway-` (for example, Callaway "BSD" becomes
`LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD`). It should be noted that these
`LicenseRef-Callaway-` expressions are not present in Fedora License Data as
valid licenses (allowed or otherwise). They are a temporary solution, for eventual
replacement with SPDX license expressions corresponding to TOML files in the Fedora License Data
repository.

Apart from replacement of `LicenseRef-Callaway-` License: tags, much ongoing
work will be needed to improve the accuracy of existing SPDX-format License: tags,
along with continuing review and classification of newly-encountered licenses.

== Changelog entry

Package maintainers whose packages still need to migrate License: tags to SPDX should
add the following line to the spec file `%changelog` section:

----
- migrated to SPDX license
----

or something similar using "spdx" in the changelog entry. This will help the Fedora legal team audit
packages.

== Updating Callaway umbrella names

The SPDX License List has an established set of https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/[matching guidelines] that define what constitutes a match to a license or exception on the SPDX License List. This ensures that SPDX license identifiers mean the same thing wherever they are used and takes a somewhat conservative approach as to what is substantively different. Each identifier for a license or an exception on the SPDX License List represents a single template text for that license or exception.

As noted above, some Callaway short names are umbrella categories referring to
a set of substantively different license texts that were treated as equivalent for Fedora
package metadata purposes. It follows that these Callaway names may correspond to multiple
(existing or future) SPDX identifiers. Review of the actual operative package license texts
will, of course, be necessary to determine what SPDX
identifier (or Fedora-recognized `LicenseRef-` expression) applies. In some cases, new licenses will need to undergo license review for inclusion in Fedora
License Data.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-MIT`

In the Callaway system, "MIT" was used to refer to a large number of short permissive licenses having some loose textual similarity or tenuous historical connection to the SPDX `MIT` license (the license that, today, most people mean when they refer to "the MIT license"), and which did _not_ resemble licenses in the historical BSD family.

The SPDX License List contains not only `MIT` but many other licenses that Callaway "MIT" covered, or was
intended to cover.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD`

In the Callaway system, "BSD" was used to refer to a large number of short
permissive licenses bearing some textual similarity or historical connection to
licenses in the BSD family.

Many of the licenses in the BSD family are included in the SPDX License List, including two of the most
commonly encountered BSD-family licenses, `BSD-3-Clause` and `BSD-2-Clause`. Note that `BSD` itself is
not an SPDX license identifier.

=== `with-exceptions`

In the Callaway system, the phrase "with exceptions" was sometimes affixed to
GPL-family short names. This was normally meant to indicate that the relevant
GPL-family license was coupled with a permissive exception or additional
permission, though there were some historical examples of use of "with
exceptions" to refer to additional restrictive terms.

SPDX has an exception list covering some of the more commonly-encountered
license exceptions or additional permissions, including many of the exceptions
traditionally used with GPL-family licenses. However, it is likely that new
exceptions will need to be proposed to SPDX upon review of Fedora packages that
historically used the "with exceptions" Callaway sub-label.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2` and `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2+`

The Callaway system deliberately did not distinguish between LGPLv2 and
LGPLv2.1, using "LGPLv2" to represent both. SPDX has distinct identifiers for
these licenses, so `LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2` will likely correspond to one
or more of SPDX `LGPL-2.0-only` and `LGPL-2.1-only`, and
`LicenseRef-Callaway-LGPLv2+` will likely correspond to one or more of
`LGPL-2.0-or-later` and `LGPL-2.1-or-later`.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-Public-domain`

In the Callaway system, "Public domain" was used for a few distinct
purposes.

==== Bespoke public domain dedications

Callaway "Public domain" most commonly signified the presence
of a bespoke public domain dedication covering all or part of the
package. (By "bespoke", we mean that the instrument releasing material
into the public domain wasn't a relatively standardized and elaborate
form having some of the characteristics of public domain dedications,
such as SPDX `CC0-1.0` or `Unlicense`.) The SPDX License List does not
have an identifier corresponding to this categorical public domain
dedication concept.

Fedora has adopted the umbrella identifier `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` to
represent bespoke public domain dedications. Note that these must be
reviewed and approved just like any other license. Currently we attempt
to store approved public domain dedications (those that qualify for
representation with `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`) in the file
`public-domain-text.txt` in the Fedora License Data repository, although
we recognize there might be a more satisfactory approach. At this time
it does not seem likely that SPDX will itself adopt some sort of
comparable umbrella identifier.

==== Noncopyrightable material

In some packages, Callaway "Public domain" reflected a conclusion that
substantial parts of the package were not likely not copyrightable. This
is generally not recorded in the package, so the absence of any public
dedication statements coupled with `LicenseRef-Callaway-Public-domain`
may be a clue that historical "Public domain" was used for this
noncopyrightable subcategory.

In the post-Callaway SPDX system, we use the Fedora-defined license
expression `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` to cover such cases. However,
in spec file License: tags we only use `LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` if
otherwise the License: tag would be empty. That is to say, we only use
`LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable` if that label would accurately cover the
entire contents of the binary RPM.

==== Works of U.S. government employees

Some uses of Callaway "Public domain" appear to have been based on the
assumption that code or content in a package was created by employees of
the U.S. federal (i.e., national) government.
In the United States, works of the federal government are not
protectable by copyright within the U.S. (see
https://law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105[17 U.S.C. &#167; 105]).
It is fairly clear that this statutory provision should not have any
copyright implications outside the U.S. Nonetheless, in FOSS legal
culture it has been commonly assumed for convenience that works that are
public domain in the U.S. under 17 U.S.C. &#167; 105 are equivalently
unrestricted in other jurisdictions. There is a common-sense
basis for this assumption, but it implies that the conclusion for the
non-U.S. situation rests on there being an implicit public domain
dedication. For at least this reason, `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` is the
appropriate license expression in these cases rather than
`LicenseRef-Not-Copyrightable`. In such cases, nothing would be added to
the `public-domain-text.txt` file unless the package used some sort of
public domain dedication text.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-Copyright-only`

In the Callaway system "Copyright only" was typically, but
inconsistently, used for very brief bespoke or nonstandard legacy
licenses whose only explicit requirement was
preservation of a copyright notice.

There is no single SPDX identifier corresponding to the typical use of
Callaway "Copyright only". Some of the underlying package licenses
associated with this label have been added to the SPDX License List, but
it is expected that many more will be identified in Fedora license
reviews. We currently do not think an umbrella identifier would be
suitable to represent this category of licenses.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-Freely-redistributable-without-restrictions`

In the Callaway system, "Freely redistributable without restrictions"
was apparently a relatively old name that was deprecated some years
prior to the adoption of SPDX. While it may not have been used
consistently, it seems to have most commonly been used to represent
brief bespoke or nonstandard permission statements that imposed no
requirements, but which did not take the form of public domain dedications.

In the post-Callaway system there is a custom identifier,
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`, which is intended to serve as an
umbrella representation for these kinds of permission statements.
There is no equivalent identifier in the SPDX License List that
corresponds to this category. We attempt to track specific permission
statements qualifying for `LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` in the
file `UltraPermissive.txt` in the Fedora License Data repository.

=== `LicenseRef-Callaway-Redistributable-no-modification-permitted`

In the Callaway system, "Redistributable, no modification permitted" was
mainly used to cover non-FOSS firmware licenses. Apparently there were
also rare cases of non-firmware packages using this label in the
License: tag.

Fedora now has a custom SPDX license expression,
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Firmware`, which is intended to cover firmware
licenses that do not meet the requirements for _allowed_ status but
which satisfy the relaxed criteria for _allowed-firmware_. License texts
are stored in the file `firmware.txt` in the Fedora License Data
repository.

Non-FOSS firmware licenses likely would not meet the SPDX License
Inclusion Guidelines, so there is no point in submitting them to SPDX.

==== `Public-Domain` or `Ultrapermissive`?

Sometimes, it may be hard to decide if the license should be
`LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or `LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`. E.g.,
consider this example:

----
The author of this program disclaims copyright.
----

This one should clearly qualify for either `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain` or
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive`, but which one? Thus far, we've been
applying the convention that a permission statement has to contain the words
"public domain" to qualify for `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`. We've used
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` to approximately replace Callaway system
"Freely redistributable without restrictions" which we have been taking to
refer to unconditional permission grants of some sort that don't take the form
of public domain dedications. This grant is different, though, in that it
doesn't mention the public domain but is a "disclaimer" of copyright rather than an
explicit grant of permission. This is slightly closer in spirit to what
we have been using `LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain`. Although using
`LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive` is no big mistake. When you are in doubt,
submit a
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/new[review issue].

=== `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-*`

KDE project uses https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL[LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-*] licenses. This was discussed https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/350[here] and https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/351[here]. The consensus is that upstream license `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL` should be replaced in Fedora by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`. And upstream license `LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-LGPL` should be replaced by `LGPL-2.1-only OR LGPL-3.0-only`.

=== `LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-*`

KDE project uses
https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/qqc2-desktop-style/-/blob/master/LICENSES/LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-GPL.txt[LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-*]
licenses. This was discussed
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/374[here]. The
consensus is that upstream license `LicenseRef-KFQF-Accepted-GPL` should be
replaced in Fedora by `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`.


=== Small category short names

Several Callaway short names are known to correspond to two or more SPDX
identifiers but it is possible that some of those identifiers are not
yet included in Fedora License Data.
Some of these Callaway short names are (in current `LicenseRef-` wrapped
format):

* `LicenseRef-Callaway-MIT-with-advertising`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-BSD-with-advertising`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-MPLv1.0`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-MPLv1.1`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-CECILL`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-HSRL`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-Python`
* `LicenseRef-Callaway-AFL`

= License audit tooling for Fedora packages

This page describes some of the tools that have been used to audit
licensing of packages in Fedora Linux.

== Packaging tools

The following tools are specifically designed for use with Fedora Linux
packages. They use the
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data[Fedora License
Data] as a source of data on valid licenses.

=== rpmlint

https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint[rpmlint] is the standard tool used for evaluating Fedora Linux packages for well-known issues for packagers to fix.
In the context of licensing, rpmlint evaluates the `License:` field in the spec file and ensures the values conform to xref:allowed-licenses.adoc[the known set of allowed licenses].

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `rpmlint`.

=== rpminspect

https://github.com/rpminspect/rpminspect[rpminspect] is the tool used to evaluate Fedora Linux packages for policy compliance, differences as compared to previous builds, and common packaging errors as they are built in the Fedora Build System.
In the context of licensing, rpminspect evaluates the `License:` field in RPMs and ensures the values conform to xref:allowed-licenses.adoc[the known set of allowed licenses].

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `rpminspect`. To use it, you need both `rpminspect` and `rpminspect-data-fedora`.

=== license-validate

https://pagure.io/copr/license-validate/[license-validate] validates license strings. It can validate the Callaway format and SPDX expressions. Without the `-v` flag, the command does not print anything and will return a non-zero exit code when the license expression is invalid.

---
$ license-validate -v --old 'GPLv2 or MIT'
Approved license
$ license-validate -v 'GPL-2.0-only OR MIT'
Approved license
---

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `license-validate`.

== License matching to SPDX License List for a specific license text

The SPDX project has guidance on various tools and methods to determine if a given license text matches a license already on the SPDX License List. See https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md[license match]

If you identify a license or exception text as a match
to an SPDX identifier, you can then use the SPDX identifier to search
in the *allowed* and *not-allowed* license lists for Fedora.

== License scanning tools for source code

The following tools have been used by Fedora Project contributors to
detect licenses in the source code of current and proposed Fedora Linux
packages. All of these tools are distribution-agnostic.

=== Licensecheck

https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Licensecheck[Licensecheck] is a tool used to analyze the licensing of source files. This tool is principally used in the Fedora context for
the initial package review for packages proposed for inclusion in Fedora Linux. Licensecheck is run automatically as part of https://pagure.io/FedoraReview[FedoraReview].

By default, licensecheck provides license reports with full license names, but can be used to produce output using any number of license identifier schemes.

This is packaged in Fedora Linux as `licensecheck`.

=== askalano

https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono[Askalono], packaged in Fedora
as `askalono-cli`, is a simple license scanning tool written in
Rust. It is most useful for quick analysis of packages coming out of
ecosystems featuring projects known to have (1) highly standardized
approaches to layout of license information (it specifically looks
only for files that are named LICENSE or COPYING or some obvious
variant on those), (2) generally simple license makeup, and (3)
cultural preferences for a highly limited set of licenses (for
example, Rust crates that don't bundle legacy C code, Go modules, or
Node.js npm packages).

Askalono has some significant shortcomings. It can't recognize or
understand: (1) license notices/license texts that are comments in
source files, (2) license notices/license texts in README files, (3)
license files that contain multiple license texts (or it will only
recognize the first of them), and (4) nonstandard/archaic/legacy
licenses (which covers most of the licenses being reviewed in issues
in fedora-license-data)

=== FOSSology

https://www.fossology.org/[FOSSology] is a license compliance software
system and tooklit that includes license scanning. It can be run locally and
also can be set up as a hosted service. The FOSSology website provides
information on https://www.fossology.org/get-started/[using a test instance] hosted by
the OSU Open Source Lab.

FOSSology is good for scanning an entire package for licenses (or texts
that look like licenses). Files can be viewed easily in the FOSSology
interface. FOSSology has the ability to remember past license
inspection decisions.

Some tips on using FOSSology:
* In Options:
** #5 - check "Ignore SCM files"
** #7 - check Monk, Nomos, Ojo License Analysis and Package Analysis
** #8 - check first two options re: "Scanners matches..."
* Go to License Browswer view. Look for license matches that are suspicious or
unexpected, such as things that are not an SPDX identifier or ambiguous. You
can then view the files with those matches and inspect what was found to
determine if there is a license that needs to be recorded or if it is a false
match. https://www.fossology.org/get-started/basic-workflow/[Basic Workflow]
has some helpful information.

FOSSology is not packaged in Fedora.

=== ScanCode toolkit

https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit[ScanCode toolkit] is a
command-line Python tool and library for detecting licenses,
copyrights, package metadata and related information in source
and binary code. ScanCode detects licenses by doing a diff
against a database of 37,000 license texts and notices.

ScanCode output includes SPDX documentat and a variety of other formats
including JSON, YAML, HTML, CSV, CycloneDX and Debian machine
readable copyright files.

ScanCode reports detected license information using valid SPDX license
expressions (and also ScanCode's own extended list of license keys
that includes licenses that are not included in the SPDX License
List). It applies the SPDX matching guidelines when possible and
provides detailed information on the matched texts and detected licenses.

ScanCode toolkit is also embedded in other tools such as
FOSSology, https://github.com/tern-tools/tern[tern],
https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort[ORT], and https://fosslight.org/[FOSSLight].

ScanCode toolkit packaging in Fedora is in progress.
It can be installed using pip or an app tarball.

The recommended way of running ScanCode is:
`scancode --license --html output.html --license-references -n$(nproc --all)`

=== ScanCode.io
https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io[ScanCode.io] is a web application
to run ScanCode toolkit pipelines on multiple projects.
A pipeline is a script to organize the code analysis of large
codebases, binaries, containers (or single packages) with
optional code matching against an index of pre-existing FOSS code.
ScanCode.io is useful for scanning an entire package for licenses notices,
license texts and "license clues". Files can be viewed easily in the ScanCode.io interface.
See http://scancode.io/[Documentation] to get started.

ScanCode.io is not yet packaged in Fedora.
It can be installed using containers and podman.

=== Trivy

https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[Trivy] is more robust than Askalono or Licensecheck but less verbose than ScanCode. Upstream provides static RPM packages.

You can run the check with command: `trivy fs --scanners license --license-full .`

More details about https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/scanner/license/[Trivy license scanning].
= How to identify package licenses

The information about what licenses apply to a project typically can
be found in a few places:

* *License files*: The source code may contain a specific file
containing just the license text (most often named LICENSE or
COPYING, but many other conventions and variant practices
exist). These license files are usually, but not always, in the
root directory of the source tree. There may be more than one such
file, in which case, hopefully, there is information elsewhere in
the source tree that explains the applicability of the different
licenses. License files may also be present in non-root directories
in the source tree, such as in cases where the files in one part of
the source tree are licensed under a license that is different from
the rest of the source tree.

* *Source files*: License notices referencing a particular license, or
even the full text of relatively short licenses, are often found in
source files. License notices may include: standard license notices
suggested by the license itself (e.g., GPL, Apache-2.0); short
concise statements (e.g., "This file is under the MIT license" or
"SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT"); statements that simply refer to
the license file that require finding that file (e.g., "See
COPYING"); or unclear or ambiguous statements that require further
investigation (e.g., "This file is licensed the same as Ruby").

* Information about applicable license terms may be present in
descriptive form, such as a statement in a README, the project
webpage, metadata intended for a downstream packaging system or
package repository, or in a file dedicated to explaining the license
terms.

Unfortunately, it is rather common for this sort of information to be
inconsistent with or contradict other license information
elsewhere. While it's difficult to give general guidance on this
situation, you generally cannot ignore license information that is
"closer" to the code (for example, a license notice in a source file)
even if it might seem to be contradicted by license information
"further" from the code (for example, a license statement in a
top-level README or on a project website).

== Phantom licenses

As a project evolves, it is not uncommon for license information in
the project repository to become outdated. This is less likely to be
the case for license files and source file license notices. But we
have been finding this to be a problem for relatively old and complex
projects that have recorded some information about third-party
licensing in so-called "notice files" or other files containing
informal license information. The file will say that a particular
license applies to something in the repository, but close examination
may reveal that the material the license applied to has been deleted
from the repository. We have been using the term "phantom license" to
refer to this phenomenon.

Because such phantom licenses don't actually apply to anything being
packaged, you do not need to ensure that they are allowed for Fedora
and you do not need to include them in the SPDX expression in the
license tag. Of course, you should only conclude that something is a
phantom license if it is clear that what it was formerly applicable to
is no longer present in the repository. If you find a phantom license,
we encourage you to report it to the upstream project.

= Fedora Project Contributor Agreement

The only purpose of the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA) is to ensure that Fedora has default permission to use your contributions under a Fedora-allowed license (either MIT for software or CC BY-SA for content). You may contribute under any other allowed Fedora license; the FPCA simply sets a default if no license is specified.

Nothing in the FPCA takes anything away from you. You retain ownership of your contributions.

If you have any questions about the FPCA, please email legal@fedoraproject.org.

----
The Fedora Project Contributor Agreement
[Version 2021-05-04]

Goal
---------

We require that contributors to Fedora (as defined below) agree to
this Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA) to ensure that
contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms.

Non-Goals
---------

The FPCA is *not* a copyright assignment agreement.

The FPCA does *not* somehow supersede the existing licensing terms
that apply to Fedora contributions.  There are two important subpoints
here.  First, the FPCA does not apply to upstream code (or other
material) that you didn't write; indeed, it would be preposterous for
it to attempt to do so.  Note the narrow way in which we have defined
capital-c "Contribution".  Second, the main provision of the FPCA
specifies that a default license will apply to code that you wrote,
but only to the extent that you have not bothered to put an explicit
license on it. Therefore, the FPCA is *not* some sort of special
permissive license granted to any party, despite the explicit choice
of a more restrictive license by you or by upstream developers.

Terms
---------

0.  Definitions.

"Acceptable License For Fedora" means a license selected from the
appropriate categorical sublist of the full list of acceptable
licenses for Fedora, currently located at
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/allowed-licenses/,
as that list may be revised from time to time by the Fedora Council.
"Acceptable Licenses For Fedora" means that full list.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International license, as published at
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode>.

"Code" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional material
whose principal purpose is to control or facilitate the building of
packages, such as an RPM spec file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other
kinds of copyrightable material that the Fedora Council has
classified as "code" rather than "content".

"Content" means any copyrightable material that is not Code, such as,
without limitation, (i) non-functional data sets, (ii) documentation,
(iii) wiki edits, (iv) music files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help
files, and (vii) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Fedora
Council has classified as "content" rather than "code".

"Contribution" means a Work that You created, excluding any portion
that was created by someone else.  (For example, if You Submit a
package to Fedora, the spec file You write may be a Contribution, but
all the upstream code in the associated SRPM that You did not write is
not a Contribution for purposes of this FPCA.)  A Contribution
consists either of Code or of Content.

"Current Default License", with respect to a Contribution, means (i)
if the Contribution is Code, the MIT License, and (ii) if the
Contribution is Content, CC-BY-SA.

"Fedora" means the community project led by the Fedora Council
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/>.

"Fedora Community" means (i) all Fedora participants, and (ii) all
persons receiving Contributions directly or indirectly from or through
Fedora.

"Licensed" means covered by explicit licensing terms that are
conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients.

"MIT License" means the license identified as "Modern Style with
sublicense" at
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT#Modern_Style_with_sublicense>.

"Submit" means to use some mode of digital communication (for example,
without limitation, mailing lists, bug tracking systems, and source
code version control systems administered by Fedora) to voluntarily
provide a Contribution to Fedora.

"Unlicensed" means not Licensed.

"Work" means a copyrightable work of authorship. A Work may be a
portion of a larger Work, and a Work may be a modification of or
addition to another Work.

"You" means the individual accepting this instance of the FPCA.

1. Copyright Permission Required for All Contributions.

If You are not the copyright holder of a given Contribution that You
wish to Submit to Fedora (for example, if Your employer or university
holds copyright in it), it is Your responsibility to first obtain
authorization from the copyright holder to Submit the Contribution
under the terms of this FPCA on behalf of, or otherwise with the
permission of, that copyright holder.  One form of such authorization
is for the copyright holder to place, or permit You to place, an
Acceptable License For Fedora on the Contribution.

2.  Licensed Contributions.

If Your Contribution is Licensed, Your Contribution will be governed
by the terms under which it has been licensed.

3.  Default Licensing of Unlicensed Contributions.

If You Submit an Unlicensed Contribution to Fedora, the license to the
Fedora Community for that Contribution shall be the Current Default
License.

The Fedora Council may, by public announcement, subsequently
designate an additional or alternative default license for a given
category of Contribution (a "Later Default License"). A Later Default
License shall be chosen from the appropriate categorical sublist of
Acceptable Licenses For Fedora.

Once a Later Default License has been designated, Your Unlicensed
Contribution shall also be licensed to the Fedora Community under that
Later Default License.  Such designation shall not affect the
continuing applicability of the Current Default License to Your
Contribution.

You consent to having Fedora provide reasonable notice of Your
licensing of Your Contribution under the Current Default License (and,
if applicable, a Later Default License) in a manner determined by
Fedora.

4.  Public Domain United States Government Works.

Sections 1 through 3 of this FPCA do not apply to any Contribution to
the extent that it is a work of the United States Government for which
copyright is unavailable under 17 U.S.C. 105.

5.  Acceptance.

You must signify Your assent to the terms of this FPCA through
specific electronic means established by Fedora (such as by
click-through acceptance means).

You may also, at Your option, and without eliminating the requirement
set forth in the preceding paragraph, send a copy of this FPCA,
bearing Your written signature indicating Your acceptance of its
terms, by email to legal@fedoraproject.org, by fax to +1 919 754 3704,
or by postal mail to:

== Frequently Asked questions

Q: What is the purpose of the FPCA? +
A: The FPCA exists for one main reason: to ensure that contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms.

Q: If I agree to the FPCA, am I assigning copyright to Fedora or Red Hat? +
A: No. The FPCA is not a copyright assignment agreement.

Q: Does this mean that Fedora will always relicense my contributions from $MY_LICENSE to MIT? +
A: No. If you put a Fedora-allowed license on your contribution, we will use it under the terms of that license. If you put it under a not-allowed license, we won't use it at all. Only unlicensed contributions where the copyright holder is the Fedora contributor qualify for the "default licensing" clause.

Q: If I make a contribution to a Fedora project that is clearly licensed under GPLv2-or-later, and my changes don't have an explicit GPL or other license notice on them, does the FPCA mean I am making my changes under the MIT license? +
A: No. In this case, Fedora views your contribution as "Licensed", i.e., "covered by explicit licensing terms that are conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients". Those licensing terms are GPLv2-or-later. So your changes are licensed under GPLv2-or-later and the FPCA default license does not apply.

Q: Do I need to physically sign the FPCA? +
A: No. We require that all contributors agree to it digitally, through the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Accounts System]. If you wish to additionally sign a physical copy and send it to us, the FPCA describes how to do this, but it is *not* required.

Q: Are all Fedora users/distributors required to agree to the FPCA? +
A: No. Only Fedora contributors will be required to agree to the FPCA. Although, if you want to agree to it, you can. :)

Q: The FPCA defines "default licenses" of MIT for code, and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 for content, why not $OTHER_LICENSE? +
A: The MIT license was chosen for code because of its widespread use (including in Fedora-related projects and Fedora Linux packages) and compatibility with other free licenses. CC BY-SA was chosen (originally version 3.0, later version 4.0) because it came to be significantly preferred by Fedora contributors developing documentation and content for Fedora.

Q: If I'm granting the MIT license or CC BY-SA by default, how is Fedora dealing with the notice or attribution requirements of those licenses? +
A: The FPCA says: "You consent to having Fedora provide reasonable notice of Your
licensing of Your Contribution under the Current Default License (and,
if applicable, a Later Default License) in a manner determined by
Fedora." Since adoption of the FPCA, Fedora has been treating as "reasonable notice" public notice of the FPCA as an inbound licensing policy coupled with the public record of particular Fedora contributions; any other approach would be impractical. Fedora views this "reasonable notice of Your licensing" as covering license notice provisions of the MIT license and CC BY-SA. As for attribution under CC BY-SA, Fedora's view is that any contributor of "Unlicensed Content" does not desire attribution because they did not specify an attribution preference when making the contribution. You can always use an explicit license on your contributions if you prefer, including any preferred copyright notice or author attribution.

Q: Are RPM spec files covered by the FPCA? +
A: Yes, assuming a given spec file is subject to copyright. Spec files are explicitly named as an example of a contribution, to clear up a past confusion.

Q: Can we translate the FPCA into other languages? +
A: Yes, although only the English text is binding for the purposes of agreement. Any translations which are created are not "legal translations", and exist only to assist non-English speaking contributors. All Fedora contributors must agree to the English text.

Q: I have a question/suggestion/flame about the FPCA that is not covered here, where should I send it to? +
A: If you want to discuss it in public, please subscribe to the https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/legal[fedora-legal-list] and post your thoughts there. If you do not wish to discuss it in public, feel free to send it via email to legal@fedoraproject.org.

Q: Can I use the FPCA as a license for my code/content? +
A: Well, technically, you can do whatever you want, but you really shouldn't. It wouldn't work very well.

Q: My FOSS friendly project would like to take the FPCA, change Fedora to the name of our project, and use the FPCA, can we do this? +
A: Sure. You can consider the FPCA to be under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0, with the notable exception of the Fedora trademarks, which may only be used under the Fedora Trademark Guidelines. If modified, attribution should occur in the actual document itself. For attribution in other scenarios, please contact legal@fedoraproject.org. One piece of advice: If you decide to make changes beyond simply changing the name of the FPCA or replacing the Fedora trademarks, you really should consult with a lawyer, to make sure that the document is still legally valid and says what you mean. Remember, legalese is not English.

Q: Who wrote this amazing masterpiece of legal text? +
A: Many people were involved in helping to craft this text. The primary author was Richard Fontana, with feedback from Tom Callaway, Pamela Chestek, Paul Frields, and Robert Tiller. Feel free to give them gifts (for example, drinks or tasty snacks) as thank yous, although, this is not a requirement (legal or otherwise). ;)

== Historical FAQs

Some of the following FAQs refer to the Fedora Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA), which preceded adoption of the FPCA in 2011 and which was no longer used after adoption of the FPCA.

Q: Why change the Fedora ICLA to the FCPA? +
A: The previous agreement, the Fedora ICLA, wasn't really well structured for the needs of Fedora. It was composed of a lot of legal boilerplate, and was written before Fedora had really taken shape. In fact, the only reason that we were able to leverage it for as long as we did is because of some creative interpretation on the part of Fedora Legal. Also, there were many people who could not agree to the Fedora ICLA for a variety of reasons, and we hoped that the FPCA would resolve most (if not all) of those concerns.

Q: Why did you change the name from ICLA to FPCA? +
A: The new text is not really a "Contributor License Agreement" in the traditional sense. The FPCA exists for one main reason: to ensure that contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms. We chose a name that did not use "CLA" to avoid confusion and to mark it as a distinctly specific license.

Q: When was the Fedora ICLA retired? +
A: There was be a window of time (between Tuesday May 17, 2011 and Friday June 17, 2011) when we attempted to get all current Fedora contributors who had agreed to the Fedora ICLA to agree to the FPCA. Once that window closed, any contributors in the system who did not agree to the FPCA were removed from "cla_done" (note: including membership in other, dependent FAS groups).

Q: What changed between the 2011-03-29 Version and the 2015-02-03 Version? +
A. The 2011-03-29 version referenced the Fedora Board, which has been obsoleted/replaced by the Fedora Council. The FPCA text was updated to reflect that change. No other changes were made.

Q: What changed between the 2015-02-03 Version and the 2021-05-04 Version? +
A: The Fedora Council updated the default content license to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0) license.

Q: What changed between the 2021-05-04 Version and the 2021-10-25 edit? +
A: The Fedora Council removed accidentally-overlooked clauses in the text which were made obsolete by the update to CC-BY-SA 4.0. The FAQ was also updated to refer to the 4.0 version of the license.
= License Compatibility

License compatibility is a FOSS legal folk doctrine that concerns the
combinability of code covered by different licenses. It has no
specific basis in statutory or judge-made law. Much of the discourse
around license compatibility is incoherent, contradictory and poorly
reasoned, and rests on dubious interpretive foundations.

Even when relatively clearly formulated, pronouncements on license
compatibility tend to have a restrictive bias. Fedora has long taken a
skeptical view of such pronouncements, which are typically
inconsistent with deeply established packaging traditions and
development practices of community Linux distributions and other FOSS
community projects.

Despite this general standpoint of skepticism, Fedora takes assertions
of license incompatibility seriously. Indeed, in (extremely) rare
cases, packages have been excluded from Fedora Linux because of a
license incompatibility issue.

If you believe there is a license incompatibility problem of some sort
raised by a Fedora Linux package, we encourage you to
https://bugzilla.redhat.com[file a bug report]. We will investigate
the issue in due course.

TIP: License compatibility issues are off-topic for the
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data[Fedora License
Data] project.

= Miscellaneous legal packaging topics

This page provides information on various legal or licensing aspects of Fedora packaging, such as certain non-license criteria for approval of certain kinds of packages or files in Fedora Linux, and certain specific interpretations of licensing issues made by Fedora.

== License of Fedora spec files

All original Fedora contributions are governed by the
xref:fpca.adoc[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA)]. For all
practical purposes, all Fedora spec files are contributed by FPCA
signers. This means that unless a spec file contains an explicit
license or license notice stating otherwise, or there is some other
evidence to the contrary, the spec file is available under the terms
of the MIT license, to the extent it is copyrightable. Where there is
no explicit MIT license notice in a spec file, it is understood that
there is no requirement to add one (that is to say, the "default" MIT
license is equivalent to https://opensource.org/license/mit-0/[MIT No
Attribution]).

== Emulators

Some emulators (applications which emulate another platform) are not permitted for inclusion in Fedora Linux. These rules will help you determine if an emulator is acceptable for Fedora.

* Emulators which depend on firmware or ROM files to function may not be
included in Fedora Linux, unless the copyright holder(s) for the firmware/ROM
files give clear permission for the firmware/ROM files to be distributed
(either under a Fedora _allowed_ license or a Fedora _allowed-firmware_
license). Note: This only covers the situation where an emulator will not run
at all without firmware/ROM files. For example, emulators that compile and run,
but ship with no game ROMs are not covered by this rule.

* Emulators must not ship with any ROM files (e.g. games) unless those ROM files are available under a Fedora _allowed_ license and have been built from source code in the Fedora buildsystem.

* Emulators must not point to any third-party sites which provide firmware or ROM files that are distributed without the clear and explicit permission of their copyright holders.

* All other Fedora licensing and packaging rules apply to emulators.

== Licensing of RSA implementations of MD5

It is common to encounter old RSA reference C implementations of the MD5 message-digest algorithm under a free software license containing an advertising requirement, similar to the better-known advertising clause in old versions of the BSD license. Such advertising clauses have generally been understood to be GPL-incompatible. The RSA license is included in the SPDX License List under the short identifier https://spdx.org/licenses/RSA-MD.html[`RSA-MD`]. The MD5 reference implementation also appears in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1321[RFC 1321], which states that distribution of the RFC document is "unlimited."

In 2000 RSA provided a https://www.ietf.org/ietf-ftp/ietf/IPR/RSA-MD-all[clarification] of "the status of intellectual property rights asserted by [RSA] in the MD2, MD4 and MD5 message-digest algorithms", saying "Implementations of these message-digest algorithms, including
implementations derived from the reference C code in RFC-1319, RFC-1320, and
RFC-1321, may be made, used, and sold without license from RSA for any
purpose."

Fedora traditionally interpreted this RSA statement as, in effect, superseding the `RSA-MD` license except to the extent that the license required "copyright attribution".

Under present-day policies for populating the spec file License: field, if you encounter RSA code under this license, you do not need to, and probably should not, do any of the following:

* Record `RSA-MD` (or any other license identifier) in the License: field
* Install a copy of the RSA license in /usr/share/licenses
* Copy or reference the external 2000 RSA statement

However, unless you have guidance from Fedora Legal suggesting otherwise, you should retain the RSA copyright and license notice as found in the upstream source code.

== Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)

The following ECC curves are currently permitted in Fedora:

|Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal|CC0|Existing uses of CC0-1.0 on code files in Fedora packages prior to
2022-08-01, and subsequent upstream versions of those files in those
packages, continue to be allowed. We encourage Fedora package
maintainers to ask upstreams to relicense such files.

Upstream application of CC0-1.0 to trivial, noncreative, unoriginal,
and nonexpressive material as part of an effort to achieve conformance
to the REUSE specification (https://reuse.software/) (for example,
CI/CD configuration files) is permitted regardless of whether such
material would normally be classified as "content".

Implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms released
under CC0-1.0 and included in the liboqs library
(https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) as of 2023-07-12, and
modified versions of those implementations, are allowed, as noted in

= *Allowed* Licenses

This page lists the all the licenses that are *allowed* for use in Fedora. If a
license is marked as *allowed*, it is allowed for any use. If a license is
marked as *allowed-fonts*, *allowed-content*, *allowed-documentation*, or
*allowed-firmware*, then it is allowed only for certain categories of material
as described in xref:license-approval.adoc[License Approval]. This information
is generated from data maintained in the
https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data[Fedora License Data]
repository. xref:allowed-licenses.adoc contains the same information, but
broken out to different tables for each category of *allowed*.

There is kernel usage exception to cover certain kernel space uses.
Fedora cannot grant any exceptions to the prohibition on BSD-3-Clause-Clear for userspace packages.

drivers in the Fedora kernel package (and minor modifications to those uses in
those drivers) are acceptable despite not being open source and, in principle,

|This LICENSE file states terms that the UPX project characterizes as an exception to GPLv2-or-later. Based on some changes made by the maintainers:
https://github.com/upx/upx/commit/295889023fdf2818b381deb779fe21452cf2988d#diff-2b7814d3fca2e99e56c51b6ff2aa313ea6e9da6424804240aa8ad891fdfe0900R92
https://github.com/upx/upx/commit/295889023fdf2818b381deb779fe21452cf2988d#diff-8fb22d0484d91bba91b05e1435439d177c03610ec37e59097a15d4c7aeb0f086R943
our understanding is that certain statements in this file (particularly in the "Annotations" section) are not interpretations of and limitations placed on GPLv2 itself but rather explanations of certain requirements embodied in the GPL exception. It is not clear whether these statement are best viewed as a GPL exception (in the orthodox GPL community sense of an additional permission) or as an alternative non-GPL license.

Regardless of whether these statements are seen as a GPL exception or as an alternative license, they should be classified as "not-allowed" for Fedora. However, given the clarifications made by the UPX maintainers, UPX is permitted to be packaged in Fedora under GPLv2-or-later. The spec file license tag (assuming no other pertinent licensing information applies) should be "GPL-2.0-or-later".

The equivalent TOML file LicenseRef-UPX.toml (with status "not-allowed") is also being added to the TOML file directory since some may prefer to view this as a distinct license rather than as a GPL exception for Fedora classification purposes.

This TOML file contains most of the contents of the LICENSE file (some material at the beginning and end is not relevant and has not been copied).

We should change the SPDX expression if SPDX adds the 'ExpressionRef' construct permitting user-defined exceptions to something like 'GPL-2.0-or-later WITH ExceptionRef-UPX'.| link:++https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/blob/main/data/LicenseRef-Geotrans.toml++[LicenseRef-Geotrans] link:++https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-review-process/#_what_is_licenseref++[icon:info-circle[]]

https://github.com/upx/upx/commit/295889023fdf2818b381deb779fe21452cf2988d#diff-8fb22d0484d91bba91b05e1435439d177c03610ec37e59097a15d4c7aeb0f086R943
our understanding is that certain statements in this file (particularly in the "Annotations" section) are not interpretations of and limitations placed on GPLv2 itself but rather explanations of certain requirements embodied in the GPL exception. It is not clear whether these statement are best viewed as a GPL exception (in the orthodox GPL community sense of an additional permission) or as an alternative non-GPL license.

Regardless of whether these statements are seen as a GPL exception or as an alternative license, they should be classified as "not-allowed" for Fedora. However, given the clarifications made by the UPX maintainers, UPX is permitted to be packaged in Fedora under GPLv2-or-later. The spec file license tag (assuming no other pertinent licensing information applies) should be "GPL-2.0-or-later".

The equivalent TOML file LicenseRef-GPL-2.0-or-later_WITH_UPX.toml (with status "not-allowed") is also being added to the TOML file directory since some may prefer to view this as a GPL exception for Fedora classification purposes.

** your GPG key ID,
** your SSH public key,
** your IRC nickname,
** your language preference,
** your timezone,

== Publicly Available Personal Data

In keeping with the open nature and spirit of Fedora, some personal data attached to Fedora accounts is made

If you wish for this information to be kept private, you can opt-out of displaying this information publicly in
your https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Account Preferences]. If you choose to opt-out, Fedora
will still have access to this information, but it will not be displayed to others, and will be considered
Private. The only exception to this is for your email address, which may still be visible in some Fedora
services such as Bugzilla.

== Using (Processing) Your Personal Data

Fedora uses the personal data you provide to:

* create and maintain your accounts;
* identify and authenticate you;
* attribute data and content you produce directly and indirectly in our public-facing services;
* answer your questions;
* send you information;

* for research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is not
used to contact the subjects of the report);

* send you surveys.

We also use this personal data to provide you with information related to your account and the products or
services you acquire from us, to better understand your needs and interests, to improve our service, to
personalize communications, and to comply with or fulfill any contractual obligations to you. It is in Fedora’s
legitimate business interests to provide you with the information, communications, and services you request; to
create a public record of the data and content produced by Fedora’s services; and to maintain the integrity of
that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes.

== Sharing Your Personal Data

Unless you consent, Fedora will never process or share the personal data you provide to us except as described
below.

Fedora may share your personal data with third parties under any of the following circumstances:

* Your publicly available personal data in the Fedora account system, as described above, is accessible by
anyone unless you, as the account holder, opt out as already described in this Privacy Statement.

* As required to provide service, and for e-mail housing (as a consequence of uses already described in this
Privacy Statement). It is in Fedora’s legitimate business interest to provide all users an accurate record of
data and content provided by Fedora’s services, and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for
historical, scientific, and research purposes. This data and content may include but is not limited to email,
code changes, comments, and artifacts.

* As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent
fraud).

* For research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is used
to describe our services and is not used to contact the subjects of the report).

== Receiving E-Mail

Fedora may send you e-mail about your account, to inform you of important upcoming Fedora events (e.g.
elections), or in response to your questions. For your protection, Fedora may contact you in the event that we
find an issue that requires your immediate attention. Fedora processes your personal data in these cases to
fulfill and comply with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have requested, and to
ensure the security of your account.

== Cookies and Other Browser Information

Fedora's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with
our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services.
Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in order to provide you data and content from
our services as quickly as possible. It is in Fedora’s legitimate business interest to maximize the efficiency
and effectiveness of its services for all users.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Fedora uses cookies to store and
sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of fedoraproject.org where you are prompted
to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to:

* Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.

* Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing Fedora is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.

* Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. When a Fedora hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the person's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.

* Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Fedora's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on fedoraproject.org a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it
always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that
the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the
performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to
enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit”
facility).

== Our Commitment to Data Security

Fedora trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our
partners. Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you
send your personal information on our website. In addition, Fedora and its partners enter into confidentiality
agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your
personal data.

== Public Forums Reminder

Fedora often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards, and/or news groups available to its
users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.
Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage
free expression, Fedora reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas,
such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in Fedora’s legitimate business interests
to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and
uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and
to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and
propagation of open source software.

== Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy

Out of special concern for children's privacy, Fedora does not knowingly accept online personal information
from children under the age of 13. Fedora does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become
registered members of our sites. Fedora does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about
children under 13.

In the event that Fedora ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of
13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children
under 13. In addition, Fedora will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents
to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access
to any other information as required by law.

== About Links to Other Sites

This site contains links to other sites. Fedora does not control the information collection of sites that can be reached through links from fedoraproject.org. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact those sites directly.

== Your Rights and Choices in the EEA

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal
data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the
following rights, subject to some limitations, against Fedora:

* The right to access your personal data;
* The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;
* The right to erase your personal data;
* The right to restrict our use of your personal data;
* The right to object to our use of your personal data;

* The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also
known as the right of data portability); and

* The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so via our https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr[Personal
Data Request Form]. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal
data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to Fedora, you may do so via our
https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr[Personal Data Request Form]. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect
the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

== How to Access, Modify or Update Your Information

Fedora gives you the ability to access, modify or update your personal data at any time. You may
https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[log in] and make changes to your login information (change your
password), your contact information, your general preferences and your personalization settings. If necessary,
you may also contact us and describe the changes you want made to the personal data you have previously
provided using the https://pagure.io/fedora-pdr[Personal Data Request Form].

If you wish to remove your personal data from Fedora, you may contact us using the Personal Data Requests Form
and request that we remove this information from the Fedora Account System. Other locations where you may have
used your personal data as an identifier (e.g. Bugzilla comments, list postings in the archives, wiki change
history, and spec changelogs) will not be altered.

= Fedora trademark guidelines

== Subject of the Guidelines

The Fedora Trademark Guidelines (“Guidelines”) cover all registered and unregistered trademarks related to the Fedora Project, including Fedora®, the Fedora logo, Fedora Remix, and the Fedora Remix logo, Fedora Ready and the Fedora Ready logo, either separately or in combination, (the "Fedora Trademarks"). Red Hat retains and reserves all rights to the Fedora Trademarks and their use, including the right to modify these guidelines.

The overarching principle for these Guidelines is that you may not use the Fedora Trademarks or any confusingly similar mark in a manner that might cause confusion or mislead anyone, either directly or by omission. If your use seems to be permitted, but there is nevertheless the possibility that someone will mistake what your relationship is to the Fedora Project or Red Hat, you cannot use the Fedora Trademark in that way. In these Guidelines, we are not trying to limit the lawful use of the Fedora Trademarks, including their “fair use,” but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters of lawful use to be.

Nothing in these Guidelines is meant to limit your rights under the terms of a free and open source software license. Trademarks and copyright are different rights, so regardless of what rights or permissions you may or may not have to use the Fedora Trademarks, you always have all your rights under any applicable free and open source software licenses.

== Use by Red Hat
Red Hat protects the Fedora Trademarks on behalf of the entire Fedora community. The law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of confusingly similar names by third parties. As the trademark owner, Red Hat uses the Fedora Trademarks under the same guidelines as the rest of the community.

== The Fedora Council

Red Hat enlists the assistance of the Fedora Council ( "Council") to oversee the Guidelines to ensure compliance by the community. The Council may grant permission for uses as explained below. The Council serves as the first line of mediation when questions of use arise.

== Usage That Requires Permission
Without separate permission from the Council you cannot:

* Use the Fedora Trademarks in a way that expresses or implies sponsorship or endorsement by, or affiliation or a relationship with the Fedora Project or Red Hat when one does not exist.
* Use Fedora Trademarks on any merchandise, swag, or non-software goods.
* Use terminology that states or implies that the Fedora Project or Red Hat assumes any responsibility for the performance of your products or services.
* Use or register, in whole or in part, the Fedora Trademarks, or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation as part of your own trademark, service mark, company name, trade name, product name, service name, or domain name.
* Use the Fedora Trademarks in a disparaging or inappropriate manner or in any manner that violates any federal, state, or international law or regulation.
* Imitate or copy the Fedora Project’s distinctive trade dress.

== Usage That Does Not Require Permission
Below is some guidance on uses we are commonly asked about. In all cases, use is permitted only provided that:

* the use is only in connection with promoting the Fedora Project or Fedora code, documentation, content, fonts, and firmware (“Fedora Materials”);
* the use is not disparaging to Red Hat, the Fedora Project or their products;
* the use is appropriate for the mark used, for example, "Fedora Remix" is used only for remix products and no other Fedora Trademarks are used for remix products;
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by the Fedora Project or Red Hat;
proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use; and
* the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards] are strictly observed.

=== Community sites and accounts
Fedora defines community sites and accounts as sites or accounts related to the Fedora Project, but not officially maintained by Marketing team members or Social Media administrators. They may be region or country specific and are usually run by an individual contributor or group of contributors. These sites are non-commercial in nature (they are not selling a product).

Examples of these pages include (but are not limited to):

* placing the Fedora Trademarks on a personal website or blog to support the Fedora Project;
* making or running a group or account on a social networking web service to support the Fedora Project; or
* linking to the Fedora Project from a website to provide information or show support for the Fedora Project.

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on community sites and accounts to show your support for the Fedora Project, provided that:

* use of any Fedora logo hyperlinks to the Fedora Project website, https://fedoraproject.org/, or if that is not possible, the site includes a prominent link to the Fedora Project website at https://fedoraproject.org/.
* the site indicates clearly that it is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Fedora Project; in addition:
** the site must include the text "This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Fedora Project" prominently on any page that includes the Fedora Trademarks;
** if the Fedora Trademarks appear in a page header or any area that is designed to be presented on more than one page, the notice must also be designed to be presented on all of those pages as well. (i.e., if the Fedora Trademarks appear in a site-wide header, the informational text must appear in that header or an identically site-wide footer.); and
** the site does not use the Fedora Project’s trade dress (i.e. the look and feel of the Fedora Project).

While these online community sites and accounts are not officially endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, because they are part of the Fedora Community (and use the Fedora trademarks to identify themselves), their site owners, moderators, administrators, and users are required to comply with the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/[Fedora Code of Conduct]. Community sites and accounts which are unable to meet this standard of conduct will be required to cease use of the Fedora Trademarks.

[[business-websites]]
=== Business websites
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on business websites, provided that:

* the website has non-Fedora primary branding;
* use of any Fedora logo hyperlinks to the Fedora Project website, https://fedoraproject.org/, or if that is not possible, the site includes a prominent link to the Fedora Project website at https://fedoraproject.org/;
* no Fedora Trademarks are used as part of the domain name;
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the Fedora Project; and
* the site does not use the Fedora Project’s trade dress.

Provided these guidelines are observed, it is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks to sell Fedora Materials, and to advertise services for Fedora-based systems (installation, configuration, troubleshooting, etc.).

=== Business cards
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission on business cards to accurately identify one's affiliation with the Fedora Project.

=== Promotional events
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission to promote free and open source software events where individuals of the Fedora Project appear as Fedora representatives, distribute Fedora Materials, or otherwise represent the Fedora Project, provided the Fedora Code of Conduct and  the general guidelines above are followed. If you would like to make some merchandise or swag to give away at the event and don't already have a license to do so, please contact the Fedora Council.

=== Publications
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks in the title and content of a publication, provided that:

* the use is clearly in reference to the Fedora Project or Fedora Materials;
* the use does not suggest that the Fedora Project has published, endorsed, sponsored, or agrees with your work;
* the use does not purport to represent Fedora Project contributors as a group without permission from the Council; and
* proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use below.

=== Distributing Fedora Materials
==== Copies of unmodified Fedora Materials
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission to label unmodified Fedora Materials, provided proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement appears as explained in Proper Trademark Use below.

==== Distributing combinations of Fedora Materials with non-Fedora or modified Fedora Materials
Community members may use the Fedora Remix Trademarks on and in conjunction with software that commingles unmodified Fedora Materials with other software or content that is not provided officially by the Fedora Project, or that provides modified Fedora Materials, provided that:

* the fedora-logos, fedora-release, and fedora-release-notes RPM packages are removed, although you may replace these with packages of your own devising not containing the Fedora Trademarks; and
* a notice is prominently displayed indicating that:
** the software provided is not provided or supported by the Fedora Project; and
** official Fedora Materials are available through the Fedora Project website, and linking to the Fedora Project website at https://fedoraproject.org/.

==== OEM pre-loads of unmodified Fedora Materials
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission in connection with the provision and sale of computer systems pre-loaded with Fedora Materials, provided that:

* any website advertising such systems follows the guidelines herein pertaining to <<business-websites>>;
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by the Fedora Project or Red Hat;
* it is clear to the consumer of the computer system that there is no support available from the Fedora community other than that which is offered to all users;
* the use of the Fedora Trademarks does not imply an association with or endorsement of any non-Fedora goods or services;
* any non-Fedora Materials included as part of the install image must reside entirely within a single folder under /opt (e.g. /opt/VENDORNAME). Please note that this exception only applies to content and documentation, not code, fonts or firmware;
* proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use below; and
* the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards] are strictly observed.

==== Virtual images or appliances with unmodified Fedora Materials
It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission in connection with the provision and sale of virtual images or appliance distributions pre-loaded with Fedora Materials, provided that:

* any website advertising such systems follows the guidelines herein pertaining to <<business-websites>>;
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the Fedora Project;
* it is clear to the consumer of the computer system that there is no support available from the Fedora community other than that which is offered to all users;
* the use of the Fedora Trademarks does not imply an association with or endorsement of any non-Fedora goods or services;
* no non-Fedora Materials are pre-installed in the virtual image or appliance files in which the Fedora operating system is pre-loaded, but instead are provided by separate distribution. This requirement does not include minor, nonmaterial changes necessary to run in the particular hosting environment;
* proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Fedora Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use below; and
the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards] are strictly observed.

== Secondary Marks

=== Fedora Remix
Downstream distributors may use the Fedora Remix word mark and the Fedora Remix logo (“Fedora Remix Trademarks”) to indicate their work includes or is derived from Fedora Materials, and thereby drive more interest in the Fedora Project itself, so long as:

* a statement is included in a prominent location stating that end users are receiving modified Fedora Materials, and informing them where they can get unmodified Fedora Materials;
* your name or company name and brand is more prominently featured than the Fedora Remix Trademarks;
use does not express or imply sponsorship or endorsement by, or affiliation or a relationship with the Fedora Project; and
* the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards] are strictly observed.

Other uses that do not properly indicate the work contains modified Fedora Material or non-Fedora material are not permitted. Other uses of any Fedora Trademarks to refer to work that includes or is derived from Fedora Materials are not permitted.

=== Fedora Ready
Fedora Ready word mark and the Fedora Ready logo (“Fedora Ready Trademarks”) allow  approved, current members of the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/marketing/ready/[Fedora Ready program] to promote and advertise their participation in the program.

Approved, current members of the Fedora Ready program may use the Fedora Ready Trademarks in marketing, websites and social media so long as:

* your name or company name and brand is more prominently featured than the Fedora Remix Trademarks;
* use does not express or imply sponsorship or endorsement by, or affiliation or a relationship with the Fedora Project;
* you are a member in good standing of the Fedora Ready program and in compliance with all Fedora Ready program requirements; and
* the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards] are strictly observed.

Permanently affixing the Fedora Ready trademark to hardware or using the Fedora Ready trademarks on merchandise or other promotional items requires permission from the Council.


== Proper Trademark Use
* Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun. Don't use a trademark as a verb. Don't use "a" or "the" to refer to an instance of the trademark.
* Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling and never abbreviate, hyphenate, or combine trademarks with any other words or designs.
* Always distinguish trademarks from the surrounding text, either by capitalizing, bolding, italicizing, or underlining the trademark.
* Don’t pluralize a trademark. Don't use a trademark as a possessive.
* Don’t create acronyms using the Fedora Trademarks.
* Don’t alter, modify, abbreviate, or make variations of the Fedora Trademarks.
* Put the following notice in the footer of the page where you have used a Fedora Trademark Mark (or, if in a book, on the credits page), on any packaging or labeling, and on advertising or marketing materials: "[List of marks] is/are [a] trademark[s] or registered trademark[s] of Red Hat, Inc., or its subsidiaries in the United States and other countries."
* In the case of a registered trademark, the first or most prominent mention of the Fedora Trademark on a web page, document, packaging, or documentation must be accompanied by a symbol indicating the Fedora Trademark is registered ("®").

=== Logo Usage Guidelines
For more information about the requirements for logo size, appearance, placement, and other considerations, refer to the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/brand/[Fedora brand standards].
