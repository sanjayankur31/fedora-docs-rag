A CommOps Working Group focused on the governance and user experience of Fedora's presence on the Matrix platform.
This group concentrates on establishing policy, developing best practices, and providing support for Fedora's Matrix spaces and moderation teams, rather than directly executing all moderation tasks.


[[scope]]

The primary goals of this working group are to:

* Establish clear guidelines and policies for the creation, moderation, and maintenance of official `fedoraproject.org` Matrix rooms.
* Provide support and resources to Matrix room admins and moderators.
* Develop best practices for moderation, including tools and techniques to address abuse and ensure a safe environment.
* Facilitate communication and collaboration between Matrix room admins and moderators.
* Collaborate with the CommOps team to align Matrix governance with broader Fedora communication strategies.
* Improve the overall user experience within Fedora's Matrix presence.


[[responsibilities]]

The working group has the following responsibilities:

* Define the criteria for a Matrix room to be considered an official `fedoraproject.org` room.
* Develop and maintain documentation for Matrix room governance and moderation practices.
* Define and document the process for nominating and approving Matrix room admins and moderators.
* Evaluate and recommend tools and methods for abuse prevention and moderation support.
* Organize regular meetings for Matrix room admins and moderators to discuss issues, share best practices, and facilitate support.
* Coordinate with the CommOps team on communication strategies and support needs.
* Identify and recommend potential improvements to Matrix chat bots used by the community.
* Facilitate communication and collaboration primarily with other Fedora Project teams, Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and Working Groups regarding Matrix usage, governance, and best practices.
* Engage with external open source communities on shared moderation tools or common challenges when beneficial for Fedora.


[[membership]]

The working group includes participants from the following groups:

* Representatives from the CommOps team.
* Active Matrix room admins and moderators for official Fedora spaces.
* Representatives from the Fedora Infrastructure team.
* Other interested Fedora contributors.

Contributors interested in participating are encouraged to join the discussions in the `#commops:fedoraproject.org` room and attend CommOps Team meetings.


[[operating-procedures]]

* The working group uses the xref:council::index.adoc#decisions[lazy consensus model] for its internal decisions.
* The working group uses the `#commops:fedoraproject.org` Matrix room for its discussions.
* The working group uses the CommOps Team repository at https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home to manage tasks and track progress.


[[meetings]]

The Matrix WG meets as a part of the CommOps Team meetings.
The CommOps Team meetings alternate between video conferences and text-based sessions on Matrix, resulting in approximately one video meeting and one text-based meeting per month.
Meeting schedules are announced in the `#commops:fedoraproject.org` Matrix room.


[[commops]]

* This working group operates under the umbrella of the Fedora Community Operations (CommOps) team.
* It aligns its activities with CommOps' goals to improve communication and community health.
* CommOps provides guidance and support to the working group.
* Design Assets

Fedora Ambassadors are representatives of the Fedora Project. Ambassadors ensure the public understand Fedora Project’s principles and the community’s work. Additionally, Ambassadors are responsible for helping to grow the contributor base and to act as a liaison between other FLOSS projects and the Fedora community. You can still represent Fedora in public without being an Ambassador. In this case, you are a https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/advocate/[Fedora Advocate]
Ambassadors give a face and a name to Fedora. Fedora can be big and scary, but Ambassadors will help make sure that one person finds their way through all the confusion into the place where they can contribute.
Ambassadors are the glue. They help connect different people in different parts of the Project because they always deal with people whose interests are diverse.

The primary responsibility of Ambassadors is to ensure the Fedora updates are being broadcasted to the public and collect feedback from users and contributors. Ambassadors should share their input at the Mindshare Committee through their representative there.

* Organize Fedora’s participation at events (sessions, info booths, hand out swag, etc.)

* Onboard new contributors and users

* Organize release parties and install fests

* Talk about the Fedora Four Foundations

* Regularly check up on other Ambassadors to ensure others are doing good and provide assistance

* Promote FLOSS and open source projects

* Demonstrate Fedora and other open source projects to the public

* Promote Fedora at local user groups with talks etc.

*  You give a face and a name to Fedora. You are a person, friendly and approachable. Fedora can be big and scary, but you are going to help make sure that one person finds their way through all the confusion into the place where they can contribute.

*  You are the glue. You help connect different people in different parts of the Project because you are always dealing with people whose interests are different. You should be eager and happy to work with other parts of Fedora to solve problems.

* People are the key. Everything that we do – events, budgets, swag, membership verifications, blogging – it’s all done as an attempt to make personal connections with folks who either want to use or contribute to Fedora. Places, where Ambassadors get together, are one of the few times that Fedora contributors have an opportunity to meet face to face (other than FUDCons and FADs).

* You are the expert in your region. You understand the culture, the needs, and the best ways to communicate about Fedora and FOSS in your region. FAmSCo and other “leaders” in Fedora work for you, and need to listen to what you are saying makes sense. We can’t ignore the global picture, but we need to be flexible in adapting to local needs.


Write a post on the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/ambassadors[Ambassador Discourse] topic and let the team know that you are ready to step down as an Ambassador and move to the Ambassador Emeritus group. If you have set tasks/responsibilities related to Ambassadors, ensure that you have a successor in place.


Write a post on the Ambassador discourse to express your interest in returning. Join the next Monthly Ambassador call and raise your discourse thread. If you took a short break, and there are no objections, you can expect to be added back to the Ambassador group shortly. If you took a longer break, we would suggest finding a mentor and getting a short refresher before returning. Ambassador Rep to Mindshare, the FCAIC, and representatives from FAMSCo will look at the request and make final approval.


The Fedora Code of Conduct apply to everyone in the Fedora community, and especially to you as a Fedora Ambassador.

When acting as ambassador, you don’t just represent yourself, you represent the Fedora Project. When people think of you, they will think of the Fedora Project. This means that there are some important rules to follow, and giving the right impression is important setting aside personal biases in favor of goodwill for yourself and for Fedora.


As an ambassador, and as part of the Marketing project, you need to know the good word of Fedora, and know the differences between it and its cousin, Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Make sure to focuses on the strengths of Fedora, do not insult any other project or product.


Remember, you are not allowed to publish any monetary details or funding requests on fedoraproject.org. You are not authorized to collect funds on behalf of the Fedora Project or for any Fedora-related venture.


Always be aware of the Trademark Guidelines for the Fedora trademarks. They protect the Fedora brand. You should also respect the logo guidelines. As an ambassador, you should be especially careful not to violate these guidelines.


You should not direct people to software that may violate the law. Review and understand our Forbidden items. You can direct users to third-party software, but do not lead users to software that may violate the law or copyrights. When you direct someone to third-party software, please make it clear that use of the software is not supported or encouraged by the Fedora Project.


This is pretty simple. You represent the Fedora Project, which is sponsored by Red Hat. You do not represent Red Hat. If someone is interested in Red Hat specific details or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please put them in touch with the Fedora Project Leader. Even though you may believe that Fedora is perfection, you should not insult any other project or product.


The Fedora brand is independent, and stand-alone, and it’s important to Fedora’s marketing efforts that we maintain that distinction. When representing Fedora in person, try not to confuse people by wearing Red Hat, or any other distribution, clothing or apparel.

Our founding organization and main sponsor, Red Hat, has specifically requested that we not connect hats, red in color or otherwise, to the Fedora Project. Please do not use a hat, whether it’s a fedora or any other type of hat, in any presentation of Fedora or to represent the Fedora Project in any way.


As an Ambassador you are representing the Fedora Project, which may include virtual spaces. In any virtual space that you are representing yourself as a Fedora representative you need to adhere to Fedora’s Code of Conduct.


Inevitably, things happen, and they aren’t always great. If you need help or something goes wrong, make sure to reach out to any local event coordinators, or group leads, and also communicate the situation to the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator.


The main responsibility of Ambassadors is to ensure the Fedora updates are being broadcasted to the public and collect feedback from users and contributors. Ambassadors should share their feedback at the Mindshare Committee through their representative at the Mindshare Committee.

Do you think you might want to be a Fedora Ambassador?

Here is some of what you can expect:



* You give a face and a name to Fedora. You are a person, friendly and approachable.
Fedora can be big and scary, but you are going to help make sure that _one person_ finds their way through all the confusion into the place where they can contribute.

* You are the glue. You help connect different people in different parts of the Project because you are always dealing with people whose interests are different. You should be eager and happy to work with other parts of Fedora to solve problems.

* People are the key. Everything that we do -- events, budgets, swag, membership verifications, blogging -- it's all done as an attempt to make personal connections with folks who either want to use or contribute to Fedora. Places, where Ambassadors get together, are one of the few times that Fedora contributors have an opportunity to meet face to face (other than FUDCons and FADs).

* You are the expert in your region. You understand the culture, the needs, and the best ways to communicate about Fedora and FOSS in your region. Mindshare and other "leaders" in Fedora _work for you_, and need to listen to the needs of the local Fedora communities. We can't ignore the global picture, but we need to be flexible in adapting to local needs.




To become a official Fedora Ambassador, there are a few steps you need to complete.




[IMPORTANT]

.Requires CLA+1 status to complete
====
To edit the wiki, you now have to have CLA+1 status (which means you belong to at least one other group in FAS than the CLA-related groups).If you are unable to edit the wiki, skip this step and work with your mentor on a temporary workaround. Once
you have CLA+1 status, make sure to create a user wiki page. To learn
more about the Fedora CLA, visit this https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Licenses/CLA[page].
====


Creating your user page lets you introduce yourself to the Fedora
community. These pages let you collect useful information, like your
email, your real name, or your IRC nick, in a public place so that
others may contact you. Your user page is your own space, so feel free
to make it look as you wish. Here's what you'll need to do to create

Your user page:



* Go to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Special:MyPage[your user page].

**  Click create, at the top, to start editing your user page. If you've
already created a user page, click edit.

** Write your introduction in the textbox. Your introduction can contain
whatever you'd like, butplease have an English translation.

** When you're finished writing,click Save page.



Here's some ideas on what you can include in your introduction:



* Email address

* Homepage or blog

* Fedora Badges

* IRC channels you're typically in

* Pictures, headings*

* What you do, or would like to do, in the Fedora Project

[TIP]
====
While a wiki user page can be created with just plain text, you'll
likely want to add some headings, bold text, or a picture. These can all
be added using markup. Every page on this wiki is made of this markup,
so you can use any of them as an example. Learn more about wiki syntax
and markup https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Help:Wikisyntaxandmarkup[here]
====



If you're interested in examples, this user page template provides a
basic layout that you can copy. You can also look at the markup for
other users' pages. Here's a selection of some that have stood out:



* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bcotton[Ben Cotton]

* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Siddharthvipul1[Vipul Siddharth]

* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Duffy[Máirín Duffy]

* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jonatoni[Jona Azizaj]




As an Ambassador, you'll be asked about numerous parts of the Fedora
Project. You don't need to have all the answers, but you need general
familiarity with Fedora Project, and you'll need to know how to find answers.
You're most likely well versed in your area of interest, but there is a
lot happening in Fedora.



* Login to and explore
https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[discussion.fedoraproject.org].
Follow the #ambassor & #mindshare tags

* Read the

** Here are possible
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help?rd=Communicate#Contributors_Mailing_Lists[lists
to join].

** You will be asked to join the ambassadors list later on in this process.

* Join and observe in a variety of the Fedora chat channels from your chat platform of choice.

** Element/matrix is the recommended chat platform, learn more https://element.io/[here].

** #fedora-ambassadors is recommended, but a full list can be found https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help?rd=Communicate#IRC[here]






* Subscribe to https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/ambassadors.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Ambassadors Mailing List].


[NOTE]

====
There are a lot of people on the list, so make sure your mail is
relevant to the broader Ambassador audience. Please keep the discussion
focused on Fedora Ambassadors and save any introductions for chat
channels. This includes invites to social-networking sites, technical
support questions or advice, or anything else which is not Fedora
ambassador related.
====






A Mentor is your partner to get sponsored!



Mentors are experienced Ambassadors who can help you quickly become
acclimated to the work expected of Ambassadors as well as ensuring that
Ambassadors within Fedora do an acceptable job of representing Fedora.



[NOTE]
====
* Most mentors have full time jobs, families, and many responsibilities
within Fedora. Please be patient and do not expect an immediate reply.

* Mentors do not initiate contact, please contact a mentor to see if
they can support your Ambassadorship.

* Please note that even if you contact a mentor, they may already have
enough current obligations that they are committed to. In that case,
they may decline, and you should try to find a different mentor.
====



Finding a Mentor:

* Join our Ambassador Monthly Calls.
* If you already have potential mentor. Please contact the Mentor via email and introduce yourself. This email will help the Mentor understand your interest in Fedora Ambassador.
* You can also talk to them at a conference or virtual event to establish a rappot, which can help you break the ice



Please include the following information:
* Your main purpose for joining the Fedora Ambassadors.

** Note: The mentor may ask you to expand upon this if it's incomplete, or seems inconsistent with the goals of the Fedora Ambassadors.

* A link to your Fedora User wiki page

* A bit of information about what you have done so far to promote Fedora amongst your peers/friends.






Confirm you completed the following steps to become a Fedora Ambassador:



. Create User Wiki Page

. Explore the Fedora Project

. Subscribe to the Ambassadors mailing list

. Find a mentor



Once you have verified the steps above, the approval process below will then begin. The approval process can take 60-90 days on average.

If an Ambassador candidate is actively contributing to another Team within Fedora, their mentorship period may be shortened.

Approval process After you have completed all of the above steps, your mentor will approve and sponsor your membership to the Ambassador Group in FAS. Once you're official, https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/welcome-new-ambassadors/39224[comment] on the "Welcome New Ambassadors"
thread on Discussion.fedoraproject.org.


Ambassadors Emeritus are people who held ambassador position for at least one full year and leave the Ambassador role in good standing.

The Emeritus title is to publicly recognize them as former Ambassador and to thank them for contributing to the Fedora Project.

These can also be ambassadors who want to take a step back from the ambassador’s responsibility for a while to focus on their personal lives,
work or to avoid burnout.


Life happens, things get busy, and interests change. This is a natural part of life that we embrace in the Fedora community. Whether you are moving to a new team in Fedora or taking a break altogether, it is important to have an avenue to retire. https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/ambassadors/[Ambassador team members] looking to retire should send an email to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/ambassadors.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Ambassador Mailing List] with a retirement message- it doesn’t have to be long (or it can be!) to let your teammates know you will be retiring or taking a break. This gives everyone a chance to thank you for all your efforts in the Ambassador Program!

The CommOps Team will also run a yearly group cleanup. This entails running a script to search for inactive users(Fedora Account System) and reaching out to them directly via their Fedora Project email. It is absolutely fine to respond to this as “I want to stay involved” or “I will be back soon” or “I am unable to be a part at this time”.



Just like the first time you joined Fedora, you are always welcomed to come back and join. Same as the first time you joined the Ambassadors group, you should create a thread at the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/ambassadors[Ambassadors Disc.] in order to express your interest to come back, give a brief explanation of the reason that made you retire (no personal details are required!) and share some ideas about how you can help the community. If you have been away for a long time and you would like some “Fedora orientation”, don’t forget to mention that as well.

In the meantime, you can check what the rest of the community is up to by reading the Mailing Lists’ archives, checking Fedora social media accounts, check Fedora Discussion, have a look at the Fedora repos in order to see what the community is currently working on. Don’t hesitate to participate in all the above by providing your assistance when help is needed or by simply joining that discussion.

This article historically describes the Community Operations Team charter that guided the team from 2015 until 2020.
// Article content last reviewed and verified by a human on…
2024-07-15

From its founding in 2015 until its pause in 2020, the Community Ops Team focused on a few key areas, both technical and non-technical.

[[culture]]

The Fedora Project builds and ships a Linux distribution, but there is a community behind the technical work and planning.
In Fedora, we have the xref:project::index.adoc#_what_is_fedora_all_about[Four Foundations] to represent our community culture.
The Fedora community represents a set of ethics and values to how we build our distribution.
These ethics and values create the culture of the Fedora Project.
When working in the community, mindfulness of this culture enriches and supports the different sub-communities inside of Fedora.

CommOps builds community infrastructure of support and acceptance for the Fedora community's culture.
The _Friends_ foundation is there for a reason.
The community infrastructure CommOps assists with builds on top of the _Friends_ foundation.
People enjoy contributing in a community where they feel valued for who they are and what they bring to the community, not just that they are useful.
CommOps supports this through some of our tasks relating to culture.

Examples of things we help with to build and support the culture of the Fedora community:

* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/17[Interviewing Fedora community members]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/110[Fedora Appreciation Week]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/138[Top Badgers of the Year]


[[elections]]

There are a few elected bodies in Fedora: the xref:project::leadership.adoc[Fedora Council], xref:mindshare::index.adoc[Mindshare Committee], and xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo].
Every new Fedora release, the community holds elections for these bodies.
Each election takes "wrangling" work to pull it together.
This includes calling for nominations, conducting interviews with candidates, and raising awareness during the voting window.

CommOps supports the xref:council::fpgm.adoc[Fedora Program Manager] in organizing and executing elections.
These responsibilities consist of curating content on the xref:community-blog.adoc[Community Blog], creating interview templates, and outreach to grow awareness.

Examples of things we do to help organize and execute Fedora elections:

* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/7[Fedora Elections and CommOps Coverage]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/19[Improve automation of Elections communication]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/93[Better explain roles of Council and FESCo]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/107[Automated Fedocal reminders to send to all mailing lists for upcoming Elections]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/112[Create August 2017 election interview templates for candidates]


[[storytelling]]

Messaging and storytelling bring the Fedora Project "story" to both contributors and user communities.
Every year, a https://mattdm.org/fedora/2018flock/2018-State-of-Fedora.pdf[couple thousand people] work on Fedora.
Messaging is a way of sharing our story in multiple formats.
We bring the message of what we _as a community_ are doing out to others.
Others include our contributors working in other areas of the project and users interested in what the Fedora community produces.
When we share our story with each other, we are aware of other work happening in the Fedora community.
Communicating the story of Fedora keeps our contributors moving together towards our goals.
Good messaging helps our users better understand the goals and objectives of Fedora and how we plan to get there.

CommOps supports messaging by working with other sub-projects and teams to tell their own stories.
CommOps provides help to "dig out" the stories and tools to share them widely.
This includes tasks like interviews, sharing activities by Fedora contributors, running retrospectives, and more.
These tasks keep contributors in sync with what we're working on.
They are direct actions to keep everyone on the same page.

Examples of things we do to support messaging and tell stories:

* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/4[Interviews about goals for team sprints]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/66[Call for nominations of a Working Group]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/98[Covering upcoming talks by Fedora contributors at a major conference]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/100["Help Wanted" columns]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/129[Year in Review blog series]


[[metrics]]

CommOps measures community health and engagement through extensive metrics and data available about Fedora.
{url_fedmsg}[fedmsg] is a messaging bus with data about activity in the Fedora community.
The data includes activity like git commits, new blog posts, wiki page edits, software build status, IRC meeting notes, and more.
CommOps works with fedmsg to tell stories about our community, but specific types of stories.
The stories told with metrics are helpful to understand what we may be doing right or wrong.
It gives us a data-driven way to understand our huge community.

CommOps directly supports metrics in Fedora through development time and data-driven storytelling.
Some members develop existing software or build new scripts to analyze data.
Others use the data to write reports or studies on how the Fedora community works.
Ultimately, metrics are a largely technical area that CommOps helps with.

Examples of metrics work and data-driven storytelling we do:

* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/32[Analyzing Fedora contributor activity]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/88[Fedora release party metrics]
* https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/109[Understanding contributor activity by geographic location]

There are two representatives from the CommOps structure to Mindshare. Ideally, this would be one Ambassador representative and one representative from CommOps. These people are responsible for representing Ambassadors/CommOps as a collective to the Mindshare Committee and not as a single voice. They will be required to work with all the various groups that collaborate with Mindshare and act as a liaison between these groups and CommOps. These roles will require a fair amount of time investment and good communication skills.

* Nick Bebout (nb) [Ambassador Rep]
* Alberto Rodríguez Sánchez (bt0dotninja) [CommOps Rep]

Representatives are a crucial point to keep communication flowing between CommOps, Ambassadors, and Mindshare. As a CommOps/Ambassador representative to Mindshare you will be involved with:

* Participate in weekly meetings at #fedora-mindshare https://libera.chat/[IRC channel].
* Review and comment on tickets in the mindshare https://pagure.io/mindshare[Pagure repo].
* Work closely and collaborate with the other outreach teams’ representatives to ensure that the most effective decisions are made.
* Give valuable feedback to the Mindshare Committee.
* Share the best practices: one of the Mindshare’s goals is to take down barriers or whatever is blocking sharing best practices.
* Ensure that CommOps/Ambassadors are being represented and bring to the Mindshare meetings any problems or obstacles they might encounter.
* Ensure that the Fedora budget is managed in the most effective way across all regions.
* Listen to the needs, concerns and hopes of the Fedora community and relay them to the Mindshare Committee.


The duration of service is two Fedora release cycles, or one year. However, terms may run shorter or longer depending on the personal situation of the persons filling the Representative roles. In an unlikely event of the representative(s), Mindshare Committee, or the CommOps Team wish to make a change in representation, sufficient reasoning must be provided. Following the SOP, a new representative will then be selected by the CommOps Team.

This section explains how the representatives are nominated and selected. The selection process documented below is initiated when a rotation of representatives is motioned by the existing representative, the Mindshare committee, or the Fedora Council.

There will be a two-week nomination period for potential representatives. Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated by other members of CommOps/Ambassadors with their consent. Nominees are required to be members of CommOps/Ambassadors and should have a basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects, and have sufficient time to perform the responsibilities required.

In the event that there are no nominees, Commops/Ambassadors will work with the Mindshare Committee to broaden the search message and request more time. Should no nominees be found after that, the role will rotate among existing CommOps/Ambassador members until the next representative is identified.

After the one-week nomination period expires, the CommOps teams (including Ambassadors) will discuss candidates in a public meeting. In a meeting discussion, it provides an opportunity for the team to weigh in and share other context. In the event that three or more nominees are interested in the Representative roles, the Fedora CommOps Team will coordinate with the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fpgm/[Fedora Program Manager] to run an election.

For the Fedora Elections application, use these conditions:

* Nominee must be a member of fedora-commops https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/commops/[Fedora Account group]
* Voting is open to CLA+1 voters (like Council elections)

The selected person and the Mindshare Committee will be notified once the selection is confirmed. The selected person will begin serving as the CommOps/Ambassador representative to the Mindshare Committee as soon as possible.

* https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare/[Fedora Mindshare]
* https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/contribute/commops-landing/[CommOps]
* https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/teams/ambassadors/[Ambassadors]
* Various other Outreach teams as required


https://libera.chat/[libera.chat] IRC network has a concept of ‘Groups’ for various projects. Group contacts for each of those groups are granted special powers on the network over their groups channels. Additionally, requests from Group contacts can be taken as ‘official’ requests from the group. Fedora group contacts represent Fedora to libera.chat.

The primary functions of group contacts are:

* Check/process ‘cloak’ requests and request them from libera.chat admins to process. (Cloaks are a hostmask with the project name in them instead of hostname or ip address. It’s a way to note your affiliation with a group)
* To (re)gain and configure control of irc channels in the group namespace “#fedora*”




Group contacts are added from very trusted project members and kept to a small number. Council should approve changes in libera.chat group members. Changes will then be made by libera admins to joining / leaving accounts.


* Process the ‘cloaks’ requests: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/LiberaCloaks as time permits.
* Process requests in the https://pagure.io/irc tracker for matrix bridges or regaining control of a channel in the #fedora* namespace as requested.
* Idle in the #libera-communities channel to make requests to libera admins as needed.


* libera.chat admins in #libera.communities
* Any fedora groups needing irc work

[[vision]]

To foster a transparent, inclusive, and data-informed Fedora community that empowers collaboration, celebrates diversity, and continuously evolves.
We envision a community where contributors, teams, and leaders have the insight, tools, and support needed to sustain a thriving open source ecosystem.


[[mission]]

The {team_name} (CommOps) strengthens the Fedora Project by connecting people, data, and process to create a more resilient, informed, and cohesive community.
Community Operations supports the lifecycle of community collaboration by supporting contributors and sustaining teams through data-driven insights, clear communication, and process excellence.


[[focus-areas]]

* *Community Activities*:
Supporting teams and community projects & initiatives that build contributor engagement and community growth.

* *Moderation & Community Collaboration*:
Partnering with moderation working groups to support a safe, respectful, and inclusive community culture.

* *Data & Analytics*:
Building and maintaining ethical, privacy-conscious analytics that provide visibility into community health, participation, and trends.

* *Events & Outreach*:
Collaborating with event organizers and outreach teams to enhance community experiences, from global conferences and local meetups.

* *Process Improvement & Incubation*:
Experimenting with and incubating new methods, tools, and workflows that improve how Fedora collaborates, communicates, and evolves.


[[goals]]

The following are examples of where the {team_name} focuses:

* Work closely with xref:council::fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect] to prioritize key focus areas
* Assist xref:council::foa.adoc[Fedora Operations Architect] with release preparations
* Support preparation and execution of link:{url_wiki}/Elections[Fedora Elections]
* Work with sub-projects and teams to improve on-boarding methods and practices

[[contact]]

The {team_name} uses a {team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication_name}] forum tag and a {team_synch_communication}[{team_synch_communication_name}] room to communicate.

The {team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication_name} forum tag] is best for _asynchronous_ communication.
This means it is best for questions or topics that someone may respond to later.
It is better for longer, threaded discussions.

The {team_synch_communication_name} room is best for _synchronous_ communication.
This means it is best for quick feedback, like in a conversation.
It is helpful for real-time discussions or getting someone's attention.

{team_asynch_communication_name} forum tag::
{team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication}]

{team_synch_communication_name} room::
link:{team_synch_communication}[`#commops:fedoraproject.org`]


[[workflow]]

The {team_name} uses a ticket-based workflow to keep track of our work.
The repository with tickets is found on link:{team_issue_tracker}[{team_issue_tracker_name}].
Tickets are found under the link:{team_issue_tracker}/-/issues[_Issues_] tab in the sidebar.

Various labels are used to sort and triage GitLab Issues.
For good beginner tasks, look at the link:{team_issue_tracker}/-/issues/++?label_name[]=good%20first%20issue++[_good first issue_] tag.


[[meetings]]

The {team_name} holds meetings every other week to check in on tasks and plan ahead.
This translates to two meetings a month.
One of the meetings is run via a text chat in a Matrix room.
The other meeting is run as an audio/video call.
Check link:{team_meetings}[{team_meetings_name}] for the next meeting date and time.

Past text meeting minutes are recorded in link:{team_meetings_minutes_url}[{team_meetings_minutes_name}].

[[meeting-format]]

* Do you have any experience in open source or online communities?
If so, what?
* What parts of {team_name} were interesting to you?
* Do you have any questions for us?
How can we help _you_ get started?


[[community-blog]]

The Fedora {url_commblog}[Community Blog] is a key component to CommOps.
An account gives permissions to view article drafts and previews before they are published.
If you ever write an article, you will need an account.
To register, log in at the {url_commblog}/wp-login.php[login page] with your Fedora Account System (FAS) credentials.

Need more help logging in?
Read the {url_commblog}/how-to-log-in/[help page] for more detailed instructions.


[[matrix]]

Fedora uses the Matrix protocol for instant messaging and communication.
Our Matrix rooms can be accessed using any Matrix client, but https://element.io/[Element client] and the https://chat.fedoraproject.org/[chat.fedoraproject.org] web app are the most common and easiest ways to get started.
Discussions and planning take place in Matrix channel https://matrix.to/#/#commops:fedoraproject.org[#commops:fedoraproject.org], while our monthly team meetings are held in a meeting room such as https://matrix.to/#/#meeting:fedoraproject.org/[#meeting:fedoraproject.org].

[[first-steps]]

See xref:contribute/first-steps.adoc[Make your first steps in Fedora] for more info.


[[start-task]]

CommOps uses https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops[this GitLab repository] to track our tasks and what we're working on.
Tasks, problems, and goals are filed as tickets in the https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home/-/issues[issue tracker].
There are a lot of tickets, but we're not working on everything at once.
Scrolling through the issue tracker gives a good idea of what CommOps helps with.

Look for the https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=good%20first%20issue[good first issue] tag on tickets to find good tasks for beginners.

Does something look interesting?
Leave a comment if you have a question or want to work on something.
Also check and see if the ticket is assigned to someone.
If it is unassigned, you can start working on it now.
If there is an assignee, ask them if they need help or if they are still working on the ticket.

This provides an opportunity to receive mentorship and get help to start a new task.


[[meetings]]

CommOps has an IRC team meeting each week.
In our meeting, the team discusses items on our agenda and checks in on any progress of current tasks.
Tickets selected for meetings are updated after the meeting with new information.

The meetings are open to the public and anyone can join.
See when our meetings are in your time zone on the https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/commops/[CommOps meeting calendar].
Feel free to attend and introduce yourself during roll call!

[[fasgroup]]

To get updates, and to gain access to different tools in CommOps, you'll need to join our FAS group. To be sponsored as a member of CommOps, raise a issue request in our https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home[repo here] with the following information.
* Your FAS ID
* What areas of Fedora Community Operations are you intersted in (community growth, analytics, engagement, etc)

The issue will be reviwed and after two members of CommOps add a +1 to the issue, you will be added to the FAS group.
Periodically, we may review the list of members in the FAS group and check in if you're still interested in contributing.
Inactive members may be removed after two Fedora Linux releases.


The link:{url_commblog}[Fedora Community Blog] (CommBlog) is a WordPress-based site that delivers news, updates, and calls for help from contributors across Fedora.

image::https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/0/09/Community_Blog_screenshot.png[Community Blog screenshot,90%,90%]


[[content]]

The Community Blog focuses on updates and information about the Fedora Project community.
Topics vary, but mostly include…

* News from specific sub-projects
* Updates on new features or changes in Fedora
* Calls for help from other contributors
* Official {url_wiki}/Elections[Fedora Elections] coverage
* Anything related to Fedora _contributor_ community


[[magazine-vs-community-blog]]

What is the difference between the https://fedoramagazine.org[Fedora Magazine] and the Community Blog?
They focus on two different audiences (or types of readers).

The Fedora Magazine targets everyday Fedora users, Linux enthusiasts, and technology hobbyists.
Fedora contributors are included in these audiences, but they are not the main focus.
The Community Blog is the news hub for Fedora contributors and people working inside of the Fedora community.
The Community Blog specifically focuses on our contributors.

For example, an article on how to use a new package in Fedora is better for the Magazine.
Any Fedora user may be interested in using the package.
An article that announces a new feature to a Fedora Infrastructure service or an Ambassador event report is better for the Community Blog.
A Fedora user may not be interested, but our contributors have a stronger interest.

Sometimes there is some overlap between the two.
Think hard about who you are writing for and who you want to read your article.
This should answer the question of where to write your article.
The CommOps and Fedora Magazine teams are happy to answer any doubts or questions if you are unsure.


[[write-article]]

The Community Blog is managed by the CommOps team.
The system administration is managed by {url_wiki}/Infrastructure[Fedora Infrastructure].
However, we need _your help_ to share the awesome things you and your area of Fedora are working on.

Articles don't need to be long.
Short snippets are useful too.
If you're not sure how much to write, 300 words is a good target.
If needed, you can always write more.

See the link:{url_commblog}/writing-community-blog-article/[_Writing an article_] guide to get started.
This page explains the process for writing and how to get your post published.


[[community-blog-theme]]

The Community Blog WordPress theme is open source.
Find the source code https://pagure.io/communityblog-theme[on Pagure].
Open a ticket if you find a bug, problem, or something to improve.
Pull requests are also welcome!
Before submitting a pull request, post to {team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication_name}] first and ask for feedback on your planned contribution.


[[editors]]

Community Blog editors review article drafts and schedule new posts.
Editors are reachable on {team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication_name}].

Below, you can find a current list of editors:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you federate with the Fedora Planet, understand the guidelines on appropriate material to federate to Fedora Planet.
Read link:{url_wiki}/Planet#Appropriate_Material[these guidelines on appropriate material] before you aggregate your blog.
====


[[prerequisites]]

. Register a Fedora Account System (FAS) account.
. Sign the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA).
. Be a member of at least one other group in the FAS system (also known as FPCA+1).


[[enroll]]

. Configure a category on your blog for content containing link:{url_wiki}/Planet#Appropriate_Material[appropriate material] for Fedora Planet.
(For help with this, xref:#categories[see below].)
. Log into the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Account System].
Navigate to your profile and click _Edit Profile_.
. Find the _RSS URL_ option.
. Paste the URL of your category-specific RSS/RSS2/Atom feed into the option box.

This page provides instructional steps on how to start a Fedora SIG using current communication platforms and tools.

A Fedora Special Interest Group (SIG) is a group of people who share an interest in a specific topic or project within Fedora.
SIGs are easy to start and offer a great way to collaborate and work together on things you are passionate about, such as a new idea, project, or community effort.
This guide will show you the simple steps to create your own SIG using available tools and resources.


[[explore]]

You don’t have to reinvent the wheel!
Other SIGs may already be tackling related ideas or have systems in place that you can learn from.
Reach out and collaborate!

Examples:

* xref:design::index.adoc[*Fedora Design Team*]:
Helpful for logos, visuals, and branding your SIG.
* *xref:fedora-docs::index.adoc[Fedora Docs] or xref:infra::index.adoc[Infrastructure] teams*:
Great for guidance on hosting content or automation tools.


[[build-interest]]

Before creating a SIG, confirm that at least a few other Fedora contributors are interested in the topic.
You can:

* Post on link:{team_asynch_communication}[{team_asynch_communication_name}] (using the appropriate category or tag) and the link:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org//[Fedora devel mailing list].
* Join a relevant {team_synch_communication_name} room and share your ideas.
The Fedora devel mailing list is a good place to start if you are not sure of what group to join.
Many Fedora developers and packagers can be found there.

Your post should clearly explain:

* What your proposed SIG is about
* Why it matters
* How others can get involved

.Example titles
----
“Looking to start a Fedora Edge Computing SIG, anyone interested?”
“Fedora for Students SIG: anyone want to join?”
----


[[basics]]

Once there is enough interest, establish your SIG’s basic footprint in Fedora’s ecosystem.
This helps others find you and contributes to long-term sustainability.

.Required Setup
* Create a tag on {team_asynch_communication_name} (to organize conversations).
* xref:project::communications.adoc#_primary_channels[Request a {team_synch_communication_name} room].
If a related room exists or there isn’t much traffic yet, use the existing room and wait until there’s enough interest to request a new one.
* Create a Forgejo repository or project board (optional but useful for tracking tasks).
* Create a private mailing list for Bugzilla bugs (required for SIGs that maintain packages).

If you are unsure where to start, the xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[Fedora Join SIG] can assist.

[TIP]
====
Create a dedicated {team_asynch_communication_name} tag for your SIG early on.
It helps organize all related topics and makes your group easier to discover.
Drop into community-wide {team_synch_communication_name} rooms like link:++https://matrix.to/#/#social:fedoraproject.org++[`#social:fedoraproject.org`] or link:++https://matrix.to/#/#join:fedoraproject.org++[`#join:fedoraproject.org`] for community social chatter and quick help.
====


[[documentation]]

Create a Fedora Docs site that introduces your SIG.
The Fedora Docs site index page should include:

* The SIG's mission and scope
* A list of communication channels
* Links to resources ({team_asynch_communication_name} tag, {team_synch_communication_name} room, Forgejo repo, etc.)
* How others can join or contribute
* Team leads or go-to people

You may:

* Publish this on the Fedora Docs page (_recommended_)
* Or as part of your Forgejo README

[NOTE]
====
While Fedora Wiki is still in use, SIGs are starting to move their documentation to Fedora Docs.
Fedora Docs are better because they are easier to find information and show up better in search results.
====


[[activities]]

SIGs gain momentum by working together toward shared goals.
Early actions might include:

* Tracking to-do items in a Forgejo issue board
* Organizing an async planning thread in {team_asynch_communication_name}
* Hosting a regular or one-time {team_synch_communication_name} meeting

You can also:

* Submit articles to link:https://fedoramagazine.org/[Fedora Magazine] to promote what your SIG is doing in Fedora
* Share contributor journeys and milestones on the link:{url_commblog}[Community Blog]
* Ping the xref:marketing::index.adoc[Marketing Team] for help with graphics, campaign ideas, and event promotion
* Get community planning and coordination tips from the xref:commops::index.adoc[Community Ops team]
* Reach out to other related SIGs for cross-group support

Further Reading:

* link:https://www.runn.io/blog/asynchronous-meeting/[_How to run good async meetings_]


[[keep-going]]

Successful SIGs grow by being active, inclusive, and goal-driven.
Some tips:

* Review progress regularly (monthly/quarterly) and share public reports on progress.
* Actively welcome and onboard new contributors with documentation for newcomers and/or designated mentors to help onboard new contributors to the community.
* Share your progress publicly via blog posts, social media, local outreach, or mailing list.
* Define leadership roles or points of contact for long-term sustainability.

Need inspiration?
Check out well-run SIGs like xref:fedora-coreos::index.adoc[Fedora CoreOS] for best practices.


[[get-help]]

You are not doing this alone!
Fedora has a helpful, friendly community and lots of places where you can ask questions, get guidance, and find people to work with.

[[how-to-volunteer]]

Interested in helping make Flock a great success?
We'd love to have you!

A specific volunteer sign-up form will be available soon.
This form will be managed by the xref:commops::index.adoc[Fedora Community Operations (CommOps) Team].
Keep an eye on the Flock website and Fedora communication channels for the announcement.

In the meantime, the best way to express interest, stay informed, and ask questions is to join the discussion on Matrix:

* Main conference room:
{matrix-room-flock}[`#flock:fedoraproject.org`]
* Fedora CommOps (for volunteering coordination):
{matrix-room-commops}[`#commops:fedoraproject.org`]

Introduce yourself in the Matrix rooms!
The CommOps team in {matrix-room-commops}[`#commops:fedoraproject.org`] can help direct initial questions about volunteering roles and getting involved.

This document provides instructions for managing the Flock conference website, which was recently redesigned to align with the Fedora website's design language and leverage existing infrastructure, including the CMS, community translations, and a unified navbar.


[[structure]]

The Flock website's content is divided into two primary sections to cater to different user needs:

* *Main page*:
This section provides general information about Flock for new contributors and those unfamiliar with the conference.
* *Year page*:
This section contains specific details about the Flock conference in a specific year.

Each year of Flock will have its dedicated page under the `/flock` directory (e.g., `/flock/2025`, `/flock/2026`, etc.).


[[cms-features]]

Migrating the website to the CMS enabled the implementation of several useful features, including:

* Toggle switches for showing/hiding website sections, allowing for content relevance management.
* Alt text and attribution fields for images, improving accessibility and copyright clarity.


[[issues]]

The following areas require further attention:

* *Call for Proposals (CFP) Section*:
The CFP section within the CMS has been disabled and may contain unresolved issues.
Testing is required before enabling this feature.
* *"Thank You" Section*:
A dedicated "thank you" section for quick activation is currently absent.

Future development will focus on creating a new page for each year of the conference.
The process for adding these pages is described in the following section.
While the CMS supports dynamic page creation, this approach was not used for Flock 2024 to minimize complexity.


[[add-year-page]]

Adding a new year page for a future Flock conference involves modifying both the CMS and the main website repositories.
The process is detailed below:

[[cms-changes]]

. *Fork the CMS Repository*:
Fork the https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/cms/fedoraproject.org/[Fedora websites CMS repository].
. *Copy and Paste Event Data*:
Copy the Flock event data block https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/cms/fedoraproject.org/-/blob/main/public/admin/data/events.yml?ref_type=heads#L421[from the `events.yml` file] (starting around line 421 and ending before the next event block).
Paste this block below the existing Flock event entries.
. *Modify Event Data*:
Update the first three lines of the copied block to reflect the new year (replace `X` with the appropriate year).

+
[source,yaml]
----
label: "Flock 202X"
name: "flock-202X"
file: "/content/events/flock/202X.yml"
----

. *Duplicate Event Content File*:
Navigate to the `/content/events/flock` directory within the repository.
Duplicate the existing year's YAML file (e.g., `2024.yml`) and rename it to match the new year (e.g., `2025.yml`).
. *Commit and Create Merge Request*:
Commit your changes to a new branch and create a merge request to the main CMS repository for review.

[[repo-changes]]

After the CMS changes are merged, the following steps are required to update the website:

. *Fork the Website Repository*:
Fork the https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/[main Fedora websites repository].
. *Duplicate Page File*:
Duplicate the existing year's page file (e.g., `/pages/flock/2024.vue`) and rename it to match the new year (e.g., `/pages/flock/2025.vue`).
. *Update Page File*:
Inside the new page file, modify the second line to point to the new year's CMS data (replace `X` with the appropriate year):

+
[source,javascript]
----
const data = await getCMS("events/flock/202X");
----

. *Commit and Create Merge Request*:
Commit your changes to a new branch and create a merge request to the main website repository.
Ensure this merge request is submitted *after* the CMS merge request to avoid website errors.


[[cms-management]]

Following the above procedures, all other website updates should be manageable directly https://fedora.gitlab.io/websites-apps/fedora-websites/cms/fedoraproject.org/admin/[within the CMS interface].

[abstract]
Thank you for contributing as a reviewer for Flock to Fedora!
Your expertise is vital in shaping an outstanding conference experience.
This guide is designed to streamline your navigation of the Pretalx review process for Flock.

This page provides guidance to call for proposal (CFP) reviewers for the https://fedoraproject.org/flock/[Flock to Fedora] conference.
CFP reviewers are invited as volunteers by Flock core organizers to help curate diverse content and programming at our contributor conference.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your feedback should be constructive, insightful, and focused on the content of the submissions.
Your role plays a significant part in ensuring a high-quality experience for Flock.
====

This guide is organized into multiple sections below.


[[access]]

You will receive an invitation from a Pretalx administrator with login instructions.
You will be prompted to create a reviewer profile if it is your first time.

.Email invitation from Pretalx
image::pretalx-account-invite.png[Screenshot of the email invitation sent by the Pretalx system to the user's email inbox. The email subject reads, "You have been invited to an organiser team".]

.Accepting the invitation on Pretalx
image::pretalx-invite-acceptance.png[Screenshot of the dialogue to accept the email invitation to join a Pretalx team. Two options are presented to accept, to either sign in with an existing account or create a new one.]


[[proposals]]

Upon logging in, your dashboard will display a list of proposals assigned to you for review.
Also note that depending on settings, reviewers will be able to view and review all proposals, or only assigned proposals (determined by the Pretalx administrator).

.Reviewer dashboard in Pretalx
image::pretalx-reviewer-dashboard.png[Screenshot of the reviewer dashboard from Pretalx. Four panes are shown: 5 proposals, 6 submitters, 1 review, and 1 active reviewer.]


[[review]]

A Pretalx proposal submission is typically composed of a title, abstract, track, theme(s), a brief speaker bio, and other notes.
If blind review for reviewers is enabled, speaker identities are hidden.

All reviewers can give *up to four points* to a session.
Each point is weighed on a different criteria, much like a rubric.
The four point categories guide each reviewer to reflect on four different aspects of the proposal:

. *Submission Quality*:
The basics.
Is the proposal well-written?
Is it thoughtful?
Does the speaker adequately describe their topic in a way that others can understand?
. *Theme Relevance*:
All proposals link themselves to one or many of the four themes:
_*Freedom* – The Open Frontier_; _*Friends* – Our Fedora Story_; _*Features* – Engineering Fedora's Core_; _*First* – Blueprint for the Future: Fedora Linux 45 & 46_.
Does the connection between the proposal and theme make sense?
Is it a good fit?
. *Probability of Success*:
Is the speaker adequately prepared to deliver their content?
If they will run a workshop, will it connect to the Flock audience and attendees?
If they present a session, do they have a clear connection to Fedora?
What is the likelihood that this session contributes to something positive for the future of Fedora?
. *Personal Appeal*:
This is your personal point.
Use it however you want!
If there is a session you just _really like_ and you have a hard time explaining why, this point is for you.
Alternatively, if there is something you really don't like, you can also downvote it (although we likely want to know why in the comments).

The following sections explain each point in more detail and provides guidance to CFP reviewers on how to cast a vote.

[[voting-quality]]

* *Give one point (+1)*:
If abstract is written clearly and the submitter did a good job of describing their topics.
It should be clear what the submitter will talk about and why their topic(s) are relevant to the Fedora contributor community.
* *Give no point (+0)*:
They submit an interesting abstract, but there are missing details or uncertainties about what the submitter will prepare.
* *Take one point (-1)*:
The abstract is poorly written and/or it is unclear what the speaker is proposing.

[[voting-themes]]

* *Give one point (+1)*:
The proposal has a clear connection to a Flock 2026 theme.
The submitter acknowledges the focus area in their abstract or describes the connection between the focus area and their topic(s) well.
* *Give no point (+0)*:
The proposal acknowledges a theme, but the submitter does NOT connect the theme and their topic(s) well.
* *Take one point (-1)*:
The proposal does not acknowledge a theme or seems irrelevant to the theme selected by the submitter.

As a reminder, the Flock 2026 themes are below:

* *Freedom – The Open Frontier*:
This theme explores how Fedora pushes the boundaries of technological freedom.
We invite proposals on FOSS approaches to Artificial Intelligence, the advancement of open hardware like RISC-V, the development of open standards, and the protection of data privacy.
Sessions should focus on how our work in the Fedora Project creates a more free and collaborative technological world for everyone.
* *Friends – Our Fedora Story*:
This theme celebrates the people and practices that make our community unique.
We seek proposals that share stories of mentorship, successful team collaboration, and effective onboarding within Fedora.
Collaboration is key to our success, so sessions about our partnerships with other FOSS communities should center on the mutual benefits and the positive impact these relationships have on the Fedora Project.
* *Features – Engineering Fedora's Core*:
As a contributor conference, this theme dives deep into the craft of building our distribution and other Fedora outputs.
We welcome sessions on improvements to our infrastructure, release engineering processes, quality assurance, packaging, and community tooling.
This is the place for technical talks that showcase our engineering excellence and the collaborative work that makes Fedora's deliverables possible, from code to final artifact.
* *First – Blueprint for the Future: Fedora Linux 45 & 46*:
This theme focuses on the near-term innovations that will define the next generation of Linux.
With the next few Fedora Linux releases serving as the foundation for RHEL 11 and EPEL 11, this is a critical time.
We are looking for forward-looking technical talks on the changes, features, and architectural decisions in F45 and F46 that will shape the future of the operating system, from the community desktop to the core of the enterprise platforms.

[[voting-success]]

* *Give one point (+1)*:
You believe that this proposal has a high probability of success at Flock.
The speaker(s) appear to have sufficient knowledge and expertise to present the topic at Flock.
* *Give no point (+0)*:
It is unclear whether the speaker will be able to deliver the content successfully at Flock.
* *Take one point (-1)*:
You believe that this proposal will not be successful at Flock.
This could be because the proposal is too ambitious, it is not relevant to a Fedora contributor audience, or the speaker does not seem to understand the topic they are proposing.

[[voting-appeal]]

* *Give one point (+1)*:
You see _positive_ value for this session to be at Flock, based on your personal involvement with Fedora.
* *Give no point (+0)*:
You see _neutral_ value for this session to be at Flock, based on your personal involvement with Fedora.
* *Take one point (-1)*:
You see _negative_ value for this session to be at Flock, based on your personal involvement with Fedora.

Fedora now uses a new tool called Pretalx to manage Call for Proposals (*_CFPs_*).
This user guide will walk you through setting up your CFP on Pretalx, making the process smooth and efficient.
Whether you are organizing a workshop, a talk session, or any other event that requires submissions, Pretalx will help create a clear and easy-to-follow CFP.

First-time Fedora CFP organizers are the set of people who require this guide.
By following this, a newbie should be able to set up a CFP successfully without getting confused.


[[create]]

As a Pretalx admin, visit the https://cfp.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Pretalx platform] to log in and create a new event.
If you are not an admin, contact existing admins to create your event.

Click on the Pretalx logo which appears in the top left corner of the page.
The Pretalx platform already has a past event, hence, a new event would have to be created by clicking on the “plus sign icon” to set up the appropriate CFP.


[[settings]]

Expand the hamburger menu to view the settings features.

. Click *Settings*, then *General* to edit your event information.
.. *_Optional_*: Add landing page text (the sentence displayed on your form).
. Save any changes you have made.
. Navigate to *Teams* to invite team members.
. Modify other sub-settings within the *Settings* section as needed.
. Other sub-settings under the settings feature can be modified as required.


[[config]]

[[config-content]]

To set up the content for your CFP, navigate to the main CFP feature page and click on *Content*.

. Input a headline and text under the *text and headline* section.
.. This is not compulsory.
However, it gives your CFP a complete feel when people see necessary information about your event.
. Under the proposal information section, there is a list of required information that can be set to one of the following options:
.. Ask and require input
.. Ask but do not require input
.. Do not ask
. These can be selected as needed, and sections not needed can be set to do not ask.
. Once they are edited per the needs of the event, click on the save button.


[[editor]]

Here, you can add custom help texts to individual fields and headlines by clicking on them and editing them to suit the required information you need.

[[editor-questions]]

Add new questions for your form by clicking on *Add a new question*.

.Add a new question in Pretalx
image::pretalx-cfp-editor-add-question.png[Screenshot of the CFP editor, where the "Add a new question" button is shown in the upper-right corner of the screen.]

* Questions can be tailored to suit the speaker, proposal, or reviewer.
These options are seen when the drop-down is clicked on.
A user can also select the kind of question to be asked by clicking on the drop-down and choosing the question types.
E.g, one-line text, multi-line text, choose one from a list, etc.
* A help text that further explains the question being asked can be filled, to provide more guidance to end users of the form.
* When the question variant is set to *choose one from a list* or *choose multiple from a list*, the answer options can be uploaded below, on the questions page.

.Answer options in the Pretalx CFP editor
image::pretalx-cfp-editor-answer-values.png[Screenshot of the Pretalx CFP editor interface. Shown are three text boxes, which represent possible answer choices to a question. The text boxes are filled with three answers, one per box: yes, no, and maybe.]

[TIP]
====
All types of questions relating to the proposal or speaker can be set under the Questions page, using the right-asking formats.
====

[[editor-types]]

These fields are very explanatory.
All that is required from a user would be to add necessary tracks to your event by clicking on *_new track_* or *_new type_* for session types.


[[notes]]

* An admin should run a test session by filling and submitting a sample proposal before sharing the CFP link to participants, to ensure it is properly set up.
* Reviewer settings should also be tested, by ensuring proposals are accurately assigned to a reviewer.
* All proposal and event settings should also be cross-checked to eliminate mistakes.

[[mindshare-planning-flock]]

The xref:council::fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect], Justin W. Wheeler, https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or5n/help-fedora-spend-our-2024-budget[hosted a workshop] with Nick Bebout to brainstorm with the community about what events the Fedora community should plan for in 2024.
The sections below capture feedback shared by participants on sticky notes during the workshop.
These were events or types of events that community members wished to see a Fedora presence in 2024.

[[flagship]]

Flagship Fedora events are main events for all Fedora contributors.
These are typically run at a global scale and represent major congregations of people who work in and around the Fedora community.

* Fedora Flock
** A Flock in LATAM or APAC?
* Fedora Hatch
* Fedora Mentor Summit
* Fedora hackfests:
Great way to gather in-person with your team and work on new ideas.

:page-aliases: community:events:sop-ambassadors.adoc

This page documents best practices and standard operating procedures for Fedora Ambassadors on duty at Fedora-supported events.
It does not prescribe a hard requirement of what to do as an Ambassador, but it provides guidelines on how to align in-person interaction with the values of the Fedora community.

_Have your own suggestions to these best practices?_
_Propose your ideas link:https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home/-/issues[as a new issue] or by link:https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home/-/edit/main/docs/modules/events/pages/sop-ambassadors.adoc?ref_type=heads[opening a Merge Request]._


[[four-foundations]]

*TL;DNR*:
When in doubt, remember the Four F's.
Freedom, Friends, Features, First.

The Fedora community is a diverse community of people with a variety of backgrounds, nationalities, languages, and views.
We share common ground but we do not agree on everything as a project all the time.
However, all our actions as a community should be centered on a set of shared values that we agree upon.
Fedora has four key values that define who we are as a community, and we call those key values the _Four Foundations_.

Ambassadors are real, human faces behind our project.
For many people, a Fedora Ambassador at an event represents someone who is familiar with the project and knows how things work.
This means they can share their favorite successes of Fedora and/or their biggest challenges or frustrations with Fedora.
When an Ambassador responds to someone at an event, there is not a fixed script.
Often in conversation, one has to improvise.

When an Ambassador needs to do that real-time improvisation, this is when the Four Foundations are a helpful reminder of how to speak rightly as a representative of our diverse community.
Any response should fit within the bounds of our four key values as a community: _Freedom_, _Friends_, _Features_, _First._
You can read more about the meaning of each Foundation in xref:projects::index.adoc[Fedora's Mission and Foundations].


[[etiquette]]

As representatives of the Fedora community, an Ambassador has important responsibility in being that representative.
The actions of one Ambassador can have a far-reaching effect, for better and for worse.
These etiquette tips will help you start community interactions off on the right footing.

[[etiquette-team]]

Spend time to get to know your fellow Fedorans at the event with you.
Learn about their background and topics of knowledge.
This way, if a conference-goer asks a question that one Ambassador cannot answer, there is always someone else who could help answer a query or solve an issue that someone is having.
Knowing about what skills and knowledge your team is bringing to the table makes you an effective community connector.

[[etiquette-visitors]]

When running a booth or stand, make sure that visitors to the booth have first priority for conversations.
While it is natural to want to catch up with fellow Fedora contributors and Ambassadors, a shift at a booth is service to our community to interact with the Fedora community.
Catching up should happen outside of a booth shift or when there is a pause in booth traffic.
It is important to be respectful of visitors to the booth.
If a conversation behind the booth is not inclusive of unattended booth visitors, put it on pause until after interacting with the visitor.

:page-aliases: workflows:matrix-event-bot.adoc

Fedora transitioned its virtual events (e.g. Release Parties) to Pretix (for ticketing) and Matrix (for communication) in May 2024, starting with the Fedora Linux 40 Release Party.
The manual process used then was to periodically download CSV data from Pretix and sort through it in a spreadsheet to determine who had not been invited yet.
This happened while attendees continued to register leading up to and during the event.

To help make this work more efficient for future volunteers, a https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite[Matrix bot] was created to assist with automating this process.
This document aims to serve as a high-level overview of how to set up and make use of the bot for event organizers.


[[bot-setup]]

The bot is implemented as a plugin for the popular Matrix bot platform https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/index.html[Maubot], the same system that https://github.com/fedora-infra/matrix-bots/[other fedora Matrix bots] are made with.
The instructions for setting up the bot are largely the same regardless of where it runs and can be found in the https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite#basic-setup[README].

Ultimately, the goal is for this bot to be run on Fedora-managed infrastructure alongside the existing bots (such as meetbot and zodbot) so that the task of bot hosting and setup can be taken off the shoulders of event organizers.

If you would like to host an instance of the bot yourself, it is helpful to have the following things ready before starting:

- A Matrix account to use for the bot (one can be obtained from the current Fedora Community Architect to avoid using a personal one tied to a FAS login)
- The ability to access Pretix and manage the event that you plan to use the bot with
- (Optionally, for additional automation) a public facing web domain that you can point at the bot


[[communishift]]

If you are planning to use xref:infra::pages/communishift.adoc[Communishift] to host the bot for multiple fedora events, be aware that some https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite/milestone/1[additional work] may still needed to fully support multiple events, as well as GDPR considerations.

[[gdpr]]

When hosting on Communishift, you should also be aware of Communishift's policy on Personal Information.
This section is based on https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/11970[this] communishift provisioning ticket.

[NOTE]
====
This bot does require processing, and potentially storing, a very limited set of personal information.
You may have some additional responsibilities as the organizer of the event (or operator of the bot) in the event that someone chooses to exercise their rights under the GDPR.
====

*What information does the bot process?*
The bot fetches the Pretix order identifier and the users Matrix ID from Pretix.

*What information does the bot store?*
The bot may store the Pretix order identifier in memory or on disk.
The bot does not directly store the users Matrix ID, however their Matrix ID may still appear in the bot's logs (there is an https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite/issues/8[open issue] to address this)

*Why is this information needed and how is it used?*
The Pretix order identifer is used for the purposes of allowing the bot to avoid repeat-processing of duplicate orders.
The user's Matrix ID is used in order to invite the user to the Matrix room.
https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-an-event[The directions in the README] mention that event organizers should add help text next to the Matrix ID prompt to both inform the user that this is how their Matrix ID wil be used, and also direct them to enter it in the correct format.


[[usage]]
The bot aims to be as simple as possible for event organizers to use and has a few basic commands.

Prior to the event, the bot needs to be given a few pieces of information:

. What Matrix rooms you want to use for the event
. How the bot should connect to Pretix

This information is provided via commands such as `!setroom` and `!authorize`.
The bot also has a few convenience commands for checking the status of various aspects of the bot, as well as a command to mass-invite users from Pretix.

For full documentation about the commands available, see the https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage-and-commands[Usage section of the README].

One notable drawback of the bot with regard to commands is that, in order to prevent event attendees from messing with the bot, the bot is set up to only respond to commands that are given by Matrix accounts specifically listed in the bot's configuration.
There is an https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pretix-invite/issues/9[open issue] to improve this.


Fedocal is the community calendar used by the Fedora community.
It houses the various events, meetings, and important dates for the wider community.

Fedocal has multiple calendars for different teams and purposes, for example:

* Calendar for Fedora Release Updates: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/Fedora%20release/
* CommOps Team Calendar: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/commops/
* Fedora Infra Calendar: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/infrastructure/

To see any calendar in Fedora, visit the Fedocal homepage at: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/


Anything to do with Fedora can be added to Fedocal!

* Ongoing working meetings or workshops
* Events where Fedora has a presence
* Hackathons or get togethers with regional / local teams

Fedocal is for all of the Fedora community and has many differnet meetings.


We also recommend community members use the Events calendar in Fedocal to announce events they're aware of or Fedora communtiy may have a presence at.
We have a dedicated calendar called **Events** available at: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/Events/

Contributing your event to Fedocal helps the community in many ways:

* Visibility: Other Fedora contributors and users can discover local or virtual OSS events in their areas.
* Collaboration: More local face to face with collaborators can help you get new ideas or learn more about Fedora, our upstreams and/or downstream communities.
* Promotion: Fedora Marketing or Community Ops can feature events more easily if they are in Fedocal.

We especially encourage FOSS events that:

* Are **Open Source / Free Software** in nature (easy rule of thumb is if an event aligns with our Four Foundations)
* Involve Fedora community presence (speaking, booth, workshop, participation)
* Are accessible (time zones, language, free or low registration)

If you're organizing, hosting, or simply aware of such events please consider adding them to the Events calendar in Fedocal.


To add an event:

1. Access Fedocal at: https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/
2. Log in on the top left hand corner and sign in using your Fedora Account System (FAS) credentials.
3. Select the calendar
4. Click the + in the bottom right of the page to Add Event
5. Fill in the event details:
* Title of the event
* Date and time (ensure time zone is correct)
* Location (if in person) or virtual link (if online)
* Additional description
* Optional: reminders, recurring-event settings if applicable
6. Review the information, then click Add.
7. After adding, verify your event appears on the calendar.

TIP: You can add a group or distribution list to the reminders.
Many teams copy their FAS group using the pattern `groupname@fedoraproject.org` to notify all members.


If you want to view Fedora events in your own calendar app (such as Thunderbird, Google Calendar, etc), you can use the iCal export as a subscribed calendar rather than downloading the calendar.

Example Steps in Thunderbird:

1. Get the iCal URL by replacing your calendar name in this URL String https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/ical/<calendar>/ Where CommOps calendar would be https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/ical/commops/
2. Follow the directions from Mozilla Thunderbird to enter a Network Calendar with the iCal URL available here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-new-calendars#w_icalendar-ics

TIP: You can get all calendars by subscribing to https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/ical however be aware this will contain a lot of events.
