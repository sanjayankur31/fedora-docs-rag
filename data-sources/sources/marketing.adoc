[[contribute]]

Here are some examples of what constitutes a contribution to the {team_name}:

* Managing talking points for one or more editions, or parts of Fedora (a Fedora Edition, a major feature, etc.).
* Writing a release announcement or contributing a large section to a release announcement.
** Fixing a comma splice is not really a significant contribution.
Managing a section on the Workstation Edition is.
* Working to create one or more flyers or information sheets for an edition, Fedora overall, etc.
* Substantial work helping clean up the Marketing docs.
* Creating materials for Fedora Ambassadors for an event, or talking points for an event or events.
* Any observable significant and useful contribution that moves Fedora Marketing forward during a release cycle.
* Mentor and bring in new contributors to marketing.

We grant membership to anyone who invests in teaching other people the ropes, even if that means their impact is not as visible on the finished product as if they did the work themselves.

A good recommendation for beginners is to familiarize yourself with the xref:resources.adoc[the tools we use] in order to help with a particular kind of work.

Overview of all known social media accounts for the Fedora Project.
2023-11-19

Social media connects Fedora developers, users, friends, and enthusiasts around the world.
This is also one strategy to share Fedora announcements, community news, and other updates.
All known accounts are documented below, curated by a best-effort volunteering community.


[[official]]

Maintained by Marketing and/or https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/fedora-socialmedia/[Social Media] Teams.
Anyone with access to Official Accounts should be members of the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/fedora-socialmedia/[fedora-socialmedia] FAS group.
If you believe you should be in the group, contact a https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/fedora-socialmedia/[group sponsor].

[[community]]

Fedora Community-Managed Accounts are related to the Fedora Project, but not officially maintained by the Fedora Marketing Team or Social Media administrators.
Often, these accounts are specific to a region or country.
These pages are typically run by an individual contributor or a group of contributors.
However, these accounts are *not* officially endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat Inc.
They are listed here to promote easier discoverability of places where Fedora contributors and users gather online.

[[security]]

Most official social media accounts are managed by each administrator's personal account on that network, like for Facebook or Google+.
In cases like LinkedIn, access is granted to individual accounts.
However, single passwords still exist for most of these accounts.
The passwords are securely stored within Fedora's infrastructure, along with private assets used by the link:Infrastructure[Infrastructure team].
As of October 2016, User:Puiterwijk[Patrick Uiterwijk] manages password storage and security.

Learn more about the Fedora Marketing Team social media model and discover how you can contribute.

The Fedora Marketing Team operates a three-tiered model for social media contributions:

. xref:#social-media-manager[*Social Media Manager*]
. xref:#content-contributor[*Content Contributor*]
. xref:#community-contributor[*Community Contributor*]

Each role focuses on different types of contributions, such as posting content, introducing new ideas for our social media, and sharing updates about other parts of the Fedora Project to keep our users informed.
Members of each role have different access levels to our social media accounts.
For instance, Social Media Managers have higher level access to our social media account than those in the other roles.
Read on for details of each role, types of contributions made within them and how you can get involved.


[[social-media-manager]]

Social Media Managers are granted direct access to our social media accounts and are categorized into two specific functions: xref:#account-lead[*Account Lead*] and xref:#account-contributor[*Account Contributor*].
These functions have varying levels of contribution and responsibility.

[[account-lead]]

An Account Lead acts as a bridge, independently cross-posting content from one Fedora account to another.
This involves following Fedora on other platforms, staying up-to-date on their activities, and copying content to your assigned account.
You do not need to source or create new content to share; your focus is on sharing existing content.

The Account Lead role has a more advanced and involved version known as the Curator.
Curators take full ownership of a social media account, independently sourcing content, crafting posts, and actively engaging with the Fedora and Linux communities.
This demands a higher level of responsibility, proactive engagement, and a deep understanding of Fedora, its "products," stakeholders, and community dynamics.

[[account-contributor]]

As an Account Contributor, your main responsibility is to post social media content provided by others.
For instance, you will get a ping by someone with what to post.
You do not need to come up with content on your own, but focus on executing the posting requests from others.
A key aspect of this role is being readily available to receive content submissions from others.

[[ways]]

* Social media management
* Engaging with our users on social media
* Posting content on our social media accounts
* Checking and responding to comments, tags, and direct messages
* Working with individuals in the other roles to schedule and post content

There are four rings of different sizes stacked on top of each other, forming four levels of a pyramid. The pyramid is labeled where the bottom level is the most inclusive and the top level is the most exclusive. The bottom and widest ring is titled, "Community Contributor". The next ring stacked upward is less wider and titled, "Content Contributor". The next ring stacked upward is also less wider and titled, "Account Contributor". The top ring is the most narrow ring and titled, "Account Lead / Curator". The top two rings on the stack are also labeled as "Social Media Managers".]


[[content-contributor]]

Content Contributors actively contribute content ideas for social media posts.
They assist with issues on GitLab that the marketing team needs help with.
They do not have direct access to our social media accounts but collaborate with social media managers to share content.
They help in managing social media campaigns, promoting Fedora’s initiatives and events.
These contributors curate content for use by the Social Media Managers.

[[ways-to]]

* Come up with interesting ideas to post about.
Write a post on that topic, then follow the submission process below.
Make sure the content is engaging and aligns with Fedora’s messaging and voice.
* Work with the xref:need-help.adoc[Marketing Team] to coordinate and manage social media campaigns.
* Curate content for use by the Lead.

Follow the steps below to submit your content idea to our Social Media Managers.

[[sumbit-post]]

* Open an issue on GitLab for your idea/content in the Fedora https://gitlab.com/fedora/marketing/marketing-planning/-/issues[Marketing Planning] repo.
* Choose ***social-media-template*** and follow the prompt to submit your idea.
* A Social Media Manager will review your submission, provide feedback, and approve it for posting.


[[community-contributor]]

Community Contributors are people whose primary role at Fedora is not marketing, communications, or promotion.
They come to the Marketing Team for assistance on promoting their content on social media, such as: social media coverage for specific events, articles, or announcements.

[[ways-to-contribute]]

* Reach out to the Marketing Team with topics, ideas, or requests for social media coverage.
The easiest way is to join our https://matrix.to/#/#marketing:fedoraproject.org[Matrix room] and simply mention what assistance you need.
Usually we can accommodate these requests without having to create a ticket on GitLab.
However, for larger or more complex request, you can create a ticket on GitLab.
But before then, the team prefers that you ask for help first, and if the request is large, the team will create a ticket if necessary.
* Inform the marketing team about upcoming events where Fedora will have a presence, requesting promotional coverage.

[NOTE]
====
This article is draft content and is not yet finalized.
This notice will be removed once the Fedora Ready program is officially launched.
====

The Fedora Ready program supports vendors who meet our criteria in their support of Fedora Linux on their devices.
Also, we want to simplify the process for our users to find and purchase these supported devices.
Our xref:ready/list.adoc[central hub] lists all Fedora Ready devices so people can easily locate where to buy them.


[[fedora-ready-is-not]]

* Fedora Ready is NOT a certification or endorsement program.
* Fedora Ready is not a formal partnership program nor are we in legal partnership with vendors listed on our compatibility list.
Vendors oversee the lifecycle of their devices and offer what makes a good experience for their customers.


[[criteria]]

Vendors are listed under Fedora Ready if:

* A vendor is selling a computer with Fedora Linux available pre-installed:
** We have reputable contact with decision-makers or points of contact within your team.
** The computer is available for purchase online.
** If the product is in the pipeline and not ready yet, then we should be in contact in the lead up to the product's launch to tie our promotional efforts to that moment.

* A vendor is officially supporting Fedora Linux as an operating system for their computer:
** We have reputable contact with decision-makers or points of contact within your team.
** You need to publicly share which devices have the support for Fedora Linux online.
** If the support is something that is planned, then we should be in contact with your team to tie promotion to the product's announcement.

* A vendor offers official Fedora Linux support without preinstallation.

* They agree to ship a Fedora Linux Edition (such as https://fedoraproject.org/kde/[Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop] or https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/[Fedora Workstation]) unmodified when using the Fedora trademark and are in compliance with all Fedora trademark guidelines.

[NOTE]
====
The criteria outlined here are subject to change as the program evolves.
We expect to iterate and refine these criteria based on how vendors support Fedora Linux and as the program develops over time.
====


[[delisting]]

Fedora Ready vendors are hardware companies that meet our criteria in their support of Fedora Linux on their hardware.
To keep our program running smoothly, we occasionally re-evaluate vendor offerings for compliance.
If a vendor's support of Fedora Linux on their device no longer align with our criteria, we may need to remove them from the list.
This helps us maintain the program's value.

[[delisting-criteria]]

* A vendor decides to stop supporting Fedora Linux on their devices after confirmation.
* A vendor ships a modified Fedora  Linux when using the Fedora trademark or in a manner that differs from what we offer directly to our users.
* A vendor is non-compliance with all Fedora trademark guidelines.
* A vendor's actions conflict with our values or become detrimental to the program's integrity.
In such cases, we reserve the right to take necessary actions, including removing the vendor and /or product from the program, to protect the integrity of the program and our trademark.

[[delisting-process]]

*Initial Communication*:
If a vendor does not meet our criteria, we will notify the vendor about the possibility of being delisted.
We will specify the issues observed and the criteria they have failed to meet.

*Vendor Response Period*:
The vendor will have a specified period (e.g., 30 days) to respond to the notification and implement the necessary corrective actions to comply with Fedora Ready standards.

*Evaluation of Response*:
After the response period, we will re-evaluate the vendor’s status.
If the vendor has addressed the issues satisfactorily, we will continue their listing with a probationary review scheduled.
If the vendor has failed to comply or the response is unsatisfactory, we will proceed to the next step.

*Final Decision and Notification*:
We will make a final decision on delisting the vendor.
If delisting is decided, we will notify the vendor of the decision and the reasons for it.

*Update Listing*:
We will update the xref:ready/list.adoc[Fedora Ready compatibility list] accordingly.


[[limitations]]

Our program is run by a dedicated team of volunteers, who are not full-time employees.
This means that we do not have full-time availability or dedicated company resources, but our commitment to supporting vendors remains unwavering.

[[vendors]]

- *Availability:*
Our team members volunteer their time alongside their personal and professional commitments.
Because of this, our response times may be a bit longer than what you might expect from a full-time corporate team.

- *Resources:*
We do not have specific resources allocated exclusively for this program.
However, we are here to provide feedback and guidance in various forms.
Ultimately, it is up to the vendors to implement and support Fedora Linux on their devices.

[[past]]

Despite these constraints, we have successfully provided support to vendors in various ways.
Here are a few examples of what we have helped vendors with in the past:

* Two product launches for Slimbook which has included social media campaigns, distribution to media outlets, co-writing of the product's announcement, and an episode on the https://fedoraproject.fireside.fm/31[Fedora Podcast]
* Direct and confidential contact with the Fedora Quality Team for quick help with issues as they have arisen (not promised, case by case)
* The Fedora Ready xref:ready/list.adoc[compatibility list]
* Regular social media posts and boosts between accounts to support each other among our respective communities


[[support]]

Fedora Ready support vendors by offering:

* Marketing support through Fedora's channels.
* Technical support for integrating Fedora Linux with their hardware.
* Liaison support to foster community connections.
* Curating feedback from users.


[[devices]]

* *Fedora preinstalled:*
Computers that come with Fedora Linux officially preinstalled by the vendor.
* *Fedora supported by vendor:*
Computers tested and verified to run Fedora Linux successfully.
* *Fedora may run:*
Computers that may run Fedora Linux successfully based on informal assurances from the vendor.

For example, some Lenovo devices have not been tested for Fedora Linux, but they were tested for Ubuntu.
The Lenovo Linux team has informally said that Fedora Linux has a decent chance of running on those devices.


[[list]]

You can find Vendors and Fedora Ready approved devices on our xref:ready/list.adoc#fedora-ready-approved-devices[compatibility list].


[[contact]]

Vendors interested joining the Fedora Ready program can email us at fedora-ready-team [at] fedoraproject [dot] org.
Then, we will discuss how to get you onboard.

*Official Fedora Ready Brand Elements Usage and Guidelines*

This document outlines the proper use of the Fedora xref::ready/index.adoc[Fedora Ready] identity elements.
It is important to note that the Fedora Ready brand guidelines are secondary to the xref:legal::trademarks.adoc[Fedora Trademark Guidelines].
Therefore, the Fedora Trademark Guidelines take precedence over everything outlined in this document.


[[fedora-ready]]

Fedora Ready is a promotional program by the Fedora Project to support hardware vendors who preload Fedora Linux in their hardware or have tested their hardware to be compatible with Fedora Linux.
The program aims to also simplify the process for our users to identify and purchase Fedora Ready approved devices.


[[guideline-usage]]

Use this guideline if you are working with our brand elements and want to be sure that you are following the guidelines.
If you want to do something different with the logo, please email fedora-ready-team [AT] fedoraproject [DOT] org and we will be happy to help you.


[[messaging]]

Fedora Ready messaging is clear, friendly, and straightforward.
As a means to promote Fedora Ready vendors and devices, we utilize various Fedora social channels.
Our messaging or content is part of our brand asset, and it must remain unaltered.
If you must use our marketing content you must provide us the credit.
Vendors do not need to imitate our messaging style since they are free to create their own marketing messages tailored to their business.


[[logo]]

The Fedora Ready logo represents the Fedora Ready program and all that it does.
We aim for a simple and modern design that makes our brand stand out and is easily identifiable.

[NOTE]
====
*Do not use the Fedora Ready logos on this page without written permission*.
The images on this page are Fedora trademarks and are not licensed for reuse.
Please obtain permission for using the Fedora trademark and follow all applicable guidelines set out on this page and in the xref:legal/trademarks.adoc[official trademark guidelines].

Official Fedora Ready compatibility list with hardware and vendors that work well with Fedora Linux out-of-the-box.
// Article content last reviewed and verified by a human on…

Lenovo tests, certifies and supports Linux on several platforms, including the entire ThinkPad, ThinkStation, and ThinkCenter portfolios.
These platforms provide globally available Linux preloaded systems that are supported by Lenovo.

The goal of the program is to reduce complexity and offer a wider range of platforms in order to provide Linux users with a better user experience and confidence that their system will run well with Linux.
Support for these platforms is upstream, with firmware updates available through LVFS.
Lenovo aims to contribute directly to the community upstream projects and to continue improving the Linux experience.

All Fedora preinstalled models have been through extensive testing with the Lenovo QA team and appropriate regulatory checks.
All Fedora supported models have had Ubuntu certification enablement and Lenovo QA testing. We expect Fedora to run well on them as support is upstream. FW updates are available on LVFS

Lenovo is proud to work closely with the Fedora community to provide open source friendly solutions.
Details on Lenovo Linux platforms are available on www.lenovo.com/linux.

New (for 2025): Linux discoverability on the US and Canada site is finally working:

https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/results/?visibleDatas=699%3ALinux[USA]

https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/results/?visibleDatas=1068%3ALinux[Canada]

Hoping this comes to other geo's soon. In Europe and India look for the "Build Your PC" option on certified laptops and it should have Fedora available if the platform has a Fedora preload.

This guide outlines a streamlined procedure for processing Fedora livestreams (e.g., Flock, release parties, Fedora Week of Diversity), making it easier to edit and share recordings of these events.
This standardized workflow utilizes tools and automation to minimize manual effort and ensure consistency.

.Tools You'll Need
* https://www.mifi.no/losslesscut/[LosslessCut] (version 3.62.0 or later recommended)
* https://sponsor.ajay.app/[Sponsorblock] (optional, but highly recommended)
* https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape] with the https://gitlab.com/Moini/nextgenerator[Next Generator extension] (for creating thumbnails)
* Python scripts (provided in the guide)

[NOTE]
====
This workflow assumes you have basic familiarity with command-line tools and video editing concepts.
====

[[preparing-metadata]]

This process relies on a CSV file (comma-separated values) containing information about each talk (title, speakers, identifier).
This data is used for automation and consistency.

[[automatic-metadata]]

If your event uses Pretalx, you can automatically generate the CSV file using a Python script:

. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://gitlab.com/fedora/commops/home.git`
. Navigate to the script:
`cd commops/scripts/conference`
. Run the script:
`python main.py <Pretalx Schedule URL>`

[NOTE]
====
Ensure the Pretalx schedule accurately reflects the livestream order.
====

The script can also generate YouTube descriptions based on a template file (`description.template.txt`).

[[manual-metadata]]

If you're not using Pretalx, create a CSV file with these columns:

* `Title`:
The title of the talk.
* `Speakers`:
The speaker(s) of the talk.
* `Identifier`:
A unique identifier for the talk (lowercase, no spaces or special characters).

Populate the CSV with information for each talk.


[[tagging-segments]]

Use Sponsorblock to tag intermissions and chapters in the YouTube video.
This helps automate splitting the video later.

. Install the Sponsorblock extension for your browser.
. Open the YouTube video.
. Use the Sponsorblock controls to tag intermissions (usually "Intermission/Intro Animation") and optionally tag individual talks as "Chapter."
. Submit your tags to the Sponsorblock database.


[[generating-timestamps]]

YouTube uses a specific format for chapters.
You can automate this formatting using a Python script:

. Navigate to the script:
`cd commops/scripts/timestamps`
. Run the script:
`python main.py <YouTube video URL> [<stream CSV file>]`

The script will generate the timestamps.
If you provide the stream CSV, it will also fill in the talk titles.

Alternatively, you can manually edit the timestamps from Sponsorblock to match the YouTube format.


[[splitting-video]]

Use `yt-dlp` to download the video:

----
yt-dlp <YouTube video URL>
----

Then, use LosslessCut to split the video based on the Sponsorblock tags:

. Open LosslessCut and drag the downloaded video into it.
. Import the `losslesscut.csv` file (if generated) to load the segments.
. Verify the segments align with the talks.
. Click the export button and configure the settings:
* Output folder
* Output file names: `++${SEG_LABEL}${EXT}++`
* Enable "Smart cut (experimental)"
. Click _Export_ to split the video.


[[creating-thumbnails]]

Use Inkscape with the Next Generator extension to create thumbnails for each talk:

. Design your thumbnail template in Inkscape, using variables like `%VAR_TalkName%` and `%VAR_PresenterNames%` to represent data from your CSV.
. Go to *Extensions > Export > NextGenerator*.
. Configure the export settings:
* CSV file path
* File format
* File name pattern (e.g., `%VAR_Identifier%`)
. Click _Export_ to generate the thumbnails.


[[adding-intros]]

You can add a short intro with the thumbnail at the beginning of each talk using a Python script:

. Navigate to the script:
`cd commops/scripts/transcode`
. Prepare a CSV file with talk data (if not already generated).
. Configure the `config.ini` file with settings for intro duration, etc.
. Run the script according to the instructions in the README.


[[further-automation]]

While this workflow incorporates significant automation, some areas can be further improved:

* *Chapter Creation*:
Streamline the process of creating YouTube chapters.
* *Recombining Clips*:
Automate the handling of interruptions and inconsistencies in the livestream.
* *Video Reformatting*:
Automatically convert videos to optimal formats for processing.
* *Captions*:
Explore automated captioning and translation solutions.
* *Audio Processing*:
Implement loudness normalization and dynamic range compression.
* *End Cards*:
Automate the addition of end cards to videos.

These improvements would further enhance the efficiency and robustness of the livestream processing pipeline.
