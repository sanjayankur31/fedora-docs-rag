== What is Fedora?

[.lead]
The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a
free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share
user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we
make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff
with it.


\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;


== What is Fedora all about?

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different
views and approaches, but together we share some common values.
We call these the “\&#42;Four Foundations\&#42;”: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.

== Our Vision
____
_The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities._
____

As a project, we want everyone to live in a universe of free and open source software; the user should be in control of their computing.
But it’s not enough that the software is there, waiting to be used.
It has to be accessible and usable.
This vision also reflects our community approach — the Friends foundation.
Fedora isn’t bits and bytes.
Fedora is our people, and we want the statement to include our vision of a healthy community.

== Our Mission

____
_Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
containers that enables software developers and community members to
build tailored solutions for their users._
____

At the operating system level, we don’t just integrate. We do new things
— we build a _platform_, not just a distribution. The _Features_ and
_First_ foundations drive us to innovate. We do all of this as a
transparent, collaborative community of _Friends_, and entirely as open
source and free software — _Freedom_.


== Our Method

The Fedora Project is a center for innovation in free and open source
software. In our community, contributors of all kinds come together to
advance the ecosystem for the benefit of everyone. The Fedora community
contributes everything it builds back to the free and open source world
and continues to make advances of significance to the broader community,
as evidenced by the regular and rapid incorporation of its features into
other Linux distributions. Regardless of which Linux distribution you
use, you are relying on code developed within the Fedora Project.

We believe software patents
are harmful, a hindrance to innovation in software development, and are
inconsistent with the values of free and open source software. While tightly
integrating proprietary and patent encumbered components might superficially
improve ease of use, this practice does not benefit the community in the
long run. The Fedora community prefers approaches that benefit the progress
of free software in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of
use.


== Our Community

Fedora is more than just software. It is a community of contributors
from https://fedoracommunity.org/[around the world], including volunteers
and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance the interests
of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join. No matter
what your skills are, we have a place for you in our community! We are
xref:package-maintainers::index.adoc[software engineers],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design[designers and artists],
xref:infra::index.adoc[system administrators],
xref:websites::index.adoc[web designers],
xref:fedora-docs::index.adoc[writers],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors[speakers],
xref:localization::index.adoc[translators], and more — and we are happy to help you get
started.

We believe that all contributors should
https://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct[be excellent to each other].
By creating an environment for constructive contribution, we can more
effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size,
diversity, and strength of our community.


== Leadership and Governance

The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is responsible for
stewardship of the Fedora Project as a whole and supports the health and
growth of the Fedora Community. As in any large project, there are many
different levels of responsibility, accountability, and decision-making. As
a general rule, we want people working on a Fedora
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Subprojects[subproject] to make meaningful decisions about their
areas of interest and expertise. More details are available on our page on
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Leadership[Fedora Leadership].


= Upstream First: A Core Fedora Principle

The concept of 'upstream first' is a fundamental principle within the Fedora Project.
It shapes our history, culture, and approach to contributing to the open source ecosystem.
Understanding this principle is crucial for anyone looking to contribute to Fedora and the broader Linux distribution ecosystem.


[[upstream-why]]
== Fedora's Commitment to Upstream First

Fedora, as a Linux distribution, plays a unique role as an _integrator_ of countless software components.
While Fedora develops some of its own software, its primary function is to package and deliver a cohesive operating system experience built upon the work of numerous upstream projects.

From its inception, Fedora has championed the principle of _upstream first_.
This isn't a policy or hard rule; it's a core value woven into the fabric of the Fedora community.
Fedora contributors believe that changes and improvements to open source software should, whenever possible, be shared back with the upstream projects.
This ensures that \&#42;all\&#42; users of that software, not just Fedora users, can benefit.
Ultimately, Fedora's final objective is the benefit of the user, and Fedora contributors will do what they think is best for the user, even if upstream disagrees.

Upstream first is also a pragmatic engineering principle.
By contributing changes upstream, Fedora reduces the long-term maintenance burden of carrying downstream-specific patches.
Maintaining external patch sets can become increasingly difficult as upstream projects evolve.
Embracing upstream first helps ensure the sustainability of Fedora and its contributions.

This approach has a ripple effect throughout the open source ecosystem.
Changes landed in Fedora often impact numerous downstream projects that use Fedora as a foundation.
Therefore, contributing to Fedora is a highly effective way to influence and improve the broader open source landscape, particularly within the RPM/Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

By prioritizing upstream contributions, Fedora aligns with its vision of a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive and welcoming communities.
This commitment extends to \&#42;all\&#42; open source software, not just Fedora itself.


[[upstream-downstream]]
== Understanding Upstream and Downstream

In the world of open source, projects often have interconnected relationships described as 'upstream' and 'downstream.'
The _upstream_ project is the original source of the software—the foundation upon which other projects are built.
_Downstream_ projects, in turn, are those that utilize and often modify the upstream software.
Think of it like a river: the upstream is the source, and downstream projects are further along the flow, receiving and potentially altering the water.

This metaphor is essential for understanding how open source projects depend on and interact with each other.
Different development models encourage varying types of upstream/downstream relationships.

[[upstream-communication]]
=== Open Communication with Upstream

Fedora recognizes the importance of clear and open communication with upstream projects.
We believe in fostering strong relationships with upstream developers and communities, and actively seek their input and feedback.

Fedora is always open to hearing from upstream projects about how we can improve our collaboration and integration processes.
We understand that Fedora's downstream usage can sometimes create challenges or friction for upstream projects.
We encourage upstream maintainers to reach out to us if they encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement.

Our goal is to work together constructively to find solutions that benefit both Fedora and the upstream projects we rely on.
While we cannot always accommodate every upstream request, we are committed to listening, learning, and adapting our practices to minimize any negative impact on upstream communities.

The philosophy of working upstream first doesn't end with just development.
It also encompasses a productive, positive, and respectful relationship with our upstream projects.
Our communities overlap and we want to extend our Fedora values to their project as much as we would within Fedora.
To that end we always want to deal with challenges between projects together and have clear lines of communication.

[[upstream-exceptions]]
=== When Downstream Changes Happen

While Fedora prioritizes upstream contributions, there are situations where downstream-specific changes are necessary.
These exceptions are not contradictions of the upstream-first principle, but rather acknowledgements of the complex realities of software development and distribution.

Reasons for downstream patches include:

\&#42; \&#42;Upstream Rejection\&#42;:
Sometimes, upstream maintainers may reject a patch for various reasons, even if it's beneficial to Fedora.
Fedora may still need to carry that patch to address a specific issue or requirement.
\&#42; \&#42;Upstream Progress\&#42;:
Upstream projects may move forward with new features or changes that require significant adaptation in Fedora.
Fedora may need to backport fixes or implement temporary workarounds while the downstream adaptation is completed.
\&#42; \&#42;Distribution-Specific Needs\&#42;:
Fedora, and its downstream distributions like EPEL, may have unique requirements or constraints that necessitate downstream modifications.
These needs might relate to specific hardware support, security considerations, or integration with other Fedora components.
\&#42; \&#42;Non-Free Blobs\&#42;:
Fedora is committed to promoting free and open source software and building everything from source.
Sometimes, upstream projects include non-free or pre-built binary blobs that Fedora needs to patch out to adhere to its principles.
While Fedora may discuss potential fixes with upstream, these patches might not always be accepted if there are no suitable alternatives or if they remove functionality.

In these situations, Fedora strives to minimize the scope and duration of downstream patches, and continues to work towards upstreaming changes whenever feasible.
Understanding the reasons for downstream changes is essential for maintaining transparency and trust within the community.


[[examples]]
== Examples in Action

The principle of 'upstream first' manifests in various ways.
Here are a couple of examples:

\&#42; \&#42;Packaging Improvements\&#42;:
A Fedora packager identifies a bug or missing feature in a build toolchain.
Instead of creating a Fedora-specific patch, they submit a patch upstream to the toolchain's maintainers.
After review and discussion, the patch is merged upstream, benefiting all users of the toolchain and eliminating the need for a downstream Fedora patch.
\&#42; \&#42;Community Script\&#42;:
A Fedora contributor develops a script for analyzing package data.
They share the script publicly.
Another contributor enhances the script with new features and submits a pull request.
The original contributor merges the changes, making the improved script available to the entire community.
\&#42; \&#42;License Clarifications\&#42;:
A Fedora packager discovers licensing issues with an open source project, such as unclear or non-compliant licenses for included assets.
Instead of simply excluding the project from Fedora, they work with the upstream developers to clarify or correct the licenses.
This ensures that the project can be included in Fedora and benefits the broader open source community by promoting license compliance.
\&#42; \&#42;Avoiding Bundled Dependencies\&#42;:
A Fedora packager notices that an upstream project bundles a specific version of a dependency.
Instead of using the bundled dependency, they repackage the project to use the system-wide version of the dependency.
This ensures consistency across Fedora packages, enables rapid security patch deployment, and maintains compatibility between interdependent packages.
\&#42; \&#42;Early Testing and Bug Reporting\&#42;:
Fedora often pioneers the integration of new software versions and libraries.
This early adoption allows Fedora contributors to identify and report build or compatibility bugs upstream, particularly in the Python ecosystem.
These contributions benefit the entire open source community by ensuring smoother transitions and upgrades for everyone.

These examples illustrate how upstream first fosters collaboration, shared ownership, and continuous improvement within the open source ecosystem.
We encourage you to think about how you can apply the 'Upstream First' principle in your Fedora contributions.
Have a story about an upstream contribution?
Share it with the community!


= Fedora Leadership

The Fedora Project is led by contributors from across the community.
Different functional areas of Fedora at times evolve, build, or dismantle their own formal (or informal!) leadership over time.
Because Fedora is an open source project, we encourage new contributors to identify problems, find solutions, and collaborate with other members to achieve results.
Our community recognizes and empowers able leaders from among our peers.

The Fedora Project aims to have a thin layer of governance that enables decision making without excessive drag.


The following are current examples of _leadership groups_ in Fedora.

== Fedora Council ==
image::council-badge.png[float='right',50%]

The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is the topmost governance and leadership body in Fedora, and is made up of appointed and elected members from across the Fedora community.
Details about the Council such as size, constitution, and succession planning are found in the xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council Charter].

The https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fpl/[Fedora Project Leader] (or 'FPL') serves as the chair of the Council.


== Fedora Engineering Steering Committee ==

The xref:fesco::index.adoc[Fedora Engineering Steering Committee] (commonly known as 'FESCo') is a community-elected body empowered by the Council to manage the technical features of the Fedora distribution and specific implementations of policy in the Fedora Project.
You can find further information about FESCo, its members, and its policies on the xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo section].


== Fedora Mindshare Committee ==

The xref:mindshare-committee::index.adoc[Mindshare Committee] represents leadership for user and contributor community growth and support.


== Other groups ==

The list above is not a complete list of every group of empowered community members.
Other groups steer specific parts of Fedora as well, empowered and supported by the relevant teams.
The list above shows the three leadership groups that most often work on issues of policy or practice affecting large portions of the Fedora Project.

Community members are always encouraged to get involved in leading Fedora in ways that are important to them, while minimizing overhead and governance project-wide.


=== Working Groups ===

Fedora https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Editions[Editions] — currently,
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Atomic_WG[Atomic],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Server[Server],
and
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation[Workstation],
— and sometimes Fedora Project Objectives are lead by _Working Groups_.
These groups are either independent subcommittees of FESCo, Mindshare, or the Council.
They have formal membership and decision-making processes, but generally the membership is intended to include active contributors and the decision-making power reflects that.
A seat on the Working Group itself is _not at all_ required to participate meaningfully in the work on Editions or Objectives.


=== Subprojects ===

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/subprojects.html[Subprojects] are long-standing major areas of effort under the overall Fedora umbrella.
Each subproject has its own governance.


=== Special Interest Groups ===

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/sigs.html[Special Interest Groups], or 'SIGs', are much less formal.
The process for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Creating_a_Fedora_SIG[creating a SIG] has \&#42;no red tape\&#42;.
Different SIGs have different structures; some use formalized voting and others don't.
Some SIGs may eventually become subprojects; for others, the lightweight framework is perfect.


= How is Fedora Organized?

image::orgchart.png[Fedora Organizational Chart,100%]

Fedora is a big project, with many moving parts and dozens of groups and subgroups.
This chart gives a general overview and a sense of how things fit together.
The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is our overall leadership and governance body.
Most of the project is then roughly organized under https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/[FESCo]
(the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee) or the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/[Mindshare Committee].

xref:engineering::index.adoc[Engineering teams] includes a list of technical teams and
initiatives, most of which operate under FESCo.

Since many groups are rather informal, don't take the chart as written in stone. Also, if
it is a little overwhelming, don't worry. Fedora is a friendly project — just pick an area
you're interested in, introduce yourself to the people involved, and get started. Or, if
you don't know where to start, see xref:join.adoc[how to get involved].

== The Fedora Logo

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs, including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth tablecloths and banners, and other printed material.

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement of free and open source software and content.

== The Dos and Donts of the Fedora Logo

Don't search for the logos on a search engine and use whatever you find there. There are many unofficial variations on the Fedora logos that are not authorized, are unofficial, and do not respect these guidelines. Please do not use them or spread them further!

Here are some guidelines you should avoid if you would like to use some of our logos:

[grid=none,_frame=none]
|=======================
|image:/do-not-adjust.png[alt='Do not adjust any of the logos'] Do not adjust any of the logos | image:/do-not-colour.png[alt='Do not switch the colors'] Do not switch the colors
|image:/do-not-background.png[alt='Do not use the logo on a similarly-colored backgrounds'] Do not use the logo on a similarly-colored backgrounds | image:/do-not-rearrange.png[alt='Do not rearrange elements of the logo'] Do not rearrange elements of the logo
|image:/do-not-stray.png[alt='Do not stray from the color palette'] Do not stray from the color palette | image:/do-not-distort.png[alt='Do not stretch or distort the logo'] Do not stretch or distort the logo

|=======================

== Colors

We keep a single color palette to keep our artwork consistent, whether it is different Fedora materials, Fedora materials on screen, on the web, or on printed materials. Past mistakes have included Fedora DVDs coming out purple (true story!) so please pay attention to these colors, and please always use CMYK colors for professionally-printed collateral and objects such as printed banners, T-shirts, hats, and stickers. Otherwise, your design may well come out purple instead of blue!

=== The Main Palette

=== Color-blind safe palette

image::/colour-blind-safe-palette.png[alt='Color-blind safe palette']

== Typography

We recommend the following complementary fonts to use along with the logos. Both recommended fonts are openly licensed and freely distributable.

We recommend using Open Sans as a body text / copy font. It comes in a wide range of weights.

We recommend using Montserrat as a titling / headline font. Montserrat is also used in the Fedora Editions logos.

image::/fonts.png[alt='Selection of fonts that can be used']

== Characters

Most of these characters were created as part of the Fedora Characters Revamp Project. These mascots can be used in different projects.

You will be introduced to Badger, Beefy, Panda and Colúr and their history within the Fedora Community along with what part they belong to as well.

=== Panda


Panda is a happy go-lucky panda with glowing ears and a glowing nuclear symbol on her stomach and was originally created as a helper. You were able to find her on on the 404 and 500 pages and also was in the Fedora Docs pointing out tips and tricks. Panda is female and is a general mascot for the Fedora community. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake redesigned the Panda during the Fedora Character Revamp Project.

=== Badger

Badger is the Fedora Badges mascot and has been featured on a lot of different badges throughout the years. Badger was fist inspired by a popular early 2000's internet meme involving badgers and snakes. Badger is non-binary. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake brought them to life by creating a new style for  the Badger to fit in to the Fedora style.

=== Beefy


Beefy is a general mascot for the Fedora Community. He was the release name for Fedora 17 and has been a popular character even before Fedora Linux! He became a meme between Linux users. Beefy is male and on his belly, the mustard indicates progress. He was also a bootup screen for Fedora in past years and as it was loading, the mustard on his belly grew. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake revamped the style of Beefy and created him in many poses.  If you would like to know more about the origins of the Beefy Miracle, please visit:

=== Colúr

Colúr is our newest character that was created as a mascot for our Flock events. In 2022, Jess Chitas created him to go along with the Flock events and to also bring a new Fedora character to the table! He is based on the Pink-Necked Green Pigeon and his name came from the Irish meaning Pigeon but also sounds like the word 'Color'.

= What are Community Initiatives?
:page-aliases: objectives.adoc

Want to do something big?
Have an idea that won’t fit in a single release cycle?
Perhaps an improvement broader than the technical scope covered by the Changes policy?
Want to make sure the community is aligned behind your goal, and that you have the resources and access you need to make it happen?
\&#42;A Community Initiative may be the framework for you!\&#42;

Fedora Community Initiatives (formerly 'Objectives') are projects which do not fall neatly into the biannual Fedora Linux release cycle.
Typically they require longer to complete (e.g. 8-18 months) and are not limited to engineering projects.
Other key areas are administration; documentations; outreach; motivation; communications; budgets and best practice.
Within the Project these are grouped under a heading of xref:mindshare-committee::index.adoc[Mindshare].
The Council looks to achieve a balance between engineering projects and those aligned with Mindshare.

The primary role of the xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is to identify the short-, medium-, and long-term goals of the Fedora community and to organize and enable the project to best achieve them.
Anyone can propose a Community Initiative to the Council.
To be accepted, it should align with Fedora’s xref:project::index.adoc\&#35;_our_mission[mission statement] and long-term goals.

Each Community Initiative has a designated Community Initiative Lead.
This Lead sits on the Council for the duration of the Initiative and is responsible for coordinating efforts to reach the Community Initiative’s goals, as well as evaluating and reporting on progress.
The Initiative Lead works regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that progress is made.


[[proposing]]
== Proposing a Community Initiative

To propose a Community Initiative to the Council, the Lead should first discuss on the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/council[\&#35;council tag on Fedora Discussion].
Next, if well-received, file a https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/[ticket].
Of course, people need to be ready to do the actual work required — a Community Initiative without passionate bottom-liners will not get far.

To succeed, Community Initiatives require a leadership team with division of responsibility.
For example separating roles of project leadership, engineering, marketing and documentation, depending on the size and scope of the Initiative.
The Council can assist a proposer in finding the right people to work on the project if required.

[[proposing-sponsors]]
=== Executive Sponsors

Every Community Initiative must have an Executive Sponsor.
This can be any current member of the Council – even, possibly, the Lead of another Initiative.
You should find a sponsor as part of community discussion before filing a ticket.
Once someone has agreed to the responsibility, the proposal can move forward.

[[proposing-sponsors-role]]
==== Role of the Executive Sponsor

A Fedora Council member becomes an Executive Sponsor until completion of the Community Initiative or for the duration of their Council term (whichever comes first).
The Executive Sponsor is responsible for partnering with the Lead as a connection point to the Fedora Project at a high-level.
The Executive Sponsor represents a wider view of what the Fedora Project is focused on, whether that is in terms of the Fedora strategy or a specific area of interest (e.g. DEI, Engineering, Mindshare).
The Executive Sponsor is not responsible for doing the work directly, but rather as an advocate for the initiative and can help by unlocking resources, help unblock work, act as a consultant on Council and Project perspectives and generally supporting the initiative to allow the work to succeed.

An Executive Sponsor may find that they are no longer able to fill this role for a Community Initiative, whether due to an expiring Council term or that they do not have the capacity to continue.
In this event, the Executive Sponsor and the Lead must work together to identify another Fedora Council member who can be the Executive Sponsor.

[[proposing-sponsors-relationship]]
==== Relationship between Lead and Executive Sponsor

How the Community Initiative Lead and the Executive Sponsor collaborate is largely up to them.
However, it is suggested that the Lead and Sponsor have a regular meeting cadence (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) to check in on progress and identify challenges.
The Lead should provide updates to the Executive Sponsor on the work, engagement with the community, and requests for help in order to succeed.
The Lead should expect the Executive Sponsor to ask them questions, suggest other teams or people to collaborate with, and give suggestions on how to acquire the needed resources to succeed.
Periodically, the Executive Sponsor will ask the Lead to share progress or milestones back to the wider Fedora Council.


[[completing]]
== How are Community Initiatives Finalized?

At the end of the expected duration of the Initiative (as specified at the proposal / acceptance stage), the Council will assess the progress of the Initiative.
If all of the aims or the most significant of them are achieved, the Initiative will be terminated.
If the aims are nearly complete and further work substantially increases the impact, it may be allowed to continue for a further agreed period.
After that, it will be terminated.
Initiatives will not be allowed to run indefinitely.


[[current]]
== Current 12-18 Month Community Initiatives

This section documents the current Initiatives the Council have accepted:

[[forge]]
=== Git Forge Initiative 2025

Vision::
To empower Fedora developers and the Fedora community with a streamlined workflow through a consolidated Git source control and issue tracking solution, powered by Forgejo on Fedora Infrastructure.

Mission::
To consolidate Fedora's source code management, issue tracking, and project hosting onto a single Forgejo platform deployed on the Fedora OpenShift Cluster, replacing Bugzilla and sun-setting Pagure (src.fedoraproject.org and pagure.io), while offering a migration path for Fedora Project repositories currently hosted on external platforms.

Community Initiative Lead::
Ryan Lerch (link:{url_wiki}/User:Ryanlerch[@ryanlerch])

Executive Sponsor::
Aoife Moloney (link:{url_wiki}/User:Amoloney[@amoloney]), with Jef Spaleta (link:{url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta[@jspaleta]) filling in for Aoife's maternity leave

Timeframe::
18 months

Community Initiative Details::
See the link:{url_wiki}/Initiatives/Git_Forge_Initiative_2025[wiki page].


[[history]]
== History

See link:{url_wiki}/Objectives/Completed[completed Community Initiatives] and link:{url_wiki}/Objectives/Potential[potential Community Initiatives].

Historically, Community Initiatives were known as Objectives.
This transition was made in February 2023 following in-person discussion by the Fedora Council in our 2023 Council hackfest in Frankfurt, Germany.
We agreed to convert 'Objectives' into 'Community Initiatives', which the Council felt was easier to understand and communicate the roles of these efforts in Fedora.
There is no functional change to Objectives; it is just a semantic change.


= Communication in Fedora

As referenced on the xref:join.adoc[Get Involved] page below, Fedora is a massive global organisation with many people with different skills carrying out different roles.
As you get involved you may need to find assistance and the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] page can help you with that.
This current page goes into more detail around the various communication channels within the Project.

== Primary Channels

=== Chat

We now use https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Matrix/Element] as the primary synchronous channel to speak to each other in real time.

You can find a list of the Fedora channels on Matrix https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org[here].

=== Fedora Discussion

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Fedora Discussion] is the primary discussion forum where you will find all the latest news \&amp; announcements, as well as discussion about open source projects; workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Fedora Editions.
See also under xref:help.adoc[Getting Help].

=== Ask Fedora

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora] sits within Fedora Discussion and  is the main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora Project.
Ask Fedora is a good place to go for support and troubleshooting help, as mentioned on the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] page.


== Other Communication Channels

As above, https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Fedora Discussion] is now the primary platform for longer asynchronous discussions where short-lived chats may not be enough.
Some teams do still use mailing lists though.
The most significant mailing lists are:

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[announce]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test]

For a catalog of all the mailing lists look at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/[lists.fedoraproject.org]

https://fedoramagazine.org[Fedora Magazine] is a great resource for user-facing announcements and cool stories about usage, features, etc\&#8230;

https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Community Blog] brings you contributor-facing announcements and updates.
Within the Community Blog you'll also find https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/[Friday's Fedora Facts].
These are weekly posts with status updates, schedule info, etc..

The Fedora Pagure source control repository allows posting of  https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/issues[issues] which can be discussed, assigned and remediated.
Here you can raise issues or view, comment on, and request to act on open issues.

There are a number of official and other social media accounts, on various networks.
You can find details of these documented on the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_social_networks[Marketing Social Networks] Wiki page.

== Etiquette

In all our interactions, we aspire to _be excellent to each other_.
Read the xref:code-of-conduct.adoc[Code of Conduct] to learn more of what is expected of Fedora community members.


= Getting Help
There are several places to find help:

== Quick Docs
Firstly, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/[Fedora Quick Docs] is a collection of short HOWTO and FAQ style documentation for Fedora users.

== Fedora Documentation
Then there is the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[official documentation].
Many answers can be found here.
If you don't find what you need in the documentation or you need more detail, you can ask a question via the forums below.

== Fedora Discussion
Fedora has a strong community that is ready to help you.
Because users and contributors span the globe, a key element to the project is communication.
See the xref:communications.adoc[Project Communications] page for more details.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora] is the main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora Project within Fedora Discussion (below).
Visit Ask Fedora for support and troubleshooting help.

Within https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Discussion] you will find all the latest news \&amp; announcements.
It is also the place to talk about open source projects, workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Editions:
Fedora Workstation, Fedora Server, Fedora CoreOS, Fedora Silverblue, and more\&#8230;.

== Fedora Chat
https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Fedora’s official chat platform] (powered by Matrix) is the place to go for more synchronous, real time communication.
Fedora Chat on Matrix is the preferred platform for the future of Fedora Chat, however many of the Fedora Linux channels on IRC at Libera Chat are still bridged to Fedora Chat on Matrix to allow continued use of IRC during the transition.

If you're interested in \&#42;why\&#42; Fedora's primary communications are moving to Matrix, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2A8BdU1gKg[this presentation] on the Fedora YouTube channel by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller.

== Bugzilla
If you believe you've found a bug you can report it through https://bugzilla.redhat.com/[Bugzilla].
The xref:quick-docs::bugzilla/index.adoc['Using Bugzilla'] page will give you any guidance you need to do this.
You can also ask on https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora (as above)] to get advice on filing a good bug report.


= Get Involved

image:Welcome-to-Fedora-banner.png[Welcome to Fedora banner,100%]

Welcome to Fedora!

This guide is intended for people that are interested in learning more about Fedora, perhaps with the intention of getting involved and contributing to the community.

You can refer to the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] and xref:communications.adoc[Project Communications] pages for more specific information on how to find assistance via documentation and the various communication channels, such as Ask Fedora, and Fedora Chat (powered by Matrix).

== What is Fedora?

As described under xref:index.adoc[Mission and Foundations], the Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a Free and Open Source software platform:
the https://getfedora.org[Fedora Operating System], and its various editions.
You can learn more about the Project; our leadership; brand; current Community Initiatives and how we are organised using the pages linked in the left hand sidebar.


If you are looking to contribute and already have an idea of how and what to do, go ahead and get started!
If you are not so sure, read on.

== Contributing to Fedora

Fedora is a xref:orgchart.adoc[massive global organisation] where people with many different skills carry out xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[different roles] to keep the community ticking along.
All services used by the Fedora community are linked to a central Fedora account.
If you're intending to get involved you should get one https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[here].

There is an excellent https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-contribute-to-fedora/[article in Fedora Magazine] covering in some detail the various ways you might get started.

== Not sure where to start? Come hang out with us!

The large scale of the community can sometimes make it a little daunting for new folks to join us.
There is far too much happening in Fedora all the time---even we find it hard to keep up with it all!
So, if you are not sure of where to begin or have any queries at all, come hang out with the xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[Fedora Join Special Interest Group (SIG)] on any of our channels:

- Chat (over Matrix/Element): https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;join:fedoraproject.org[Join Fedora on Matrix/Element],

- Email: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Join mailing list],

Here, you can speak to community members and other newcomers while we explore Fedora together.
We will help you learn the systems and processes that the Fedora community uses, and as you gain a better idea of where you would like to contribute, we will also help you learn the skills that you may need.

Taking initiative is an important quality in successful contributors.
So, go on, join a channel and introduce yourself to the community now!


= Sponsorship

Fedora has thousands of regular contributors who give freely of their time and efforts on a continual basis.
Participating in the community is a great way to support Fedora.

Companies may also choose to sponsor the annual https://flocktofedora.org/[Flock to Fedora conference] or our other in-person or virtual events.
These events connect our community and power the collaboration that makes the Fedora Project work.
Sponsorships allow us to bring together contributors from around the world — including people who might otherwise be unable to join.
Contact mailto:sponsors@fedoraproject.org[sponsors@fedoraproject.org] for more information.

To mirror the package repositories, see the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring[Mirroring page] or xref:infra::index.adoc\&#35;_communicating[contact the Infrastructure team].

If you are interested in other sponsorship possibilities, please xref:council::contact.adoc[contact the Fedora Council].


= Fedora Code of Conduct
Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community, Organization for Ethical Source, Python Software Foundation, Emma Irwin
v2.1, 2026-01-15
:page-aliases: council::policy/coc-response-policy.adoc

The Fedora Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our community behaves and what we value to members and outsiders.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and if it is deemed necessary.

The Fedora Code of Conduct is not “code” in the sense of being an algorithm or a computer program.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is not “blindly and algorithmically” executed but is instead enforced by humans making real decisions based on all of the available information and using all available context.

The Fedora Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize non-native speakers of English.
Instead the Fedora Code of Conduct spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be acceptable or unacceptable.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is, in many ways, the outward embodiment of the Friends component of Fedora’s Foundations.


[[pledge]]
== Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as the Fedora community pledge to collaborate in a respectful and constructive manner, and welcome everyone willing to join us in that pledge.
We welcome individuals regardless of ability, age, background, body size, education, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and expression, geographic location, level of experience, marital status, nationality, national origin, native language, personal appearance, race and/or ethnicity, religion, sexual identity and orientation, socioeconomic status, or any other dimension of diversity.

Our channels, mailing lists, and posts should focus on Fedora and on free and open source software and content.
We pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.
We pledge to avoid personal attacks on others, and to avoid inflammatory language and speech that perpetuates discrimination.
Furthermore, we pledge to not use the Fedora Project and its platforms as a basis to engage in personal campaigns against other organizations or individuals.


[[standards]]
== Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

\&#42; Using welcoming and inclusive language
\&#42; Being kind to others
\&#42; Behaving with civility
\&#42; Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
\&#42; Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
\&#42; Focusing on what is best for the community
\&#42; Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

\&#42; The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
\&#42; Initiating controversy for controversy’s sake (repeatedly asking disingenuous questions under a guise of sincerity)
\&#42; Saying insulting/derogatory comments and making personal attacks.
\&#42; Repeatedly instigating conflict, and baiting people into arguments
\&#42; Public or private harassment
\&#42; Publishing someone else’s private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
\&#42; Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
\&#42; Violent threats or language directed against another person
\&#42; Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary statements, even if they were meant as jokes
\&#42; Excessive swearing
\&#42; Unwelcome physical contact
\&#42; Sustained disruption of talks or other events
\&#42; Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting even if the conduct may be legal under the laws of some jurisdiction.


[[responsibilities]]
== Our Responsibilities

The Fedora Council is committed to enforcing this Fedora Code of Conduct in a fair and impartial manner so that Fedora community members are able to participate in the Fedora Project and its associated activities in a safe and respectful environment.
To achieve this, the Council has delegated responsibility to a xref:committee.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct Committee] for clarifying and interpreting the standards of acceptable behavior, responding to and investigating reports of behavior that is not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct and determining appropriate and fair corrective action in response.
The Committee will perform these functions along with the Red Hat Legal team, as appropriate.

Within their respective areas of participation Fedora Community members have the right in their sole discretion and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct.
Those Fedora Community members are expected to exercise these rights in alignment with the Fedora Code of Conduct.


[[scope]]
== Scope

This Fedora Code of Conduct applies in all online and offline project spaces and in all online and offline spaces where an individual is representing the project, its community, or is acting as a community member.

Examples of acting as a community member include:

\&#42; Posting to a Fedora mailing list,
\&#42; Filing a bug with Fedora,
\&#42; Participating in official Fedora communication channels (i.e. Fedora Discussion, Fedora Chat/Matrix)
\&#42; Contributing to the Fedora Project in any form
\&#42; Using an official project email address
\&#42; Posting via an official social media account
\&#42; Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
\&#42; Speaking for Fedora or its subprojects at a public event or online video
\&#42; Working in a Fedora or related booth or table at an event
\&#42; Participating in a Fedora or related technical meetup
\&#42; Serving as an elected or appointed leader in Fedora, including being a member of the Fedora Council


[[reporting]]
== Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of behavior inconsistent with this code may be reported by contacting the Fedora project by filing a private Fedora Code of Conduct ticket at https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue.
If the incident occurs at an event, the local event staff should be contacted in addition to opening a ticket.

Individuals without access to https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue may send an email to the following address: codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org.
This email will be converted into a private Fedora Code of Conduct ticket by the xref:committee.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct Committee].

All reports will be kept confidential.
When we discuss incidents with anyone we will anonymize details as much as we can.
This means that the identities of all involved parties will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise or we are required to make disclosures under the law. Additionally, in some cases we may need to disclose this information to other parties at Red Hat.
Fedora is not a separate legal entity and therefore has to comply with all requirements imposed upon Red Hat.

Upon our review/investigation of the reported incident, we will determine what action is appropriate based on this Code and its clarifying statements.
An incident review will include communication with the reporter and the individual being reported, and an opportunity for both parties to provide an account of the incident.

All complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response.
Failure to follow this Code may result in actions including, but not limited to, warnings, temporary suspension, and in extreme circumstances, banning from the Fedora Project.
Please note, while we take all concerns/reported incidents raised seriously, we will use our discretion to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents.

[[retaliation]]
=== Our Stance on Retaliation

The Fedora Project is committed to ensuring that community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative consequences.
We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports a potential violation of this Fedora Code of Conduct or assists in its investigation.

[[protection-from-retaliation]]
==== Protection for Reporters and Participants

No one should face threats, harassment, discrimination, or any other form of retaliation for:

\&#42; Making a good faith report of behavior they believe violates this Fedora Code of Conduct.
\&#42; Participating in the investigation of a Fedora Code of Conduct report, including serving as a witness or providing information.
This protection explicitly extends to members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee in the execution of their duties.

'Good faith' means that you honestly believe the information you are providing is accurate, even if an investigation does not ultimately confirm the violation.

Acts of retaliation are serious violations of this Fedora Code of Conduct.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will address any confirmed instance of retaliation with appropriate corrective action, consistent with the enforcement of other Fedora Code of Conduct violations.
If you believe you are being retaliated against, please report it to the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee using the same reporting channels outlined in the 'Reporting and Enforcement' section.

[[false-reports]]
==== Addressing False Reports

We expect all community members to act responsibly when making reports.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will investigate all reports.
If the Committee determines, after thorough investigation, that a report was intentionally made with false information and with malicious intent (for example, to harass or silence someone), this action itself will be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.
An unsubstantiated report, when made in good faith, is not considered a false report.

= Clarifying Notes and Statements
Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community
v2.1, 2026-01-15
:page-aliases: project::coc-clarifying.adoc

The xref:index.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct] (CoC) outlines our shared values and standards.
However, applying these high-level principles to specific situations requires clarity.
The Fedora Code of Conduct and its associated documents are “living documents.”
They will change over time as the Fedora community changes.
This supplemental document serves as an extension of the main policy, to provide additional background and clarification to the Fedora CoC.
It ensures that enforcement is consistent and that community members understand how the Fedora CoC applies to real-world scenarios, including event visibility and the protections afforded to those who report violations.


[[visibility]]
== Visibility and Awareness

A Code of Conduct is only effective if the community is aware of it and understands the reporting procedures.
To ensure this transparency, the following standards apply to all Fedora operations:

\&#42; \&#42;Digital Presence\&#42;:
The Fedora Code of Conduct and its associated documents must be linked in the footer of all major Fedora websites and, where possible, in other project communications.

\&#42; \&#42;Event Prominence\&#42;:
All events must prominently display the Fedora Code of Conduct.
Organizers must publish event-specific notes, including designated points of contact.

\&#42; \&#42;In-Person Reporting\&#42;:
If an event supports in-person reporting, the specific process for doing so must be clearly and prominently displayed.

\&#42; \&#42;Physical Signage\&#42;:
In-person events organized by Fedora must provide physical copies of the Fedora Code of Conduct or display clear signage regarding it for attendees.

\&#42; \&#42;Online Events\&#42;:
Virtual events must display a link to the Fedora Code of Conduct prominently on the event home page.

\&#42; \&#42;Registration Acknowledgement\&#42;:
Where the platform allows, online events should require attendees to agree to abide by the Fedora Code of Conduct as a mandatory step in the registration process.


[[adapting-contributor]]
== Why was the word “contributor” from the Contributor Covenant adapted when it was adapted for Fedora?

We need a Code of Conduct that speaks to everyone who interacts with our community.
Many of us may understand the word “contributor” to encompass everyone from a mailing list participant, forum poster, bug reporter, documentarian, designer, developer, etc., but not everyone understands it this way.
Additionally, many of our events are attended by users.
Speaking about the community is a more clear definition of the individuals covered in this Code.


[[retaliation]]
== Rationale for Retaliation Clause (v2.1)

This update codifies a zero-tolerance stance on retaliation to ensure community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative consequences.
Any confirmed act of retaliation is considered a serious, standalone violation of the Fedora CoC and will be met with appropriate corrective action.
The new section explicitly extends protections to reporters, witnesses, and Fedora Code of Conduct Committee members acting in good faith.
Additionally, it distinguishes between unsubstantiated good-faith claims and malicious false reporting, establishing the latter as a violation to preserve the integrity of the enforcement process.

As of version 2.1, the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee has explicitly codified our stance on retaliation to close a critical gap in community safety.
It was determined that for the Fedora CoC to be truly effective, reporters must feel empowered to come forward without fear of professional or social backlash.
Silence caused by fear of retribution undermines the health of the entire project.


= Fedora Code of Conduct Committee
:page-aliases: project::coc-committee.adoc

The Code of Conduct Committee consists of the Fedora Project Leader, the Fedora Community Architect, and Fedora community members.
Members of the Code of Conduct Committee will be provided with incident response training and guidelines around Fedora’s xref:index.adoc\&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement[Code of Conduct].


[[members]]
== Members

The current Code of Conduct Committee is comprised of:

\&#42; Jef Spaleta
(xref:council::fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader])
\&#42; Justin Wheeler
(xref:council::fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect])
\&#42; Jona Azizaj
(xref:dei:roles:council-advisor.adoc[DEI Advisor])
\&#42; Dave Cantrell
(Fedora Council \&amp; FESCo member)
\&#42; Ankur Sinha
(Fedora community member)
\&#42; Chris Onoja Idoko
(Fedora community member)


[[responsibilities]]
== Responsibilities of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee

The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will:

\&#42; Accept, acknowledge, and investigate reports of possible violations of the Code of Conduct from community members and/or moderators.
This will include communications with people who submit reports, reported persons, witnesses, and Red Hat Legal, as appropriate.
This will also involve communications with other members of the Committee by text or video call to deliberate and resolve reports.
Additional details about the reporting and response processes are documented on the xref:index.adoc\&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement[Reporting Process Information page].
\&#42; In cases where a Code of Conduct violation has occurred, determine what action should be taken by the Fedora Project.
These will typically take the form of remedial guidance, a set of consequences for the reported person, and/or possible recommendations for new policies or rules for the Fedora Project.
\&#42; Accept and acknowledge requests for clarifications about the Code of Conduct, and provide a response once any necessary communications and deliberations are complete.
\&#42; Make reporting as appropriate about incidents, including an annual report summarizing incidents over the last year.
\&#42;\&#42; This report will be statistical in nature to illustrate the process is functioning.
\&#42;\&#42; Past reports can be found under the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/code-of-conduct/[Code of Conduct tag] on the Community Blog.


[[adding-removing]]
== Adding or Removing Members to the Code of Conduct Committee

The Fedora Project Leader and Fedora Community Architect are members of the Code of Conduct Committee, regardless of who holds these roles.
Ideally, the Committee should have at least three members at all times, and no more than seven.
The Fedora Council will be notified of all changes in membership to the Fedora Conduct Committee.
Adding and removing members to the Committee will happen from time to time for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:

\&#42; Particular Community members’ interest in maintenance of Fedora community health
\&#42; A Committee member no longer has the time or desire to maintain Committee responsibilities
\&#42; A Committee member fails to uphold the Code of Conduct Committee Commitments
\&#42; Disengagement or absence in Committee activities lasting beyond one Fedora Linux release cycle (i.e. ≥4 months)

[[adding]]
=== Adding a Member to the Code of Conduct Committee

To add a member to the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee:

\&#42; Current members of the Code of Conduct Committee or the Fedora Council identifies a prospective member and obtains interest in and commitment to participation, then files an issue proposing the member’s nomination.
\&#42; The Code of Conduct Committee reviews the nomination to determine eligibility.
Suitability will be determined by evaluation of the nominee’s behavior and track record of interactions in the Fedora community.
\&#42; If the nomination is accepted, the Committee invites the nominee to join the Code of Conduct Committee in a formal communication.
This invitation must include the xref:\&#35;commitments[Code of Conduct Committee Commitments] that members must agree to follow to ensure Fedora’s Code of Conduct is managed fairly and in a confidential manner.
\&#42; If the nomination is rejected, the Committee sends a notification of the rejection.
A rejected nominee will be eligible for renomination after two release cycles.
\&#42; Upon acceptance of the invitation and acknowledgement and agreement to the xref:\&#35;commitments[Code of Conduct Committee Commitments], Fedora will provide the new member with Code of Conduct incident management training.
\&#42; Addition of the new member to Code of Conduct incident tracker and documentation.

[[removing]]
=== Removing a Member from the Code of Conduct Committee

The process to remove a member of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee is notice from:

\&#42; The member to the Committee that they intend to step down, or
\&#42; The Committee to the member that they have been removed, and why they have been removed.

Followed by removal of the individual from the CoC incident tracker and documentation.


[[commitments]]
== Fedora Code of Conduct Committee Commitments

Members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee involved in investigating reports and making recommendations for resolution of Code of Conduct violations are required to uphold the following principles, ensuring that bias, lack of confidentiality and conflicts of interest do not impact the outcome of a Code of Conduct determination.

\&#42;\&#42;I agree to adhere to the Fedora Code of Conduct, in both letter and spirit, and acknowledge that violating the Code could result in removal from the Committee.\&#42;\&#42;

\&#42;\&#42;I agree to keep the process, any facts I learn, and any evidence I review confidential, and agree to discuss them only with individuals who are part of the process\&#42;\&#42;
(e.g. Fedora Code of Conduct Committee members, Red Hat Legal, or other designated individuals).

\&#42;\&#42;I will recuse myself if I cannot be fair and impartial in an individual case, due to my personal involvement with the parties involved.\&#42;\&#42;
If I have questions about recusal, I will consult the Fedora Community Architect and/or the Fedora Project Leader.

\&#42;\&#42;I agree that I will review Code of Conduct reports, conduct investigations, and make recommendations fairly and impartially.\&#42;\&#42;

\&#42;\&#42;I will review the reports and deliberate only in confidential sessions, with the outcome to be shared only with the parties and others as determined on a need-to-know basis.\&#42;\&#42;
(e.g. system administrators, moderators, or project leads.)

\&#42;\&#42;I will respect the process and outcome, recognizing that the Committee decision is the product of the Code of Conduct Committee, even if I do not personally agree, my recommendations are rejected, or I am part of the minority.\&#42;\&#42;

Please respond with acknowledgement that you have reviewed these commitments and agree to follow them in your role as a member of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee.

{team_summary}

The {team_name} is composed of a mix of representatives from different areas of the project, named roles appointed by Red Hat, and a variable number of seats connected to medium-term project goals.
Decisions are made by a \&#42;consensus process\&#42;, in which we work together as a common team to find shared solutions and address concerns, with a focus on giving voice rather than on balance of power.

The {team_name} is ultimately accountable for the Fedora Project as a whole, and is responsible for providing advice to and oversight of other Fedora governance bodies and teams as needed.

[[responsibilities]]
== Responsibilities

The {team_name} is responsible for issues of strategic importance for Fedora that require leadership and coordination across the various teams and sub-projects to achieve.
\&#42;Its primary role is to identify the short, medium, and long term goals of the Fedora community and to organize and enable the project to best achieve them\&#42;.
This is done in consultation with the entire Fedora community through transparent, public discussion.

{team_name} members engage with people across the community to make sure Fedora is functioning smoothly and that teams are empowered to do interesting and meaningful things.
They decide on issues regarding use of the Fedora \&#42;trademarks\&#42;, are responsible for final \&#42;arbitration of complaints\&#42; related to project policies and for \&#42;settling disputes\&#42; escalated from other committees or subgroups.
They may handle \&#42;sensitive legal or personnel issues\&#42; which require research and discussion to protect the interests of the Fedora Project or its sponsors.

To support project efforts with more ambitious scope, the {team_name} sponsors xref:project::initiatives.adoc[Community Initiatives] proposed by the community.
{team_name} members serve as xref:project::initiatives.adoc\&#35;proposing-sponsors[Executive Sponsors] for these Initiatives, working personally to ensure that the \&lt;\&lt;composition\--initiative-leads,Leads\&gt;\&gt; have everything they need to succeed.

The {team_name} \&#42;governs Fedora’s financial resources\&#42;, working with our sponsor to establish an annual budget allocated to support these Initiatives, various Fedora teams and programs, Fedora-managed events, and other activities which advance the Fedora Strategy.

The {team_name} is also responsible for developing, tracking, and updating the Fedora Strategy.


[[decisions]]
== Making Decisions

[sidebar.width33]
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;
Consensus decision-making aims to be:

\&#42; \&#42;Agreement Seeking:\&#42;
A consensus decision-making process attempts to help everyone get what they need.
\&#42; \&#42;Collaborative:\&#42;
Participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible.
\&#42; \&#42;Cooperative:\&#42;
Participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences.
\&#42; \&#42;Egalitarian:\&#42;
All members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded, as much as possible, equal input into the process.
All members have the opportunity to present, and amend  proposals.
\&#42; \&#42;Inclusive:\&#42;
As many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process.
\&#42; \&#42;Participatory:\&#42;
The consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers.

— from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making\&#35;Objectives[Wikipedia on Consensus decision-making]
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;\&#42;

Many basic decisions are made through a process known as “\&#42;lazy approval\&#42;”, in which general consent is assumed unless valid objections are raised within a period of time — generally three to seven days, although the timeframe should be stated each time and should be proportionate to the impact of the action.
This process is used for decisions with short-term consequences and which can be easily reversed.
Any project member can ask for the deadline to be extended or the decision escalated to require full consensus.

More significant decisions are made through a process of \&#42;full consensus\&#42;.
In order to pass, these decisions need three positive votes (+3) and _no_ negative votes (-1).
A negative vote immediately halts the process and requires discussion.
Therefore, in order to remain valid, negative votes must be supported with a specific concerns about the proposal, and suggestions for what could be changed in order to make the proposal acceptable.
A vote of “0” is sometimes used to indicate a disagreement but willingness to stand aside; this should also be accompanied with an explanation.

This model matches Fedora's “Friends” foundation, which calls for finding acceptable consensus to serve the interests of advancing free software.
It works because we work together in a community of mutual respect even when we disagree.

In general, the {team_name} conducts business in public discussion, and any Fedora project member can make negative or positive votes.
It is the duty of the {team_name} to take concerns raised in this way into serious consideration, but only {team_name} members' votes are binding in the final tally.

When consensus cannot be reached, the {team_name} may ask the xref:fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader] to decide on a resolution.
Such a request can be made when issues leading to negative votes are outstanding and all {team_name} members agree that the {team_name} is deadlocked, or if the dispute is unresolved after fourteen days and a simple majority of {team_name} members are in favor of the request.


[[composition]]
== Composition

[[composition--initiative-leads]]
=== Community Initiative Leads
On an ongoing basis, including sessions at Flock and in public online meetings, the {team_name} will identify two to four key xref:project::initiatives.adoc[Community Initiatives] with a timeframe of approximately eighteen months, and appoint \&#42;Community Initiative Leads\&#42; for each goal.
Each xref:project::initiatives.adoc[Community Initiative] is represented by one {team_name} seat.
Typically, this seat is filled by the Lead of the Initiative, although it is possible for two people (at most) to share a single {team_name} seat as Co-Leads.
While naturally the people in these roles will focus primarily on their own Initiative, this is a full {team_name} position and Community Initiative Leads are invited to participate in all {team_name} activities and decisions.

[NOTE]
====
This policy may be surprising, but we have found that this wider engagement connects the specific work to everything going on in Fedora, leading to greater success for the Initiative.
Community Initiative Leads may even serve as Executive Sponsors for other Initiatives.
====

Community Initiative Leads typically serve on the {team_name} for the duration of their Initiative.
When the Initiative concludes, the {team_name} term also expires.

Each Community Initiative Lead is paired with an xref:project::initiatives.adoc\&#35;proposing-sponsors[Executive Sponsor], who is another member of the {team_name}.

Community Initiatives must be documented with measurable goals.
The Community Initiative Leads are responsible for coordinating efforts to reach those goals, evaluating and reporting on progress, and working regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that progress is made.
xref:project::initiatives.adoc\&#35;proposing-sponsors[Executive Sponsors] are responsible for making sure the Initiative is on track and for removing blockers.


[[composition-representatives]]
=== Representatives

The {team_name} also includes five representative seats: an \&#42;Engineering Representative\&#42;, a \&#42;Mindshare Representative\&#42;, a xref:dei:roles:council-advisor.adoc[\&#42;DEI Advisor\&#42;], and two \&#42;Elected Representatives\&#42;.

[[composition--representatives--engineering-mindshare]]
==== Engineering \&amp; Mindshare Representatives

“Engineering” and “Mindshare” are broad areas roughly encompassing two of the major areas of activity in Fedora.
_Engineering_ is the technical work related to building and releasing the Fedora operating system and the infrastructure related to that.
_Mindshare_ includes marketing, design, and Fedora Ambassadors — largely activities that happen between Fedora and the world at large, with the distribution release cycle serving as a fuel source, not the thing that's being worked on.

The engineering and mindshare representatives' responsibility is to
represent their areas collectively, _not_ to be just an individual voice
that happens to be voted-in by some subset of Fedora.
They are selected by contributors working in those areas, under the rules of the xref:fesco::Fedora_Council_Engineering_Rep.adoc[Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo)] and the xref:mindshare-committee::procedures/council_rep.adoc[Mindshare Committee], respectively.

[[composition-representatives-dei]]
==== Diversity, Equity, \&amp; Inclusion (DEI) Advisor

The xref:dei:roles:council-advisor.adoc[\&#42;Fedora Diversity, Equity, \&amp; Inclusion (DEI) Advisor\&#42;] is a liaison between the {team_name} and the Fedora community on topics and issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in Fedora.
The DEI Advisor works with {team_name} leadership to represent perspectives and voices of the Fedora community in decision-making and project discussions.
This position is appointed by members of the xref:dei::index.adoc[Fedora DEI Team], with the approval of the {team_name}.

[[composition-representatives-elected]]
==== Elected Representatives

The elected positions cover all Fedora subprojects that are not under the engineering or mindshare banners, and the community at large.
One specific responsibility is to represent the voice of individual contributors to the Fedora Project.
Each representative will also work on specific goals which they bring to the {team_name} as highlighted during the election process.

Elections are held once per year, in concert with the joint Fedora election cycle.
Two seats are selected at the even-numbered release election, e.g F40, F42, etc, and each position has a two-election (approximately one year) term. This change came into effect from the F40 election, following a council vote on [https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/470 this ticket] at the 2024 council hackfest.
No person who currently holds another {team_name} seat can be elected.
If a seat becomes vacant, the {team_name} will arrange for a temporary replacement.

[[composition-appointed]]
=== Appointed Leadership Positions

[[composition-appointed-fpl]]
==== Fedora Project Leader (FPL)

The xref:fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader] (FPL) serves as the chair of the {team_name}, organizing discussion agendas, bringing issues to the table, and facilitating the consensus process.
He or she is accountable for success in all areas of the project, but is not a dictator, benevolent or otherwise.
The FPL often serves as the public face and collective voice of the project, and has a corresponding duty to listen to, understand, and fairly represent the collective views and needs of project contributors and stakeholders.

The Fedora Project Leader is hired by Red Hat with the advice and consent of the {team_name}.

[[composition-appointed-fca]]
==== Fedora Community Architect (FCA)

The xref:fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect] (FCA) works to grow the Fedora user and developer communities, and to make Red Hat / Fedora interactions even more transparent and positive.
The Fedora community budget comes to us through the Red Hat Open Source Program Office, and this position facilitates decision-making on how to best focus that to meet our collective objectives.

[[composition-appointed-foa]]
==== Fedora Operations Architect

The xref:foa.adoc[Fedora Operations Architect] (FOA) is employed full-time by Red Hat to assist the community in managing technical changes.
This includes oversight of the Change process, schedule management, communications, and ownership of key strategic efforts.
They also assist with the creation, improvement, maintenance, and execution of formal, repeatable Fedora processes.
Additionally, the Fedora Operations Architect serves as record-keeper and secretary for Fedora Council Meetings.


[[coda]]
== Coda

[[coda-meetings]]
=== Meetings

The {team_name} is not driven by meetings or by tickets, but does hold link:{url_wiki}/Council_Meetings[regular public meetings] (via a chat system or video call).
The {team_name} discusses current issues, clear through anything outstanding which can be quickly resolved, and to ensure that nothing urgent is left pending.
All members are expected to regularly communicate what is going on in their area, through blog posts or other public updates.

The {team_name} holds a multi-day, face-to-face meeting annually.
All members should strive to attend in person (travel funding is available).
We also often meet for a day before or after other significant Fedora-related conferences (Flock, DevConf.cz).
These meetings are not public, but minutes and summary documents will be provided.

Additionally, the xref:fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader] will set aside regular times to meet with the community.
Attendance is not mandatory for all {team_name} members but is encouraged.

[[coda-transparency]]
=== Transparency

The general policy of the {team_name} is to default to open.
Most meetings are held in public channels, and open to all Fedora users and contributors.
Discussion is held in a link:{team_asynch_communication}[public forum] open to all, and formal decisions will be recorded in a public ticket tracking system.

Occasionally, when personal, private, or sensitive issues need to be discussed, a video call might be used.
A private mailing list and ticket tracking instance also exist for these situations, but will also only be used when dealing with these uncommon issues.

[[coda-time]]
=== Time Commitment

Serving on the {team_name} is a significant commitment of time and energy.
Workload for the various roles will vary, but each will require a number of hours every week, and in most cases, the more, the better a {team_name} member is able to do the job fully.

We recognize that most Fedora community members do not have the luxury of working on Fedora full-time or as part of a paid position.
The time commitment required for these roles comes simply from what is required to lead a large project like Fedora, and is not intended to be an artificial limit on who can participate.
We know that that it can be a _pragmatic_ limit, and for that reason, the {team_name} is responsible for extra effort to receive, recognize, be responsive to, and meaningfully reward the input of contributors offering their individual time.

[[coda-governance]]
=== Governance Philosophy

To advance free software, we need to provide a sustainable integration of free software without cutting corners.
By providing a positive first impression before and during installation and real use, we support Fedora's reputation as a leading and reliable product that attracts future users and contributors.
To provide that integration and experience we must have a clear set of priorities to help all contributors decide how to allocate resources and resolve conflicts.
These priorities are not meant to be exclusive, or to keep contributors from working on the parts of Fedora that matter to them.

These priorities will sometimes expose gaps where contributors need additional assistance, and allow them to seek it both within the community and by bringing in additional contributors to help, exclusively on their particular interest area if desired.
While narrowing our focus in some areas, though, we must provide opportunities for exploration to all contributors within the framework of our core
values and without impeding progress.

[[coda-historical]]
=== Historical Note

The previous link:{url_wiki}/Board[previous governance structure (Fedora Board)] had five members directly appointed by Red Hat and five elected at large.
The current structure is more complicated but has a much greater proportion of members selected by the community by election or merit.
In the previous board structure, the xref:fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader] had a special veto power; in the current model, all voting members can block on issues, with a valid reason.
The FPL does not have a special veto, but does have a limited power to “unstick” things if consensus genuinely cannot be reached and a decision needs to be made.

[[coda--former-members]]
=== Record of Former Members

Former membership on the {team_name}, along with membership on the previous Fedora Board, is documented on the xref:history.adoc[History of {team_name} Membership] page.

= Contacting the {team_name}

The {team_name} uses three platforms for communications, one for asynchronous, one for asynchronous, and one for decision-making.
Anyone registered with an account in the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Account System] (FAS) can log in with their account to participate in either platform.


[[discussion]]
== {team_asynch_communication_name} (asynchronous)

The link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#42;\&#35;council tag\&#42;] on {team_asynch_communication_name} is the primary space for {team_name} conversations.
We use this for discussion within the {team_name} as a team, and it is also the best place for any community member to engage in or start a conversation with us.

[[discussion-private]]
=== Private mailing list

We also have a private mailing list: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/council-private@lists.fedoraproject.org/[\&#42;council-private\&#42;].
Its membership is restricted to the current {team_name} members and discussions there are not archived.
This list is only used for topics that cannot be discussed on the public forum.
We use it as little as possible.


[[chat]]
== {team_synch_communication_name} (synchronous)

{team_name} members are also often present on the link:{team_synch_communication}[\&#42;\&#35;council:fedoraproject.org\&#42; {team_synch_communication_name} room] on https://chat.fedoraproject.org[chat.fedoraproject.org].


[[decisions]]
== {team_issue_tracker_name} (decision-making)

It is better to start with an asynchronous conversation, described above.

When you have a specific proposal for the {team_name} to make a decision, open a ticket on the link:{team_issue_tracker}[\&#42;{team_name} {team_issue_tracker_name}\&#42;].
This is a public issue tracker.
However, if you have a privacy- or security-sensitive issue, check the \&#42;Private\&#42; box when you create the ticket.
If an issue is not sensitive, the discussion should open and public.

Note that ticket comments should be kept to a minimum.
Discussion should be at link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#35;council] and the ticket used to record procedural actions like votes and approved resolutions.

= The Fedora Project Leader
// Remember the one-sentence-per-line convention when editing this page.
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/\&#35;one-sentence-per-line

The _Fedora Project Leader_ (or _FPL_) is ultimately accountable for everything that happens within Fedora and in particular is responsible for maintaining Red Hat's relationship with Fedora and vice versa.
They are Fedora's President, CEO, Chair, Fearless Leader, whatever-you-want-to-call-it.
However the project leader is not a dictator, benevolent or otherwise.
The FPL chairs the xref:index.adoc[{team_name}].

//image::mattdm-2014-fedora10y-thumb.jpg[float='right',50%,link='https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/e/e8/Mattdm-2014-fedora10y-small.jpg']

link:{url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta[Jef Spaleta] is the current Fedora Project Leader.

Jef has more than a decade of experience in the technology industry; as software engineer, open source contributor, IoT hardware developer, operations, and developer advocate.
Prior to entering the technology industry as a paid professional, he was a plasma physics researcher. First in a Princeton lab work with fusion energy relevant experiments in New Jersey as a graduate student, and then pretty much everywhere but a lab building radars studying ionospheric plasmas as part of the SuperDARN international collaboration while living in Alaska.
During his period as an academic researcher, he also was involved in the fedora.us repository as a contributor, which susequently merged with Red Hat's effort to build what became the Fedora Project. Jef was even an elected Fedora Board member (the thing that pre-dated the Council) briefly before his trips to Antartica and elsewhere made it impossible for him to continue actively contributing to Fedora.
Now he's back serving the Fedora community after some time away.

He also curls..something he picked up in Alaska as a way to stay sane in the long winters there.

[[previous-titles]]
=== What about FCAIC and FCL?

The title of this role evolved and changed over the years since its inception in February 2015.
The creation of the role was largely envisioned and advocated for by xref:fpl.adoc\&#35;previous[Robyn Bergeron], then the Fedora Project Leader.
When the role was first created, the role title was https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-community-action-and-impact-job-opening-red-hat-osas/[\&#42;Fedora Community Outreach and Impact Lead\&#42;], which was often shortened to Fedora Community Lead (FCL).
At the time, the FCL role provided needed separation of responsibilities with the xref:fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader], including the role of organizing the annual Fedora contributor conference, Flock.
However, the FCL title did not feel totally right either.
Anyone can be a leader in the Fedora community, whether they are employed by Red Hat or not!
We did not want to imply otherwise.

Later, in October 2016, the role title was changed to \&#42;Fedora Community Action \&amp; Impact Coordinator\&#42; (FCAIC).
This title was lengthier but better captured what community engagement means in a large, globally-distributed community like Fedora.
Over time, more projects, organizations, and companies working on Free \&amp; Open Source Software (FOSS) introduced new roles in community management and leadership.
However, community work does not have an industry-accepted job ladder, as is more common with software engineering.
Red Hat eventually settled on the title of _community architect_ for community work in its pioneering Open Source communities.

Fast forward to 2023.
The landscape has changed and evolved!
So, it was the ideal time to reflect on the title for this role.
The title was changed in January 2023 to \&#42;Fedora Community Architect\&#42; (FCA).
Ultimately, the goal of changing the name was to better describe the role and what the FCA does in Fedora.
The lengthy 'FCAIC' title usually came with an explanation to others unfamiliar with Fedora and our community culture.
FCA is also a handy shortening of the longer FCAIC acronym too!

In 2007, Red Hat began providing Fedora with assistance through a funded role in the company’s Program Management organization.
In 2023, structural changes at the company eliminated this position.
The Fedora Operations Architect is a new role situated in Linux Engineering at Red Hat, designed to be more closely aligned in both definition and practice with Fedora’s unique needs.

All contributions, whether from a human author or assisted by large language models (LLMs) or other generative AI tools, must meet the project’s standards for inclusion.
The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for the entirety of these contributions.
. \&#42;Transparency\&#42;:
You \&#42;MUST\&#42; disclose the use of AI tools when the significant part of the contribution is taken from a tool without changes.
You \&#42;SHOULD\&#42; disclose the other uses of AI tools, where it might be useful.
Routine use of assistive tools for correcting grammar and spelling, or for clarifying language, does not require disclosure.
\&#42;\&#42; Information about the use of AI tools will help us evaluate their impact, build new best practices and adjust existing processes.
\&#42;\&#42; Disclosures are made where authorship is normally indicated.
For contributions tracked in git, the recommended method is an \&#96;Assisted-by:\&#96; commit message trailer.
For other contributions, disclosure may include document preambles, design file metadata, translation notes, or link:{url_wiki}/Category:AI_Assistance_Used[wiki page categories].
\&#42;\&#42; Examples:
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; \&#96;Assisted-by: generic LLM chatbot\&#96;
\&#42;\&#42;\&#42; \&#96;Assisted-by: ChatGPTv5\&#96;
. \&#42;Contribution \&amp; Community Evaluation\&#42;:
AI tools may be used to assist human reviewers by providing analysis and suggestions.
You \&#42;MUST NOT\&#42; use AI as the sole or final arbiter in making a substantive or subjective judgment on a contribution, nor may it be used to evaluate a person’s standing within the community (e.g., for funding, leadership roles, or Code of Conduct matters).
This does not prohibit the use of automated tooling for objective technical validation, such as CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, or spam filtering.
The final accountability for accepting a contribution, even if implemented by an automated system, always rests with the human contributor who authorizes the action.
. \&#42;Large scale initiatives\&#42;:
The policy does not cover the large scale initiatives which may significantly change the ways the project operates or lead to exponential growth in contributions in some parts of the project.
Such initiatives need to be discussed separately with the Fedora Council.

Concerns about possible policy violations should be reported via {team_issue_tracker_name} private tickets link:{team_issue_tracker}[to Fedora Council].

The key words “MAY”, “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, and “SHOULD” in this document are to be interpreted as described in link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg[License: CC BY 4.0]

This policy page describes how Community Publishing Platforms are defined, reviewed, and moderated.
It provides a loose framework of how moderation is handled in cases that link:{url_wiki}/Legal:Trademark_guidelines\&#35;Community_sites_and_accounts[involve the Fedora Trademark].


[[what]]
== What are Community Publishing Platforms (or, Platforms)?

\&#42;Community Publishing Platforms\&#42;, shortened as \&#42;Platforms\&#42;, are content-focused websites that publish Creative Works with the Fedora Trademark.
Platforms are places for expression of ideas and thoughts specifically related to or in the interest of the Fedora Project and its community.

[[examples]]
=== Examples

Creative Works include, but are not limited to, the following examples:

\&#42; Blog posts
\&#42; Pictures or photographs
\&#42; Public social media posts
\&#42; Other written communications depending on context

The {team_name} reserves the authority to modify or expand the definition of Creative Works, based on unique context of the Fedora Project and the Fedora Community.

Community Publishing Platforms include, but are not limited to, the following examples:

\&#42; link:{url_commblog}[Community Blog]
\&#42; http://fedoraplanet.org/[Planet]
\&#42; Specific social media accounts
\&#42;\&#42; https://www.facebook.com/TheFedoraProject
\&#42;\&#42; https://twitter.com/fedora
\&#42;\&#42; https://twitter.com/fedoracommunity
\&#42;\&#42; https://twitter.com/fedora_planet
\&#42;\&#42; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIfca4LPFVn8-FjpPVc1ow
\&#42;\&#42; https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/
\&#42;\&#42; https://discord.gg/fedora
\&#42;\&#42; https://telegram.me/fedoranews
\&#42;\&#42; https://www.instagram.com/thefedoraproject/


[[content]]
== What content is appropriate for Platforms?

Community Publishing Platforms feature Creative Works controlled by but not actively curated by the Fedora Community and Fedora Leadership.
Platforms may be provided on infrastructure or web services hosted and managed by the Fedora Project or its sponsors.
Community Publishing Platforms are not actively curated because they rely on decentralized community labor and contributions that are difficult to centrally control.

Creative Works on Platforms must comply with the xref:project:ROOT:code-of-conduct.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct].
These Creative Works are not officially endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, but must comply with link:{url_wiki}/Legal:Trademark_guidelines\&#35;Community_sites_and_accounts[existing trademark rules].
If the Fedora Trademark is used, it must comply to this policy.


[[report]]
== How to report a Creative Work

If you participate in an informally moderated Platform (e.g. Reddit, Telegram, Discord, etc.), work with Platform moderators first to report a Creative Work.
For the provided examples, this could be a Sub-Reddit moderator, a Telegram group admin, or a Discord server admin.

If you are unsuccessful in working with Platform moderators OR a Platform moderator encourages you to do so, follow the reporting guidelines in the xref:project:ROOT:code-of-conduct.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct].
Specific outcomes will fall under the scope of the Fedora Code of Conduct.





= Guiding Policy

This guiding policy represents the way the {team_name} would like the Project to make its mission a reality.

The Fedora Project's https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/\&#35;_our_mission[Vision] is:

____
_The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities_.
____

To accomplish this, our https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/\&#35;_our_mission[Mission] is:

____
_Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and containers that enables software developers and community members to build tailored solutions for their users_.
____

We do this within the context of the Four Foundations: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.


[[context]]
== Context

The {team_name} identifies the short-, medium-, and long-term goals necessary to keep the Project on the leading edge of technology.
The Fedora.next initiative focused the outputs of the project around use cases.
In 2017, we updated the mission statement to reflect changes in the computing landscape.
Today, it is too difficult to build new solutions in Fedora.


[[approach]]
== Our Approach

We will make it easy for the community to build solutions, address specific developer problems, and meet their end users’ specific needs.
We will do this by encouraging and helping Objectives which make the necessary changes required to ease the process.
This accelerates the transformation of Fedora into a community that enables the construction of solutions.

Internally, Fedora focuses on enabling these solutions to be built.
The outputs of Fedora are the Solutions our community members build.
Our focus on enablement allows experimentation without prior judgement or gate-keeping.


[[meaning]]
== What does this mean?

Teams such as Design, Documentation, Packagers, Release Engineering, and Quality Assurance provide building blocks and offer services to other community members and Teams.
Services and building blocks include the following:

\&#42; CI infrastructure
\&#42; Community building advice and guidance
\&#42; Event funding
\&#42; Logo services
\&#42; RPM or other software packages
\&#42; Swag
\&#42; Testing and validation
\&#42; User support
\&#42; UX design

Anyone may use building blocks like software packages and artwork to create a Solution.
Example solutions include: Fedora Workstation, KDE Plasma, and the Python Classroom Lab.
Teams define criteria for services they provide to solution-builders.
For example, teams providing press and promotional support may choose to provide additional support to Solutions with larger user bases.

Teams are free to define elements of their Solutions, such as intent, deliverables, and release cadence.
Teams can build Solutions from any building block and pick and choose what tools they use.
Based on their choices, they get different levels of ability to use the Fedora trademark (i.e. “Fedora Remix” vs “Powered by” vs “Fedora”).
Some solutions are the premier showcases that we call Editions; these are used in the gating tests for our releases.





= Policy Change policy

Proposed changes to {team_name} policies must be publicly announced on the link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#35;council tag on Fedora Discussion] and in a link:{url_commblog}[Fedora Community Blog] post in order to get feedback from the community.
After a minimum of two calendar weeks, the {team_name} may vote on the proposed change using the \&#42;full consensus\&#42; voting model.
After approval, the change is reflected on the xref:policies.adoc[{team_name} policies page].





= Process for promoting a Fedora deliverable to Edition

Fedora Editions are curated sets of packages, guidelines and configuration, and artifacts built from those pieces, that address a specific, targeted use-case.
The Editions are the primary Fedora outputs that most Fedora users are encouraged to use and directed towards through the download site.

This document describes the process for promoting an existing Fedora deliverable to Edition status.


[[what-makes-edition]]
== What makes an 'Edition'?

A Fedora Edition:

\&#42; addresses a sufficiently distinct, relevant, and broad use-case or user-base that a Fedora Edition is not currently serving;
\&#42; is a long term investment for the Fedora Project; and
\&#42; is consistent with all of Fedora's Four Foundations.


[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

\&#42; The candidate Edition must be backed by a team that holds regular public meetings.
\&#42; The candidate Edition must get trademark approval from the {team_name}.
If this includes a name change or a new name (e.g. “Fedora Bilverslue”), plan time for legal review.
\&#42; The candidate Edition must have a product requirements document (PRD) (link:{url_wiki}/Workstation/Workstation_PRD[example]).
The PRD is used by other teams within Fedora.
For example, the Quality Team uses it to develop release criteria and test cases and the Marketing Team uses it to develop collateral and positioning.
The PRD must include:
\&#42;\&#42; Market target, including key use cases and personas.
\&#42;\&#42; Core services and features.
\&#42;\&#42; Core applications.
\&#42;\&#42; Unique policies for installation, updates, etc.
\&#42;\&#42; Scope of hardware support (including anything that is explicitly unsupported).
\&#42;\&#42; Produced deliverables, and whether or not they should be considered release blocking.
\&#42; The candidate Edition may have a technical specification (link:{url_wiki}/Workstation/Technical_Specification[example]) that provides additional detail about the specific features described in the PRD.

[TIP]
====
It is helpful to have someone on the team assigned to handle the bureaucratic tasks.
====


[[process]]
== Process

When all of the prerequisites have been met and approved by the {team_name}, the team submits promotion as a System-Wide Change.
This ensures that Release Engineering, FESCo, and the community at large have the opportunity to provide input.
It also implies that the promotion may be delayed to the next release if the appropriate supporting pieces are not in place by the Beta or GA freezes.

Prior to submitting the Change proposal, the following tasks should be completed:

\&#42; \&#42;Approval from the {team_name}\&#42;.
File a ticket and participate in related discussion.
\&#42; \&#42;Review test cases and release criteria with the Quality Team\&#42;.
The Quality Team will draft test cases and release criteria based on the PRD.
However, the Edition team must verify that these are valid.
The Edition team may choose to assign a person to be the liaison with the Quality Team.
\&#42; \&#42;Work with Release Engineering\&#42;.
The Edition team should work with release engineering on how they are planning on composing the new edition, release process, mirrors sync locations, any changes needed to koji, bodhi or autosigning.

After the change proposal is approved, the following additional tasks should be completed no later than the Beta freeze, which should be considered the contingency deadline for the change.
Note that these tasks should be started as early as possible.

\&#42; \&#42;Request design deliverables\&#42;.
If customized graphics for the website, stickers, et cetera are needed, the Edition team should contact the Design Team as soon as possible.
\&#42; \&#42;Provide updated website content\&#42;.
The Edition team should send text, graphics, and screenshots to the Websites \&amp; Apps Team as soon as possible to ensure fedoraproject.org will be up-to-date on release day.
\&#42; \&#42;Notify Documentation and Translation teams\&#42;.
The Edition team should let the Documentation team know of any updates or new documentation required.
The Edition team should also inform the Translation team of incoming website and documentation updates so they can prepare to translate it in advance of the release.
\&#42; \&#42;Provide marketing blurbs\&#42;.
The Edition team should send basic promotional text to the Marketing and Magazine teams.
This will allow the release announcement, et cetera to include meaningful information about the new Edition.
The Edition team may consider writing one or several full Fedora Magazine articles in support of the Edition.


[[history]]
== History

This policy was approved in link:{team_issue_tracker}/issue/296[{team_name} ticket \&#35;296].

The policy was amended in October, 2024 to relax the 'distinct' requirement in link:{team_issue_tracker}/issue/507[{team_name} ticket \&#35;507].



= Event DEI Location Policy

This page describes the Event DEI Location policy, aiming to keep our diversity commitment in mind when organizing a event.


[[goals]]
== Goals

This policy goal is to make sure that a event location do not prevent people from coming due to discriminatory laws that would realistically impact attendance by marginalized members of the community. It was written with the LGBTQIA+ community in mind, but should not be restricted to it. To give a example, a law that prevent so-called 'LGBT propaganda' would create legal risk if the DEI team decide to have a meeting, and so we should refrain from choosing such a location for a international event. As another example, a law preventing abortion under any circumstance would make pregnant people be wary of coming due to the risk of not being able to get proper care in case of unforeseen pregnancy related complications. This policy is written to be supplemented with several criteria submitted by the community following the process to add criteria outlined in this document.

== Non goals

This policy does not attempt to take in account travels and/or passports/visa issues on purpose. While this greatly impact who can travel and would fall under the goal of increasing community diversity, this requires a different approach due to the complexity involved and the fact that it almost always requires a arbitrary decision that depend on the location of community members, the previous locations and current geopolitical climate as well as budget.

This policy also explicitly do not cover the event venue itself and the facilities used during the event, as this should be part of a separate document.

This policy do not cover smaller events organized by a local team (like a release party), as there is no expectation of international travel and the audience wouldn't see its situation change wrt inclusivity. However, the event are still bound by https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/\&#35;_our_standards[Fedora CoC]. Organizers are free to take that policy in account if their planned event aim for a audience spanning multiple countries and need to decide where to organise the event.

[[location]]
== Location evaluation process

Each covered event should be assessed by the Fedora DEI team in a timely fashion (within a month). The Council will then have to decide based on Fedora DEI team input, or take over the duty of assessing if the Fedora DEI team is not able to do the assessment.

\&#42; placeholder criteria (to be added later)

Feedback can be provided in advance before the formal review process is started, and community members are encouraged to become familiar with the requirements before submitting a proposal, and get in touch with DEI team if they have any questions.

=== Events covered ===

Only a event requiring international travel for a sizable portion of the attendees shall be covered by that policy. Smaller events aiming at a regional or national audience can be exempted of this policy.

For Fedora, this mean mostly Flock to Fedora, or a event that replace it, as it aim to get the wider community from all around the world. Hackfests tend to bring people from various countries and should be covered too.

[[criteriaevaluation]]
== Criteria evaluation

=== Laws priority order

Criteria must be evaluated using the material applicability of laws, with a focus on their locality. For example, if a country lack a specific law used in a criteria, but a applicable law exists at a lower administrative level such as a town and cover the proposed location, then the closer applicable law will be taken in account. To give a example, at the time of writing of this document (April 2024), same sex unions are not recognized country-wide in Japan. However, since the Ibaraki prefecture has a partnership system since 2019, a event in Mito (capital of the prefecture) would be covered, and so a criteria based on same sex unions recognition could be fulfilled.

=== Timing of laws application

The criteria would be evaluated at the time of the proposal and/or decision. If a law is proposed but not yet voted, then it shouldn't be taken in account. In a lot of country, there is plenty of laws proposed with most not being discussed nor being signed. If a law is not enforced in practice, but still exists, it should however be taken in account as if it was enforced. In the event of a imminent vote (1 or 2 weeks) along a rather high certainty of the result, a case-by-case exception can be discussed for that. Proposed laws can be brought during discussion outside of the process, and it is up to the Council to take that in account, especially if there is a need for a arbitrage between multiple locations.

=== Survey and perceptions

The criteria must be primarily based on laws, not survey or perceptions. The main reason is that surveys and perceptions can be hard to get in a consistent way across the world, and would requires to make a judgement call based on changing numbers, which is less clear cut than the presence or absence of laws. However, surveys and perceptions can be taken in account during discussion, on a case by case basis, especially if there is a need for arbitrage by the Council.

=== Importance

Each criteria will result either 'met' or 'not met' result. If a criteria is not met, it can be either a hard requirement (the proposal is rejected on that criteria alone), or a soft requirement (the proposal is not rejected just with that). Fedora Council can ignore a criteria (hard or soft), but it must provides a public explanation and a detailed reasoning for that. If all proposals for a event have at least one criteria that is not met, Fedora Council will need to start a arbitrage and should favor the one with the least amount of 'not met' criteria and the least amount of 'hard' and 'not met' criteria. It should also provides a public and detailed reasoning around the arbitrage.

[[criteriaprocess]]
== Criteria Addition Process

Anyone in the project can submit a new criteria in the policy by opening a ticket to the https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/[DEI tracker].

To be considered, a proposal must provides the following information:

\&#42; A name for the proposal. A pun in the acronym is not required, but always appreciated.
\&#42; The name/FAS ID of 2 persons responsible for pushing the proposal, answering to questions and submitting the changes and merge requests.
\&#42; A rational explaining how it is related to Fedora DEI team objectives.
\&#42; A criteria, in a short form of 1 or 2 sentences.
\&#42; A short paragraph explaining the impact on the community and on the conference attendance, ideally along examples of past issues, controversies in others communities or academics papers
\&#42; Whether the criteria is a hard requirement, or a soft requirement. A hard requirement would be harder to override than a soft requirement.
\&#42; A set of resources in English from authoritative sources such as specialized NGOs report that permit to assess the criteria at the time of decision. It should be up to date and cover all countries if possible, and can be complemented with more precise smaller regional sources. Exceptions can be accepted on a case by case basis.
\&#42; A set of 3/4 examples locations and how the criteria would be applied in practice. It must provides at least one accepted and one refused location, along the reasoning and justifications for the verdict. Locations should be provided as examples and do not need to be related to previous or future locations, but must use existing and contemporary laws at the time of the proposal.


=== New criteria approval

A proposal need to be reviewed and approved by the Fedora DEI team for adequacy with the team goals, then by the Fedora Council along the input of the Events team and any 3rd party that the Council may decide to consult.

The Fedora DEI team must use a full consensus approval as defined in its xref:dei::policy:decision-process.adoc[decision process]. The Fedora Council need to follow its own Policy Change process.

If the proposal fail to obtain a consensus by any of the approving parties, their decision must be motivated. If the proposers wish to amend their proposal and submit it again, the new proposal must be treated as a new proposal from the point of view of the process and obtain approval from Fedora DEI team and Council again.

People listed as responsible for the proposal can participate to the discussions but must refrain from casting any vote on their own proposal. A proposal can be withdrawn or set aside at any time by the proposers. Any substantive change to a proposal during the approval procedure reset the process to 0.

[[example]]
=== Fictional example of a criteria proposal

Name: Proposal for mandatory and adequate feeding of cats

Proposer: Ruby N. (rudebythecat@) and Sapphire N. (simp4ever@)

Rationale: Cats are very important and cute and important, and should be able to come without suffering from hunger or the psychological trauma of having water that is not fresh in their bowl.

Criteria: Flock should be in a place where cats are in charge and/or well fed and/or treated as divinities.

Impact on the community: Without having cats in charge, they might get underfed, and that's very very very bad. It would deter cats from traveling to Flock, and so reduce the cuteness of the community by reducing the feliness of the community, which is the 6th F of the 4 foundations. Cats are also good for people according to https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/hai.2021.0006[this academic paper].

Type of requirement: Hard

Resources:

\&#42; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_by_country_or_territory

Examples:

\&#42; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoshima%2C_Ehime[Island of Aoshima, Japan]: Pass, because the cats have the control of the island.
\&#42; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York[Rochester, NY, USA]: Not pass, because the food is hidden in a closet that is too high to reach.
\&#42; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkeetna,_Alaska[Talkeetna, AS, USA]: Pass, as there was a honorary cat mayor, so the cats can do a coup and get food.

= Additional Policies

\&#42; The {team_name} will have a regular face-to-face in November each year.
The region will be dependent on the location of {team_name} members at the time.
We will also conduct in-person meetings at Flock and DevConf.CZ for {team_name} members in attendance.
\&#42; Fedora Magazine is the venue for user-targeted communication and the Community Blog is the venue for contributor-targeted communication.
\&#42; The {team_name} supports greater efficiency in the infrastructure to allow more to be done, even when this means that we move away from self-hosted or self-maintained infrastructure.
\&#42; The Fedora Project wants to advance free and open source software and as a pragmatic matter we recognize that some infrastructure needs may be best served by using closed source or non-free tools today.
Therefore the {team_name} is willing to accept closed source or non-free tools in Fedora’s infrastructure where free and open source tools are not viable or not available.
\&#42; Because we value participation over strict bureaucracy ('Friends' foundation!) candidates for Fedora elections may be accepted within a reasonable grace period after the deadline.
However, be aware that this may mean missing out on Fedora Magazine interviews, town halls, and other opportunities for campaigning.
\&#42; The {team_name} has no objections to events being held in the local language or in English, and separate events can be held if there are multiple audiences.
We encourage event organizers to specify the language(s) for their event.
\&#42; Unspent budget allocated to the $150 event program will be pulled into the {team_name} budget at the end of each fiscal quarter.
\&#42; The {team_name} may choose to withdraw Fedora's support from events or other activities that involve fiscal sponsorship or use of Fedora trademarks when it determines that participation is not in the interests of the Fedora Project.
Decisions to withdraw support will be published in venues normally used for {team_name} decisions.
Deliberation and reasoning for the decision should be public to the extent possible.
The {team_name} will engage with the committee/group/team that is involved with the event in question to ensure their input is considered.


\&#42; Council Procedures



= Welcome to {team_name}

Welcome to the {team_name}!
You have just joined (or perhaps you are thinking about joining) and now you want to learn your way around.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help.
Ask for a mentor if you think that would help you.


[[expectations]]
== General expectations

\&#42;Be brave\&#42;.
You are on the {team_name} because you represent the Fedora community.
We expect you to share your ideas and opinions.
If you are the representative of another group (i.e. DEI, FESCo, and Mindshare Committee representatives), you are expected to speak on behalf of the group you represent.
Let the rest of the {team_name} know when you need help.
Share what is going well.
Communicate {team_name} goings-on back to the group you represent.

\&#42;Take action\&#42;.
The {team_name} is an active leadership body, which means {team_name} members should feel empowered to _do_ things, not just _discuss_ things.
You don't need to wait to be assigned a task.
If there's something that needs to be done, feel free to do it!

\&#42;Ask for help\&#42;.
Every member of the {team_name} was new at some point.
Don't feel bad if you need to ask for help or if something is unclear.
Think of it as finding a bug in the documentation!


[[access]]
== Access

When you were elected or appointed to the {team_name}, the xref:foa.adoc[Fedora Operations Architect] (or someone else) opened an issue in our link:{team_issue_tracker}[ticket tracker].
This provides a checklist for all of the places you need to be granted access.
Don't worry!
There's not much you need to do there.
If there is something {team_name}-related that you do not have access to, open an issue or ask in the link:{team_synch_communication}[\&#35;council:fedoraproject.org {team_synch_communication_name} room].


[[communication]]
== Communication

The {team_name} is working on improving some of our communication methods. We are tracking this work in [https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/536 ticekt \&#35;536] and will update our docs page with a new process once complete.
In the meantime, we try to have asynchronous conversations in the link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#35;council tag] on Fedora Discussion.
This is a public forum, so we expect—and welcome—input from community members who are not on {team_name}.
On the rare occasions when we need to discuss confidential matters, we have a private mailing list.

For synchronous communication, we use the link:{team_synch_communication}[\&#42;\&#35;council\&#42;] channel on chat.fedoraproject.org.
For very time sensitive or urgent confidential matters, we might use our private chat room on chat.fedoraproject.org. This is intended to be the exception and not the norm.


[[meetings]]
== Meetings

The {team_name} holds bi-weekly business meetings on \&#35;meeting:fedoraproject.org on Wednesdays. The Fedora Operations Architect creates an agenda in advance of this meeting in our [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council_Meetings meetings wiki page] and posts it to discussion.fedoraproject.org under the '\&#35;council' tag in Project Discussion. Minutes are posted as a reply to this post once the meeting concludes.
These are an opportunity to check on the progress of tasks and have conversations about open issues.
Attendance is not mandatory, but we encourage you to attend and participate as often as you can.
Business meetings are open to the community at large.
If the meeting time does not work for you, please propose a new time or ask for a poll.

Once a month, we try to hold link:{url_wiki}/Council/Video_Meetings[video meetings].
These are an opportunity to let the community showcase their work and ask the {team_name} and broader community for help.
Video meetings are open to the community at large.

From time to time, the {team_name} holds face-to-face meetings.
These are private and in-person when possible.
Attendance at these meetings is strongly encouraged.
The {team_name} will pay travel expenses when necessary.


[[tickets]]
== Tickets

Tickets are for discussing and voting on a specific proposal.
If you have an idea that needs broader discussion or brainstorming, start a thread on Discussion.

Procedures for labels, priorities, and voting on tickets are in the xref:procedures/tickets.adoc[Ticket Queue docs].





= Fedora Team Directory

In order to provide visibility into what teams exist _and are active_ in Fedora, the {team_name} link:{url_commblog}/fedora-council-november-2019-meeting-more-miscellaneous-stuff[decided] to maintain a directory that receives regular checks.
{team_name} representatives are responsible for periodic evaluation of the teams under their area (DEI, Engineering, and Mindshare).
'Teams' should be read as a catch-all term for groups in Fedora that may call themselves 'Special Interest Groups (SIGs)', 'Working Groups (WGs)', or any other similar term.


[[intent]]
== Intent

The team directory is intended to make visible:

. What teams are active in the community.
. How to contact them.

Fedora is a large community with many different activities, and the directory will help existing and potential community members find the team they are looking for.
Having periodic checks helps to ensure that the information is accurate and that we do not point people toward teams that are no longer active.

The intent is _not_ to increase the administrative burden on teams or the barriers to starting a team.
The intent is _not_ to say 'if you are not listed, you are not allowed to be a team in Fedora'.
However, presence in the directory may be used by other teams to evaluate funding or work requests (e.g. website work or design assets).


[[content]]
== Content

Teams should list the following information in the format specified by the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/blob/main/f/engineering/modules/ROOT/partials/TEMPLATE_team_info.adoc[template]:

\&#42; Team name
\&#42; Team summary
\&#42; Team website
\&#42; Team status (active or inactive)
\&#42; Team's preferred asynchronous communication channel (e.g. mailing list, forum category, etc)
\&#42; Team's preferred synchronous communication channel (e.g. IRC channel, Telegram room, etc)
\&#42; Team's issue tracker
\&#42; Team's meeting (preferably a link to a Fedocal event, alternatively a static day and time)
\&#42; Additional information the team desires to publish in the directory

[NOTE]
====
It is expected that not all teams will have answers for the above.
They should be provided when they exist.
====

Content may be stored in the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs[council-docs] repo if the team does not have its own docs repo.
If a team has its own docs repo, the content can be kept in that repo so that it can be used to render the team's own documentation.
This allows for a single source of truth and prevents content from diverging.


[[responsibilities]]
== Responsibilities

Teams are responsible for ensuring their entries are up to date.

The DEI, Engineering, and Mindshare representatives to the {team_name} are responsible for ensuring that the team that falls under their area keeps the information up-to-date and removes teams that do not appear to be active.
They are _not_ responsible for _providing_ the information.
Representatives may delegate sections of their area as they see fit.
Checks can be done at any time, but should be done around the branch date for each release at a minimum.


[[mechanism]]
== Mechanism

[[mechanism--info-files]]
=== Team information files

The directory requires a file that contains the information about the team.
The suggested naming convention is \&#96;NAME_team_info.adoc\&#96;, but any valid file name is acceptable.
The file may be stored in the team's own documentation repository or in the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/[council-docs repository].
See the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/blob/main/f/engineering/modules/ROOT/partials/TEMPLATE_team_info.adoc[example template] for format and structure.

[[mechanism-rendering]]
=== Rendering the directory

Teams will appear in the directory if the team info file is included in the \&#96;{engineering,mindshare}/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc\&#96; directory of the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/[council-docs repo].
After \&#96;include\&#96;-ing the info file, the index page must include the \&#96;team_render.adoc\&#96; file that defines the rendering.

[[mechanism--reusing-data]]
=== Reusing the data on team pages

Teams can include their \&#96;NAME_team_info.adoc\&#96; file on their page(s), and then use \&#96;{team_name}\&#96;, \&#96;{team_summary}\&#96; etc. anywhere on the page.





= {team_name} ticket queue

The {team_name} uses a link:{team_issue_tracker}[ticket queue] to track decisions and other work.
When opening a ticket to request a decision from the {team_name}, please describe the issue in detail but have an explicit question (or better, a proposal) to decide on.
If you are looking to start a discussion, consider posting to the link:{team_asynch_communication}[\&#35;council tag on Fedora Discussion] first.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not file Code of Conduct reports in the {team_name} issue tracker.
Those should be filed against the https://pagure.io/CoC/issues[Code of Conduct] issue tracker.
====


[[priorities]]
== Issue priorities

Currently, the {team_name} uses the following priorities for tickets:

\&#42; \&#42;Needs Review\&#42; (default):
The ticket needs to be triaged.
\&#42; \&#42;Next Meeting\&#42;:
The ticket should be addressed in the next meeting.
\&#42; \&#42;Coming up\&#42;:
The ticket is lower priority.
\&#42; \&#42;Waiting on {Assignee, Reporter, External}\&#42;:
The ticket is blocked on action or input from someone.


[[tags]]
== Issue tags

The {team_name} uses tags to indicate the topic of issues.
Multiple tags should be applied when appropriate.

\&#42; \&#42;budget\&#42;:
Big-picture budget issues.
\&#42; \&#42;code-of-conduct\&#42;:
\&#42; \&#42;documentation\&#42;

\&#42; \&#42;ticket-vote\&#42;:
Indicates an issue that should be voted on by {team_name} members.
\&#42; \&#42;trademarks\&#42;:


[[voting]]
== Voting

When a vote is called for, the \&#42;\&#42;ticket-vote\&#42;\&#42; tag should be applied.
{team_name} members should vote by leaving a comment of +1 (in favor), 0 (abstain/no opinion/weakly opposed), or -1 (opposed).
If multiple proposals or multiple versions of a proposal have been made, please indicate which the vote applies to.
{team_name} members can provide additional context explaining their vote, but should still indicate explicitly which of +1, 0, or -1 applies.

Policies for voting and approval are covered xref:index.adoc\&#35;decisions[elsewhere].

[[promotion]]
== Promotion

[[promotion-badges]]
=== Fedora Badges

Each year we generate a https://badges.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Badge] that survey recipients can claim when they submit their survey responses.
A ticket needs to be opened on the https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues[Badges repo] requesting the badge.
The panda graphic stays the same, and the year is updated accordingly.
\&#42;This ticket should be opened by April 1st\&#42; in order to give the Badges team enough time to generate the artwork, push the badge to the website, and provide a claim link to the Survey team.

[[promotion-badges-past]]
==== Past Badges

\&#42;\&#42; https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/800[Ticket]

[[promotion--community-blog]]
=== Community Blog Post

Each year we need to write at least two blog posts for the survey.
The first one is to promote taking the survey, the second features the released dataset and any findings.
These are published on the link:{url_commblog}[CommBlog], make sure to follow link:{url_commblog}/writing-community-blog-article/[the guidelines].
The promotional blog post should then be pinned on Discussion.fpo for the month the survey is open.

\&#42;\&#42; link:{url_commblog}/fedora-contributor-annual-survey-data-set-available/[Dataset]

[[promotion--websites-banner]]
=== Fedora Websites Banner

To help ensure we reach the maximum number of Fedora contributors, we promote the survey across as many Fedora spaces as possible including our websites.
This work is done with the assistance of the link:{url_wiki}/Design[Design Team] and the xref:websites::index.adoc[Websites \&amp; Apps Team].

The first step is to open a ticket on the https://pagure.io/design/issues[Design Team pagure] to get any updates on artwork.
\&#42;This ticket should be opened by April 1st, and closed by May 1st.\&#42;
If there are no changes from the Design Team, proceed with the previous design.
Once the artwork is finalized, a ticket is opened on the https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/issues[Websites \&amp; Apps Team] repo to get it published.
\&#42;This ticket should be opened by May 1st\&#42; and needs continuous check-ins.
The websites that we aim to cover are:

\&#42; https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/hyperkitty-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org/[Hyperkitty]
\&#42; https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Docs.fpo]
\&#42; https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Accounts.fpo]
\&#42; link:{url_wiki}/Fedora_Project_Wiki[Fedora Wiki]
\&#42; https://start.fedoraproject.org/[Start.fpo]

[[promotion--mailing-lists]]
=== Mailing Lists

A lot of folks are on multiple mailing lists so it is important to choose high level 'announce' channels over team channels.
A short email should be sent with a link to the Community Blog post as well as a link directly to the survey.

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/mindshare@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Mindshare]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel-announce.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Devel-announce]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/diversity.lists.fedoraproject.org/[DEI]

[[promotion--irc-twitter]]
=== IRC \&amp; Twitter

For increased visibility we also promote the survey on IRC and Twitter.
This should be done sparingly as their is a potential for it to feel spammy.
It could potentially go to other social media platforms but the main audience for that platform should be contributors not users.
Don't forget to remind people they can earn a badge!

\&#42; IRC \&amp; Twitter
\&#42;\&#42; (June 1st) Announce survey is open for month of June
\&#42;\&#42; (June 15th) Two week reminder to fill out survey
\&#42;\&#42; (June 30th) One day reminder to fill out survey

[[changes]]
== Storage and process to make changes

\&#42; Take markdown file in {team_name} repo
\&#42;\&#42; PR's reviewed and accepted to markdown file through out the year
\&#42;\&#42; git diff to locate the differences and make changes directly in the LimeSurvey UI two weeks prior to running survey
\&#42; Take the lss-file of the previous survey
\&#42; Upload lss-file to LimeSurvey under you personal account
\&#42; Add all changes from the Markdown file as accumulated over the year using Lime Survey interface
\&#42; Export lss-file and submit it as an update to this repository
\&#42; Share the update lss-file with LimeSurvey Wrangler so that new Survey is created under Fedora account.

= Fedora Governance Archived Pages
:page-aliases: historical/historical_note.adoc

Fedora has a long history, and things have changed along the way.
Sometimes, there are policy or procedure documents that have significance for remembering why things are the way they are and how we got here.

This section is for those, so they can be found in one place rather than scattered everywhere, and so they aren't accidentally lost forever in some future infrastructure transition.

We don't want to keep _everything_, and even of text worth preserving, this isn't necessarily the place.
But if you find something that you think is relevant to Fedora's guiding policies, overall governance, or similar, please submit as a pull request to the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs[{team_name} Docs].
Thank you!





= Stable Updates Vision
:page-aliases: historical/board_stable_updates_vision.adoc




[NOTE]
====
The 'Stable Updates Vision' was adopted by the Fedora Board in March 2010, and is referenced in the _current_ Fedora Engineering Steering Committee https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/[updates policy].
While some of the background factors have changed since then, the fundamentals which informed the FESCo policy are still relevant.
====


[[background]]
== Background

Discussions on March 2010 in various Fedora mailing lists have shown that we currently have a wide variety of positions on what Fedora's update strategy should look like.
These range from a _rolling_ release, to a _locked down security-only update_ solution.
The lack of clarity on this issue contributes to confusion among package maintainers and end users alike.

Most people agree that broken updates are detrimental to the Fedora distribution and should be avoided.

Fewer people agree on:

\&#42; How many updates are acceptable for a stable release and how to measure them.
\&#42; What constitutes an acceptable update to a stable release.
\&#42; At what cost should broken updates be avoided, trading off occasional broken updates for delivery speed for new software and maintainer workflow simplicity.

For these reasons, the Fedora Board is issuing a stable release update vision statement to help guide the creation and implementation of a Fedora Updates policy.
This policy is not meant to govern the introduction of new packages.

By creating this statement, it is the Board's belief that:

\&#42; End-user satisfaction with our distribution will increase
\&#42; Developers and end-users will have a more solid stable release experience
\&#42; End-users and developers will have more time to focus on other areas in Fedora


[[factors]]
== Factors

When creating an updates overview, there are some factors that need to be taken into account.
The first, and foremost, is keeping in mind https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2009-October/msg00350.html[the broad criteria] the Board set out for the target audience of the entire Fedora distribution, which describe someone who:

. is voluntarily switching to Linux
. is familiar with computers but is not necessarily a hacker or developer
. is likely to collaborate in some fashion when something's wrong with Fedora, and
. wants to use Fedora for general productivity, either using desktop applications or a Web browser.

A shifting platform and visible behavioral changes will affect the user's productivity because the user must take time away from the desired tasks to discover what has changed, adjust the way they perform supporting tasks, and refocus on their original objectives.
Because productivity is postulated as important to this user, this outcome is undesirable.
Similarly, dealing with a large number of updates on a regular basis is distracting from the user's desired productivity tasks.

Updates offered by our built-in tools under the auspices of the Fedora Project are seen as authoritative by users.
While a user fitting these criteria is likely to file a bug when something goes wrong, the user does not therefore automatically expect new issues to emerge in a stable release as a result of consuming those updates.
When such issues do emerge, the user's confidence in the platform is undermined.

Another factor to keep in mind is Fedora's rapid development cycle.
A six-month development cycle for a release allows Fedora to integrate the latest and greatest releases from upstream projects into the 'rawhide' distribution and have that body of work available to the user base in a relatively short amount of time.
Ideally, this rapid paced release cycle allows both developers and users the chance to focus on a coherent, consistent, and well functioning set of software content per release.


[[vision_statement]]
== Vision Statement

Taking the background and various factors above into account, the Board believes update streams should be managed with the following purposes in mind:

\&#42; The update repositories for stable releases of the Fedora distribution should provide our users with a consistent and high quality stream of updates.
\&#42; Stable releases should provide a consistent user experience throughout the lifecycle, and only fix bugs and security issues.
\&#42; Stable releases should not be used for tracking upstream version closely when this is likely to change the user experience beyond fixing bugs and security issues.
\&#42; Close tracking of upstream should be done in the Rawhide repo wherever possible, and we should strive to move our patches upstream.
\&#42; More skilled and/or intrepid users are encouraged to use xref:releases:rawhide.adoc[_Rawhide_] along with participating in testing of stable branches during the development and pre-release period.
\&#42; Stable releases, pre-release branches, and Rawhide have a graduated approach to what types of updates are expected.
For example, a pre-release branch should accept some updates which a stable release would not, and rawhide would accept updates that are not appropriate for either a stable release or a pre-release.
\&#42; Project members should be able to transparently measure or monitor a new updates process to objectively measure its effectiveness, and determine whether the updates process is achieving the aforementioned vision statements.

Following the Fedora Board vision statement, the following policy was approved and in effect from October 2010:
