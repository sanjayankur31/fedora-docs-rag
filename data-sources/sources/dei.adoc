= Past Fedora DEI Team Activities

This page preserves historical content from the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Team for transparency and reference.
While these initiatives are no longer active or current focus areas, their legacy contributed to today’s DEI work.

[[fedora-women]]
== Fedora Women

The *Fedora Women* initiative aimed to nurture the involvement of women
(cis and trans) and gender-queer people in Fedora and other Free and Open
Source Software projects.

This community worked to bring awareness to contributions by women and
non-binary contributors in Fedora.

Although the Fedora Women team is no longer active, many of its goals have evolved into broader efforts, such as the xref:dei::fedora-week-of-diversity.adoc[*Fedora Week of Diversity (FWD)*].

[[demographic-survey]]
== Demographic Survey (2015/2016)

In 2015/2016, the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Team drafted a *demographic survey* to better understand the composition of the Fedora community.

Due to data storage concerns, privacy issues, and evolving regulations like GDPR, this survey was never launched.

You can check out more about it here in the Demographic survey section.

[[events]]
== Events

We still run active events like Fedora Week of Diversity (FWD) to support
diversity in our community, and in open source in general.
You can also look at the past events section to see what we’ve done before, and follow our channels to stay updated on this year’s events.

= About Fedora Project Demographic Survey
Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team <diversity@lists.fedoraproject.org>
:toc:

This section documents the Fedora Project Demographic Survey research.
This was work completed between 2016 to 2018 to launch a demographic survey to understand the Fedora Community.
Because of legal concerns around recent data legislation passed in this time period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation[G.D.P.R.]), the survey was planned but never published.

A majority of this work was completed at the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-diversity-fad-2017/[Fedora Diversity FAD] in January 2017.

[NOTE]
====
This page represents six to eight months of work from the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team in late 2015 and early 2016.
While the D.E.I. Team is *no longer actively working on this survey* due to data collection and storage concerns (i.e. G.D.P.R.), it is retained here for historical purposes.
The team hopes our research and work may be useful for other Open Source communities and Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion programmes.

[[objectives]]
== Objectives

The Fedora Project Demographic Survey established these key objectives for launching such a survey:

[[understand]]
=== 1. Understand baseline demographics about the Fedora Community.

* *Why this objective was important*:
Enables Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team to identify different areas of need for contributing to Fedora, and prioritize to act on areas of most-immediate need.
* *Examples of target criteria*:
** Age
** Gender
** Race and cultural background
** Geographic area or region
** Disability
** Parents and families
** Non-English languages

[[support]]
=== 2. Support underrepresented groups by supplementing on-boarding resources to other Fedora teams.

* *Why this objective was important*:
** Collaborate and support on-going work in other Fedora Teams by advising mentorship and teaching programs in Fedora Community
** Disseminate best practices through mentorship and community on-boarding
* *Examples of possible partnering teams*:
** xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[Join SIG]
** Mentoring and internship programs
(GSoC and Outreachy)
** xref:fedora-join::classroom/classroom.adoc[Fedora Classrooms]


[[misc-comments]]
== Miscellaneous comments

When the survey was first drafted in late 2016 and early 2017, several comments, ideas, and xref::resources.adoc[resources] influenced the design of the survey and an outreach campaign for it.
Some of the pending and unresolved notes are below for archival purposes.

[quote,Bee Padalkar (bee2502)]
____
* How were you introduced to Fedora?
.. By another Fedora contributor
.. At a Fedora event
(e.g. FAD / workshop / meetup / release party)
.. Conference
.. Hackerspace
.. Red Hat
.. Web / online
* What makes contributing to Fedora difficult for you?
____

We also wanted to identify how the data will be used.
We aimed to make a communication plan for how the data would be used.
Ideally, information about data use and intentions is available and embedded in the survey.

= Fedora and Outreachy

Fedora proudly participates in Outreachy to foster diversity, equity, inclusion, and long-term contributor growth in open source.

== What is Outreachy?

https://www.outreachy.org/[Outreachy] provides paid, remote internships to people underrepresented in tech. Fedora participates regularly and mentors a range of Outreachy projects - from technical to community-focused welcoming newcomers into our open source world.

The internship runs twice a year, and lasts 3 months.

Our goal is to increase participation in Fedora. Please see https://www.outreachy.org/apply/[the main page] with program details for the general information, such as timeline, background information, eligibility, requirements, and the application form.

== Why do Fedora participate in the Outreachy program?

Fedora believes in building an inclusive project where everyone has the opportunity to contribute, grow, and lead.
We see Outreachy as a vital part of this. It helps:

* Support underrepresented contributors
* Grow new long-term community members
* Strengthen Fedora’s diversity and mentorship culture

== Outreachy interns
We maintain a full list of Outreachy interns and their contributions in our Mentored Projects documentation.

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mentored-projects/outreachy/faq/[View all Fedora Outreachy interns and their contributions here.]

(If you’re curious about Outreachy? https://www.outreachy.org/[Find out more and apply]. If you get in and work with Fedora, you’ll be on our list too.)

== How Fedora Mentors Interns

Fedora mentors follow a supportive, flexible approach:

* Async support via Matrix and GitLab(any other active git forges we use)
* Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
* Clear tasks tracked in GitLab Issues
* Encouragement to blog, present, and engage

Mentorship is about collaboration, learning, and helping interns grow into confident, long-term contributors — not just finishing tasks.

== Life beyond Outreachy

Outreachy doesn’t stop when the internship ends. For many it’s just the beginning. Many Outreachy alums keep contributing, join SIGs, run workshops, and even become speakers. This section highlights how the journey continues, because the goal isn’t just contribution but also belonging.

* *Roseline Bassey (Outreachy 2024)* had her talk https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/ED3YLJ/[“Scaling Fedora Ready Through Community Contributions”] presented at Flock 2025 by Fedora Community Architect Justin Wheeler.
* *Nikita Tripathi (Outreachy 2022)* gave a talk at Flock 2025 on https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/JS9BHV/[“Open Source Mentorship: Crafting Community Leaders,”] where she shared what mentorship is (and isn’t), and why engagement and support matter.

== Success tips for applicants

You can check this post from Cornelius Emase for real-life experience and tips from mentors:

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/why-i-got-selected-for-fedora-outreachy-and-what-might-help-you-too/155348[“Why I got selected for Fedora Outreachy — and what might help you too”]

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Do I need to be a coder?::
Nope! Fedora welcomes all kinds of skills — writing, design, community organizing, QA, translation, and more. If you love open source and want to learn, there’s a place for you.

Do I need to know Fedora already?::
Not at all. Curiosity and effort matter more than deep technical knowledge. Many interns start from zero and grow fast by just asking questions and showing up.

I’m nervous — what if I mess up? ::
You won’t be alone. Fedora contributors are here to support you. You just need to try, be respectful, and learn from the process. Nobody expects perfection — just progress.

What kind of projects can I work on?::
Fedora offers technical and non-technical projects — from packaging and automation to design, docs, community outreach, and research. Each project has mentors to guide you along the way.

Will I get mentorship support regularly? ::
Yes. Mentors are expected to communicate regularly — through Matrix, email, GitLab, or scheduled check-ins — to help you stay on track and feel supported throughout the internship.

= Get involved with {team_name}

The {team_name} always welcomes new contributors.
Whether you are a newcomer or an old-timer, whether you can contribute frequently or sporadically, there are ways to get involved.
As a {team_name} member, you can:

* Work closely with Fedora leadership to build initiatives from the ground-up which shape Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion in Fedora community.

Interested in helping the {team_name}?
This page explains the typical process for getting involved with our team.


[[create-fas-account]]
== Create Fedora Account System (FAS) account

All contributors to Fedora need to register in the link:https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Account System].
New contributors are asked to sign the xref:legal::fpca.adoc[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement] (FPCA).
This is not a copyright assignment agreement, but ensures your contributions to Fedora have acceptable licensing terms.
If you need help with this, contact the xref:infra::day_to_day_fedora.adoc[Fedora Infrastructure Team].


[[forum]]
== Discourse forum

We have a tag on link:{team_asynch_communication}[Fedora Discussion] (the Fedora community forum) where team topics are discussed.

[[forum-introduction]]
=== Introduce yourself

If you want to get involved, we want to get to know you!
*Post a self-introduction on the link:{team_asynch_communication}[#dei-team tag on Fedora Discussion]*.
This is a helpful step for other folks on the {team_name} to get to know you.

Not sure what to say?
Consider these questions when introducing yourself:

* Are you new to the Fedora community?
If so, what was interesting to you about Fedora?
* Are you involved with other communities?
Tell us about what you do in other communities or projects.
* Do you already contribute to Fedora?
Let us know what parts of Fedora you are involved in.
* Are you an organizer of local events or programs?
If you run any kind of event in your local community, let us know what you do.
* What is interesting to you about the {team_name}?
Our team is a collection of people with different interests and niches.
Knowing each others' interests and what we like lets us connect each other to things we want to help out with.


[[chat]]
== Join Matrix chat room

The {team_name} has a real-time chat room on Matrix.
We use the chat room for quick updates, friendly chatter, and running meetings.
Use link:{team_synch_communication}[this link] to join from your preferred Matrix client.
Don't forget to say hi when you join!


[[attend-meeting]]
== Attend a meeting

link:{team_meetings}[**Find our next meeting on our calendar!**]

The {team_name} usually holds a fortnightly meeting over Jitsi Meet to review ongoing work and plan new work.
It is a good opportunity to say hello and meet other team members in real-time while seeing how we work.
See the xref:meetings.adoc[team meeting guide] for how our meetings work, including the xref:meetings.adoc#social-agreement[social agreement] and xref:meetings.adoc#format[meeting format].


[[tickets]]
== Ticket-based task management

The next step to get involved is to review our ticket tracker and look for a task that is interesting to you.
Our open tickets are in our link:{team_issue_tracker}[GitLab repository].
New tasks are added as "issues" into GitLab.

See a ticket that looks interesting?
If someone is not already assigned, leave a comment and ask how you can help.
Another member of the team will get back to you with feedback.
This is an opportunity to get casual mentoring on a task.

Alternatively, do you think something is missing or could be improved in the Fedora community?
Open a new ticket with your idea or suggestion.
Our best ideas come from a wide range of people with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.
Whether you are new to the Fedora community or are a long-time contributor, you might have the next great idea for the team.
Open a new ticket and we can discuss more about your idea or suggestion.


[[sponsorship]]
== Team sponsorship

When someone is considered a full voting member of the {team_name}, we call this person a *sponsored member*.
After spending time contributing with the {team_name}, you can join the team in a formal capacity as a full voting member.
The process to become sponsored is as follows:

. Talk to a member(s) of the {team_name} to find a sponsor.
You can see a list of sponsored team members in the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/diversity-team/[`diversity-team` Fedora Account System group].
. Sponsor will open a "New Team Member" ticket on the {team_name} ticket tracker.
. Ticket will be open for two weeks for others members to vote and/or give commentary about your team membership.
.. If we do not reach consensus in the two-week period, it can be extended for another two weeks.
.. A negative vote halts the process and requires discussion.
. Full consensus is required for you to join the {team_name}.
This means at least three +1 votes and no -1 votes.
. If consensus is met, you will then be added to the Fedora Account System (FAS) group.

Sponsors will evaluate your membership in a couple of ways:

* *Ability to work cooperatively with peers*.
** By the interactions potential members have in meetings and in channel.
** By how potential members respond to criticism.
** By how potential members participate on the forum, chat room, and ticket trackers.
* *Community involvement beyond the {team_name}*.
** By the interactions potential members have in the Fedora community.
** Does the potential member engage on the forum, chat room, and ticket trackers?
Do they show a helpful attitude and respect for other ideas of others?
* *Commitment and follow-through*.
** By time already given to the {team_name}.
** By how well potential members stick with the process through tough issues.
** By how potential members engage on difficult topics in a constructive way.
** By regularly showing up in meetings or the chat rooms.

= Team meeting guide

This guide contains instructions and recommendations for running {team_name} meetings.


[[social-agreement]]
== Social agreement

The social agreement is our social rules and etiquette for how we treat each other during meetings.
This keeps our meetings productive and gives everyone an opportunity to be heard:

* Focus on listening
* Stay present as much as possible, refrain from email/chat/etc
* Let everyone have a chance to speak, be aware of how much time you are talking
* Be mindful of the meeting schedule and help to move the dialog forward
* Use the raise hand function
* Stay on mute when you are not speaking


[[format]]
== Format

Since 24 October 2020, the {team_name} adopted this format for structuring team meeting agendas:

. Intros, welcomes, hellos
(5 minutes)
. Team announcements & news
(5-10 minutes)
. Follow-ups from last meeting, if any
(5-10 minutes)
. Ticket discussions
(remaining time)
. Open floor
(final 5-10 minutes)


[[add-ticket]]
== How to add a ticket to meeting agenda

Add a GitLab issue to the next meeting agenda by adding them to a *milestone* for the current quarter of the year.
First, open a GitLab issue and look in the metadata sidebar to the right.
Then, click _Edit_ in the _Milestone_ section in the sidebar.
Several options should appear in the dropdown menu that appears, e.g. _2024 Q4 Team Goals_.
Choose the milestone that corresponds to the current quarter.
Once selected, the GitLab issue will appear under the milestone.
The {team_name} uses GitLab milestones to triage discussions for our meetings.

image::meetings/gitlab-update-issue-milestone.png[Screenshot of how to update the milestone of a GitLab issue]


[[meetbot]]
== Meetbot command script

Since late 2023, Fedora uses *Meetbot* for running text-based meetings from our Matrix meeting rooms, e.g. `#meeting:fedoraproject.org`
Meetbot recognizes several commands to start a logged meeting that will generate a summary once the meeting ends.
This section includes a sample script for a Meetbot-powered meeting on Fedora Chat.

= Decision-making process

This page describes how the Fedora D.E.I. team makes decisions.


[[process]]
== Process

Members of the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/diversity-team/[Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team FAS group] are eligible to vote.

=== Lazy Approval

This means general consent is assumed unless valid objections are raised within a specific period of time i.e. 5 days along with minimum two positive vote (+1) and no -1's.
Votes can be cast by any approved member of diversity team.
This process is used for decisions with short-term consequences and which can be easily reversed.
Any team member can ask for the deadline to be extended or the decision escalated to require full consensus.

=== Full Consensus

More significant decisions are made through a process of full consensus.
In order to pass, these decisions need three positive votes (+3) and no negative votes (-1) within a specific period of time i.e. 14 days.
The votes can be cast by any of the approved members in the FAS group for the Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team.
A negative vote immediately halts the process and requires discussion.
Therefore, in order to remain valid, negative votes must be supported with a specific concern about the proposal, and suggestions for what could be changed in order to make the proposal acceptable.


== Choosing a process

*Lazy approval* is followed for tasks with a defined process in D.E.I. Team.
When all prior steps for a task are completed with just the ticket-based approval remaining.
For example, translating an article or proposing a Flock session fit in this model.

*Full consensus* is required to approve new processes, make changes to existing team policies, and tickets requiring D.E.I. budget.
For example, proposing new event guidelines for events, changing the decision-making process, and voting on Outreachy budget allocation requires full consensus.

You can learn more about Jona link:{FWIKI}/User:Jonatoni[on her Fedora wiki userpage].


[[duration]]
== Duration of service

The DEI Advisor will serve until they wish to step down, or the Council or the DEI Team wish to replace them.
The recommendation for duration of service is two Fedora release cycles, or *one year*.
However, terms may (xref:#history[and have]) run shorter or longer depending on the personal situation of the person filling the Advisor role.

In the event that the DEI Advisor, Council, or DEI Team wish to make a change in the Advisor, sufficient reason should be given.
A new DEI Advisor will then be xref:#selection[selected] by the DEI Team.


[[responsibilities]]
== Responsibilities

The Fedora DEI Advisor is a liaison between the Fedora Council, the Fedora DEI Team, and the Fedora community.
The following responsibilities and duties are delegated to the DEI Advisor.

[[responsibilities-council]]
=== To Fedora Council

* Participate in two to three Council hackfests a year
(xref:#hackfest[_what is a hackfest?_]).
* Participate in two to three Council meetings a month, as representative of the DEI Team.
* Identify collaboration opportunities with Fedora Council responsibilities, Fedora DEI Team objectives, and the Fedora community.
* Optionally, serve as an xref:project::initiatives.adoc#proposing-sponsors[Executive Sponsor] of a Fedora xref:project::initiatives.adoc[Community Initiative].

[[responsibilities-council-examples]]
==== Examples

* *Council Hackfests*:
See the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/february-2023-council-hackfest-summary/[February 2023 Council hackfest report].
https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/331[Fedora-Council/tickets#331] also shows an example of the planning for a hackfest.
* *Council meetings*:
Sometimes https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council_Meetings[in text], sometimes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0x39xti0_64uSci6Wqk_E-IMSyq6vEuE[on video].
* *Collaborations*:
See https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/306[Fedora-Council/tickets#306], which discussed renaming the dist-git default branch from `master` to `main`.
This only represents one small part of the (publicly archived) conversation, but there is more behind-the-scenes work that involves talking to other members of the Fedora community.
Another example is https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/335[Fedora-Council#335], which was a proposal for the link:{FWIKI}/Objectives/CommunityOutreachRevamp[Fedora Community Outreach Revamp].
While not explicitly a diversity, equity, and inclusion topic, there is an opportunity for the DEI Advisor to share constructive feedback to up-and-coming xref:project::initiatives.adoc[Community Initiatives].

[[responsibilities-team]]
=== To Fedora DEI Team

* Participate in at least one DEI Team meeting (out of two) each month.
** If the DEI Advisor cannot make one meeting, they will provide updates asynchronously to the team or the Meeting Chair.
* Share periodic updates and insight on Fedora Council tasks and priorities back to the DEI teams.
* Maintain and update DEI team documentation for any key objectives and the DEI Advisor role page.

[[responsibilities-team-examples]]
==== Examples

* *DEI Team meetings*:
https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/diversity-team/[Held on Matrix and audio/video twice monthly].
Also an opportunity for the DEI Advisor to share any announcements or on-going work in the Fedora Council back with the wider team.
* *Documentation*:
Help keep pages (like this one!) up-to-date in the DEI Team documentation.
* *Budget maintenance*:
This is done with support from the xref:council::fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect].
Logistics of how this is updated varies between DEI Advisors.

[[responsibilities-community]]
=== To Fedora community

* Listen to needs, concerns, and hopes of the Fedora community for Fedora.
* Be an intersectional advocate for the diverse Fedora community to Fedora leadership.
* Act as a source of support and/or mediator in concerns or incidents.
* Make explicit invitations to Fedora community events and provide financial support to do so when needed.
* Promote inclusion in the Fedora community.

[[responsibilities-community-examples]]
==== Examples

There are fewer concrete examples of these responsibilities to the Fedora community.
Each DEI Advisor takes their own approach to these responsibilities.
It is also an opportunity for the DEI Advisor to take a creative spin on the role.
There is always room for new ideas and approaches on how to best serve the needs of the Fedora community and encourage inclusion across Fedora.


[[selection]]
== Selection

This section explains how the DEI Advisor is nominated and confirmed.
The selection process documented below is initiated when a rotation of Advisors is motioned by the existing DEI Advisor, the Fedora DEI Team, or the Fedora Council.

[[selection-nomination]]
=== Nomination

There will be a one-week nomination period for a potential DEI Advisor.
Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated by others with their consent.
A prospective nominee should understand the dynamics of the Fedora DEI Team, a basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects, and have sufficient time to perform the responsibilities required.
Nominees are required to be members of the Fedora DEI Team.

In the event that there are no nominees, the DEI Team will work with the Council to broaden the search message and request more time.
Should no nominees be found after that, the role will rotate among existing DEI Team members until the next DEI Advisor is identified.

[[selection-confirmation]]
=== Confirmation

After the one-week nomination period expires, the Fedora DEI Team will discuss candidates in a public meeting.
In a meeting discussion, it provides an opportunity for the team to weigh in and share other context.
In the event that more than two nominees are both interested in the Advisor role, the Fedora DEI Team will coordinate with the xref:council::fpgm.adoc[Fedora Program Manager] to run an election.

For the Fedora Elections application, use these conditions:

* Nominee must be a member of `fedora-diversity` FAS group
* Voting is open to FPCA+1 voters (like Council elections)

The selected person and the Council will be notified once the selection is confirmed.
The selected person will begin serving as the DEI Advisor to the Council as soon as possible.

[[appendix]]
== Appendix

[[hackfest]]
Hackfest::
A hackfest is a multi-day "team sprint" where Fedora contributors gather together to work towards one or two clear objectives or goals.
Pre-COVID, teams could propose their own budgets for arranging travel, booking accommodations and a venue, and other support costs for bringing people together.
* Event Checklist
= Fedora Event Guidelines

This guide is intended as a resource for organizers of conferences and events from the Fedora community to support and encourage diversity and inclusion at Fedora events.

It has been produced by the Fedora Diversity & Inclusion team and has been adapted from the http://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org[NumFOCUS Discover Cookbook].

*Note*: Anyone in the Fedora community can be an organizer or help in organizing an event!

[[How-to-use-this-guide]]
== How to use this guide

You do not have to implement every suggestion in the guide in order to "qualify" as having a diverse and inclusive event!

This guide is intended to help event organizers to understand the *landscape* of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

*We encourage you to do as much as you can manage*. Implementing a few well-supported suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

We have highlighted suggestions *that are easy to implement* and which have a strong positive impact i.e. *"High Impact, Low Effort"*. These are *"low-hanging fruits"* and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.

We also encourage you to do *at least one thing* with "*High Impact, High Effort*". These are marked with a green checkmark ✅

*As a general rule, we encourage conference organizers to implement all of the 🍎 measures and at least one of the ✅ suggestions.*
= Fedora Event Inclusivity Checklist

[[organizing-committee]]
== Organizing committee

=== ✅ High effort, high impact

[%interactive]
* [ ] The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to create in your conference.

[[venue]]
== Venue

=== 🍎 Low effort, high impact

[%interactive]
* [ ] Seats reserved for wheelchair users and other mobility-impaired people

* [ ] Tick box at registration where every participant confirms that they have read the CoC
* [ ] Copy of CoC included in sponsor packet
* [ ] CoC easily accessible on conference website
* [ ] Short version included in the printed schedule as reminder
* [ ] Mentions in welcome talks and at start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem

[[participant-speaker-selection]]
== Participant and Speaker Selection
=== 🍎 Low effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Consider specific wording of how talks were solicited so as not to put people with diverse backgrounds off (e.g. call for “speakers who have advice or expertise to share” rather than “experts in best practices)
* [ ] Call for Proposals: Are you transparent that you want a broad and diverse group to share expertise?
What are the criteria that will be used to assess their submissions?
How and why are you trying to shake things up regarding diversity and inclusion compared to previous conferences?
* [ ] Attracting attendees: Considered what kind of photos you use to advertise your event and what kind of message that sends about diversity and inclusion

=== ✅ High effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Invited Speakers: Reached beyond the conference organizers’ own network and the circle of usual suspects to solicit speakers
* [ ] Review of submitted proposals: There is no 100% guaranteed way to avoid bias, but have you done everything you can to mitigate bias in the review process (e.g. by choosing double-blind review)?

[[event-registration]]
== Event Registration
=== 🍎 Low effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Can registrants request additional accessibility support?
* [ ] Can registrants specify dietary restrictions, in particular severe allergies?
* [ ] Can registrants opt out of having their photos taken at the event?
* [ ] Is there a check-box for registrants to indicate that they have read the Code of Conduct?

=== ✅ High effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Demographic information is better collected during a post-conference survey, but if you do collect demographic info: are you thoughtful in what you ask and how so as not to alienate people?
* [ ] Sufficient measures for anonymity and data security in place

[[check-in]]
== Check-in

=== 🍎 Low effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] System for photography opt-outs in place (e.g. by adding sticker or lanyard to conference badge)
* [ ] Pronoun pins (he/him, she/her, they/them), buttons or ribbons in place (optimally colour-coded)

[[grants-scholarships]]
== Grants/Scholarships

=== ✅ High effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Offering grants to support attendance of traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in technology and/or open source communities persons (including those who identify as LGBTQ, indigenous, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities) who otherwise wouldn’t have the means to participate

[[post-event-assessment]]
== Post-Event Assessment
=== ✅ High effort, high impact
[%interactive]
* [ ] Post-event survey of participants to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect
= Minimal Measures

*As a general rule, we encourage conference organizers to implement all the 🍎 measures and at least one of the ✅ suggestions.*

Making your conference inclusive and encouraging diversity is achievable.
The measures below are explained in more depth in the other pages of this Cookbook.

[[what-are-the-easiest-and-most-impactful-measures]]
== What are the easiest and most impactful measures?
Just follow the measures below. They are explained in more depth in the other pages of this Cookbook.
Measures that are *easy to implement* and have a *strong positive impact* are “*low-hanging fruit*” and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.
Measures that take more effort but have considerable impact are marked with a green checkmark: ✅.

[[organizing-committee]]
== Organizing Committee
✅ The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to create in your conference!
Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

Conference chairs and lead organizers should take special care to recruit an organizing committee that reflects the diversity of the event you aspire to create.

[[venue-selection-on-site-services]]
== Venue Selection & On-Site Services
=== Accessibility Considerations
* Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability

=== Mobility

* 🍎 Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily accessible seats, such as at the end of a row on the aisle.
* 🍎 Create wide aisles between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.

=== Disability
* 🍎 Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps. Ask conference organizers to announce important information over the microphone, which helps people with impaired vision.
* ✅ Book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees.

[[bathrooms]]
== Bathrooms
=== Gender-Neutral Bathrooms
* 🍎 Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the “wrong” restroom
** “If you think someone’s gender doesn’t match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don’t worry about it, they know better than you.” (via @LGBTplusBristol)
* ✅ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.

=== 🍎 Dedicated rooms
* Dedicated rooms (e.g., those below) should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory and maps.
* Don’t allow anyone (even organizers) to use dedicated rooms for other purposes.

=== 🍎 Quiet Room
* A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference. It’s intended for quiet decompression — no phone calls, talking/socializing, notification beeps!
* People whose religions require frequent prayer may also need a dedicated space.
If possible, provide a separate, nearby room that allows for quiet personal prayer without disrupting others.
If space is limited, work with the venue to offer a flexible-use room or provide access upon request.
* If a separate room is not possible, consider “quiet areas” with soft seating, low lighting, and clear signage.

[[catering]]
== Catering
Making sure that your attendees have something they can eat at mealtimes is an important element of building an inclusive and welcoming conference.

* It’s best to have a sign/small label in front of each dish with a list of ingredients and common labels (e.g. “gluten-free, vegan, includes peanuts”).
** 🍎 Ask your caterer to create and provide the labels.
* 🍎 Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated.
* ✅ Common dietary needs to plan for gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, pork-free, shellfish-free, soy-free, kosher, halal, and nut-free. Shellfish and peanut especially are usually a serious allergy so take extra care.

[[code-of-conduct]]
== Code of Conduct (CoC)
=== Awareness
Make sure that everyone involved in your conference/event is aware that the CoC applies to them: that it not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members, etc.

* 🍎 Provide a tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has read the CoC
* 🍎 Include a copy of the CoC in the sponsor packet
* 🍎 Mention that the CoC applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
* 🍎 Ensure that CoC is easily accessible on the conference website
* 🍎 Include a short version of the CoC on the printed schedule as a reminder
* 🍎 Mention the CoC in the welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem/violation

[[participant-and-speaker-selection]]
== Participant and Speaker Selection
=== Speakers
* 🍎 Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks, e.g., call for “Speakers who have advice or expertise to share” rather than “experts in best practices”
=== Invited Speakers
* ✅ Reach beyond the conference organizers’ own networks.
Take steps to go out and find people who might be lesser-known but would make great speakers.
Look for more than just “the usual suspects” and reach out to your wider network for ideas, suggestions, and introductions.

=== Selecting Speakers
* 🍎 Call For Proposals instructions – be clear who you want
** In the solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad & diverse group to share their expertise.
** Let applicants know what criteria will be used to assess their submission and how speakers will be chosen.
** If your conference has a long history, and you’re trying to change what the program make-up, be up front about the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how this may look different from years past.

=== Call for Proposals Review
* ✅ There are many approaches to reviewing and selecting conference contributions, and there is no foolproof type of review that always avoids biases.
Regardless of which approach you choose, open or anonymized, we encourage you to make it “double” so that both parties know each other (double-open) or neither party knows the other (double-closed)

=== Attracting Attendees
* 🍎 Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event - what do people look like who attend?

[[event-registration]]
== Event Registration
What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

=== Preparing to meet accessibility needs
* 🍎 Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
** “Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g., accessibility considerations). Please [email - add email here] and include the details of your request.”

=== Dietary Restrictions
* 🍎 Ask for dietary restrictions on the registration form. Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.

=== Photo Policy
* 🍎 If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out in the registration form.

=== Code of Conduct
* 🍎 Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a have a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

[[inclusive-practices-during-check-in]]
== Inclusive Practices During Check-In
=== 🍎 Photography Permissions
* Managing photography opt-outs:
** You can use badge lanyards at registration to indicate photo preferences (e.g., green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos)
=== 🍎 Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons
* Indicating pronouns:
** Select a label (pin/button/ribbon/sticker) for your lanyard/badge to communicate your pronouns. Using one even if you don’t feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
** Color-coordinate the labels by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see them. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color).

[[grants-scholarships]]
== Grants/Scholarships
✅ Offer grants to support attendance

* Eligibility Requirements
** Applicants should be from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to persons identifying as LGBTQ, indigenous, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities
** and be unable to attend without some financial assistance  <<ref1,[1]>>.

* Payment
** Typically, recipients either submit receipts for reimbursement, have direct expenses paid for by the organizing committee, or are granted a lump sum up-front.
** We encourage conferences to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for people who want to use it.
** Waiting for reimbursement can be a financial burden on scholarship recipients.

[[assessment-of-the-event]]
== Assessment of the event
✅ Survey participants after the event to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual participants.
You can consider specifically asking about inclusion/diversity on the survey.

See press release: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-linux-foundation-and-open-api-initiative-announce-agenda-for-apistrat-the-api-strategy-practice-conference[Linux Foundation Press Release.]
= Organizing Committee

*Note*: Anyone in the Fedora community who shows genuine interest in helping out is welcome to organize (be a part of the committee)

The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to create in your conference! Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

✅ Conference chairs and lead organizers should take special care to recruit an organizing committee that reflects the diversity of the event you aspire to create.If this feels challenging, consider reaching out to the Fedora DEI team for support, resources, or a short workshop to help you get started.

* Look for balance along many dimensions: seniority, topical expertise, geography, academia/industry, gender/racial/ethnic balance, disability status, academic lineage and many more.
* Ensure a good mix of long-term expertise and institutional memory with a flow of new people.
* Avoid cronyism: Use algorithmic and term-limited approaches to constitute the steering committee.

When creating the organizing committee, be aware of the specific roles assigned to individuals.
Avoid a situation in which the “housekeeping” roles are all assigned to women or other individuals from underrepresented groups.
The goal is to achieve diversity across many roles, including those of high technical prestige.

* Consider having a member of the organizing committee specifically responsible for mitigating/preventing bias and weaving inclusivity throughout the conference (e.g. “diversity chair” or co-chairs).
* “We tried, but they turned us down.” For both the organizing committee and also the program committee be ready with “spare” names.
Since there are relatively fewer women and underrepresented minorities in the community, they are often asked to do disproportionate amounts of service, and thus are frequently forced to say no at a higher rate.

= Venue Selection & On-Site Services

[[accessibility-considerations]]
== Accessibility Considerations

* Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability

[[mobility]]
== Mobility

* 🍎 Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily accessible seats, such as at the end of a row on the aisle.
* 🍎 Create wide aisles (2.5 m, so two power chairs can pass each other) between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.
* Reduce conference sprawl to support access for people who are mobility-impaired.
* Consider marking and enforcing “No Standing Zones” through rooms such as foyers that are both gathering areas and regions people must pass through. (A 2.5 m “corridor” marked on the ground in yellow tape is ideal.)
* Consider making remote access available via livestream, recorded talks, etc.
* Make sure the building is wheelchair accessible. (In the U.S. this is typically required by law.)
* Be aware of how far/near the closest wheelchair-accessible restrooms are. Attempt to shorten this distance when possible, and be sure all staff know where to direct attendees who require a wheelchair-accessible restroom.

[[create-access-visual-hearing-disabilities]]
== Create Access Visual & Hearing Disabilities
* ✅ Book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees.
** If the budget does not allow for both sign-language interpreters and captioning, we suggest that you opt for captioning, as it tends to create more access for a higher number of people. (See “Further Reading” below.)
* Select a venue that has a hearing loop, or audio induction loop (a special type of sound system for use by people with hearing aids) and make sure it is used

[[signage]]
== Signage
* Consider using patterns rather than just color on signs and presentation slides to indicate differences, to make comprehension easier for attendees with color blindness/low vision issues.
* Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps.
* Send maps to attendees in advance, with the event schedule.
* Provide large-print copies of printed materials, such as program booklets, via printing normally A5 documents on A4, or folded A4-booklets on A3.

[[microphones]]
== Microphones
* 🍎 Ask conference organizers to announce important information over the microphone, which helps people with impaired vision.
* Make sure that hand-held microphones are available
* Encourage session chairs to repeat questions from the audience over the mic so everyone can hear
* Session chairs should ensure that the microphone is used (even if the speaker thinks their voice is loud enough)

[[bathrooms]]
== Bathrooms
=== Gender-Neutral Bathrooms
* Ideally you would provide 3 types of restrooms: gender-neutral, female, male.
* ✅ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.
* How to re-label bathrooms:
** 🍎 List the specific amenities and what type of restroom it is. For example:
** “All Gender Restroom: Facilities available in this restroom include individual stall toilets, an accessible stall toilet, urinals, sinks, and a changing table” For detailed guidelines and examples of inclusive restroom signage, refer to https://pridefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/All-Gender-Restrooms.pdf[Best Practices for All-Gender Restroom Signage.]
** Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the “wrong” restroom
For example: “If you think someone’s gender doesn’t match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don’t worry about it, they know better than you.” (via https://twitter.com/lgbtplusbristol[@LGBTplusBristol])

* 🍎 Provide tampons and pads in all restrooms (some people who identify as male have periods and may need them)
* Consider using fragrance-free hand wash and reducing the use of air fresheners to help those with chemical sensitivities.

*Further Reading*:

* https://queerlyrepresent.me/resources/articles/event-accessibility[Queerly Represent Me: Planning an Inclusive Event]

[[dedicated-rooms]]
== 🍎 Dedicated rooms
* The rooms should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory and maps.
* Don’t allow anyone (even organizers) to use the room for other purposes.

[[nursing-pumping-room]]
== 🍎 Nursing & Pumping Room
* Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with a locking door.
* For the room to be optimally useful, these things are desired:
** Locking door
** Comfortable chair (ideally, with arms that do not have gaps between the armrest and the seat, and a set of firm cushions for positioning an infant)
** A desk or table next to the chair (to set the pump, bottles, etc. on), no more than 4 feet from the nearest electrical outlet
** Cleaning wipes, paper towels, and a garbage can for maintaining cleanliness
** Masking tape and a marker for labeling milk bottles and pump parts
** Proximity to a sink for handwashing and washing of pump parts
** A refrigerator for storage of pumped milk (could be in the pumping room, or ideally accessible outside the room but nearby)
** If possible, a dimmable light or a small lamp could be provided instead of bright overhead lighting

=== 🍎 Gender-Neutral Bottle Feeding Room
* Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender and also benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding.
* This should be a separate, additional room (NOT the same as the nursing and pumping room). It could accommodate multiple babies at a time and be equipped with:
** Multiple comfortable chairs with broad armrests to facilitate bottle feeding positions
** A bottle warmer
** Paper towels, cleaning wipes and garbage can for cleanliness
** Dim lighting and in a quiet area of the conference center/venue
** Clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, though a locking door is not necessary

[[quiet-room]]
== 🍎 Quiet Room
* A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference.
** No phone calls, talking/socializing, etc.
** Put notifications on silent/vibrate.
* Ideal is to provide one well lit quiet room, and a second dimly lit room.
* Consider “quiet areas” if a separate room is not possible.
= Catering
Many Fedora events don’t provide full catering, but it’s still important to help attendees find safe, accessible food options.

*🍎 If you are not providing catering:*

* Share a list of nearby restaurants, cafes, or grocery stores, including the types of food they serve and any dietary accommodations (e.g., vegan-friendly, halal, gluten-free).
* Include details like hours, distance from the venue, and whether reservations are recommended.

*🍎 If you plan to provide any snacks or meals on-site:*

* Label each dish clearly with ingredients and common dietary tags (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, contains peanuts).
* Offer a variety of beverages, especially non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated options.
* Be aware of common dietary needs: Gluten free, Dairy free, Vegan and vegetarian, Pork free, Shellfish free, Soy free, Nut free (especially peanuts—take extra care), Kosher, Halal
*Tip:* Even if you only offer light snacks, clear labeling and variety go a long way in making everyone feel included.

*Further reading*:

* https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/inclusive-event-catering/[Inclusive event catering]
= Code of Conduct (CoC)
* 🍎 Articulate a Code of Conduct for your event
* Get inspired by Codes of Conduct that have been phrased for other conferences (see also “Further Reading”)

[[goals]]
== Goals
A Code of Conduct should:

* Be easy to read (You shouldn’t need a law degree to understand it.)
* Be easy to find
* Explain how to report problematic or unethical behavior
* Explain the consequences of violating Code of Conduct provisions
* Include timelines/deadlines for enforcement action that will be taken

Additional ways to support and implement your Code of Conduct:

* Include FAQs
* Encourage positive behavior (don’t just discourage negative behavior)
* Have a “quick” version and a “less quick” version (e.g. http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html[JSConf])

[[awareness]]
== Awareness

Make sure that everyone involved in your conference/event is aware that the Code of Conduct applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.

* 🍎 Tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has read the Code of Conduct
** A pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea.
** Provide a link to the full (“less quick”) version of the Code of Conduct, hosted on its own page.
* 🍎 Include a copy of the Code of Conduct in the sponsor packet
* 🍎 Mention that the Code of Conduct applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
* 🍎 Ensure that the Code of Conduct is easily accessible on the conference website
** Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
** Implement additional web-based highlights of the CoC via loading pages, pop-ups, screen savers, etc.
* 🍎 Include a short version of the Code of Conduct on the printed schedule as a reminder
* 🍎 Mention the Code of Conduct in the welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem/violation
* 🍎 Place Code of Conduct reminders on tables at lunch and also signs in rooms reminding people during the day
* 🍎 Create a large banner sign at key entrances on the Code of Conduct as a reminder.
* If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on “Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable”
* “Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about any matter of concern, no matter how small.”
* Include short blurbs about the Code of Conduct during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on websites, etc.
* Consider a visual “workflow” of Code of Conduct violation:
** Report -> Action -> Resolution
* Make it clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

[[reporting]]
== Reporting
* Ensure confidentiality of the person who is reporting the violation (and the alleged violator)
* Ensure that the data is stored securely with limited access
* Make sure that people are aware of reporting mechanisms:
** Face to face with staff (Who is the dedicated ombudsperson or -persons?)
** Dedicated email, e.g. to codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org
** Open an issue here on Pagure; https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue
* Consider how a report against an authority figure would be submitted — e.g. if the ombudsperson is the subject of a CoC violation report, who is the report submitted to? (A good reason to have more than one ombudsperson.)

[[enforcement]]
== Enforcement
* Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take an action on the violation
* Discuss in advance with the organizing committee what the specific process will be for recording and addressing a CoC violation
* When possible, have a third party review the violation report (Another good way to handle the challenge of potential reports against authority figures.)
* Ensure the person who made the CoC violation report is aware of how it is being handled and when it has been resolved.

= Grants/Scholarships

Why funding is important

Registration vs. Travel & Lodging

* Registration waiver scholarships can be highly effective in creating opportunities for underrepresented folks to attend your event.
** Most http://www.pydata.org/[PyData] Diversity Scholarship recipients indicated that receiving funding to cover registration was make-or-break for their ability to attend.
* However, registration waivers alone often aren’t enough.
** Sometimes http://www.pydata.org/[PyData] Diversity Scholarship recipients who didn’t have additional outside sources of funding for travel & lodging were unable to attend even though their registration was covered.
** Interest in https://galaxyproject.org/news/2017-03-gcc2017-fellowships/[Galaxy fellowships] went up when covering the first $n of travel costs was added, as well.

✅ Offer grants to support attendance

* Eligibility Requirements
** Applicants should be
*** from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, indigenous, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities
*** and be unable to attend without some financial assistance <<ref1,[1]>>.
** Also consider providing support for applicants from developing economies.
*** You might use the http://bit.ly/1nO82wD[World Bank definitions] of low and low-middle income.
** Your organizing committee should decide which career stages are eligible: Everyone? Just students and post-docs? Junior faculty/researchers? Unemployed?
* The legal issues of specifically funding underrepresented groups varies by country.
** https://galaxyproject.org/[Galaxy] deals with this by having a separate entity (the Galaxy Community Fund) offer sponsorships.
* Payment
** Supported participants are often required to cover various expenses up front, with the expectation of reimbursement from the sponsor. However, this can be difficult for many participants who may not have the financial resources to do so.
*** To mitigate this issue, sponsors should cover as many expenses as possible directly, including flights, hotels (and deposits), and other major costs.
*** For expenses that cannot be paid directly, sponsors can utilize systems like Ramp, which allow for the creation of virtual credit cards. These cards can be assigned to supported participants, ensuring that expenses are charged directly to the sponsor, eliminating the need for participants to pay out of pocket.
** Typically, recipients either submit receipts for reimbursement, have direct expenses paid for by the organizing committee, or are granted a lump sum up-front.
** We encourage conferences to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for people who want to use it.
*** Waiting for reimbursement can be a financial burden on scholarship recipients.

Where to seek funding

* How to attract funding for scholarships?
** Consider posting an opportunity for attendees or community members to make individual donations in support of travel scholarships.
** Make corporate sponsor levels specifically tied to travel+lodging and/or registration scholarships. (e.g. https://pydata.org/pdf/sponsor-prospectus.pdf[PyData offers Diversity Scholarships as sponsor benefits])
** Run a crowdfunding campaign to support particular inclusion efforts (e.g. childcare expenses — https://web.archive.org/web/20160527052000/http://opensourcebridge.org/blog/2016/05/childcare-and-scholarships/[Open Source Bridge did this].
** Dedicate surpluses from previous events to funding fellowships.

* Possible Funding Sources (needs more research)
** http://legacy.python.org/psf/grants/[Python Software Foundation]
** https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants[NumFOCUS Foundation]
*** Offers grants to organizing committees for diversity scholarships
** http://www.pyladies.com/[PyLadies]
*** Gives scholarships to PyCon participants

= Participant and Speaker Selection

[[speakers]]
== Speakers

[[invited-speakers]]
== Invited Speakers

* ✅ Reach beyond the conference organizers’ own networks.
Take steps to go out and find people who might be lesser-known but would make great speakers.
Look for more than just “the usual suspects” and reach out to your wider network for ideas, suggestions, and introductions.
* Identify a group of people to solicit as conference speakers
** Take extra steps to ensure a diverse speaker pool
*** Make the list of potential speakers who are underrepresented longer than the list of usual suspects (e.g. — have a longer list of women than men), so when someone declines or drops out you can just move to the next one on the list. Underrepresented folks are often overburdened with speaking requests, hence the need for a longer list.
** Keep and maintain a list of possible speakers with expertise and their contact info
** Research and follow speaker lists compiled by other organizations and communities
** When querying your network for speaker ideas, specifically ask for suggestions of speakers who could contribute to the diversity of the speaker line-up
** If your system is to have speakers come to you & ask, but research shows they tend not to do so, they won’t come.
* 🍎 Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks (subtlety can make a big difference)
** E.g. “Experts in best practices” may turn away people who don’t self-identify as “expert” or who have impostor syndrome.
** “Speakers who have advice or expertise to share” > Everyone has some level of expertise or knowledge to share about what they work on, so this phrasing is more inclusive and inviting.
* Ensure panels and roundtables include a diversity of participants
** Make strategic use of the moderator role to help support diverse participation

[[selecting-speakers]]
== Selecting Speakers

* 🍎 Call For Proposals (CFP) instructions
** In the solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad & diverse group to share their expertise.
** Let applicants know what criteria will be used to assess their submission and how speakers will be chosen.
** If possible, create detailed instructions and/or run workshops to help prepare people to write strong proposals.
** Be clear in who you want
*** If your conference has a long history and you’re trying to change what it’s like, be up front about the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how this may look different from years past.
** Consider carefully the way you describe your event and the call for proposals in order to avoid turning away or self-de-selecting of potential speakers.

* Offer speaker training
** Let potential speakers know there are resources to help them prepare, and provide them.
** Ask potential speakers to ensure the content of their talk abides by the code of conduct
** Consider color-blindness in slide design
** Provide handouts of slides and/or transcripts (both large and small format)
** Verbally describe graphs and illustrations

[[incentivize-first-time-speakers]]
== Incentivize First-Time Speakers:

* E.g. “We are looking to diversify our speaker panel; we want to select a cohort of first-time speakers to ensure we continue to offer professional development opportunities to everyone in the community.”

[[attracting-attendees]]
== Attracting Attendees

* Be clear about what your event is about, explain it to people who are less familiar and haven’t attended before.
* 🍎 Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event—what do people look like who attend?
* Partner with organizations whose membership you’d like to convince to attend your event.
* Offer scholarships for first-time and underrepresented attendees.
* Advertise the Code of Conduct to convey that you are seeking an inclusive environment.

[[call-for-proposals-review]]
== Call For Proposals review (“double-blind” vs “affirmative action”)

* “Open” versus “Blind” or “Closed” Review
** “Open” review is a form of review in which the names of the reviewers are made public.
** “Double-Open” review is when the reviewers know the identity of the proposal author and the proposal author also knows the identity of their reviewers
** “Double Blind” review means the reviewers do not know the identity of the proposal author and vice versa.
** “Single Blind” or simply “Blind” review means that the author of the proposal does not know the identity of the reviewers.
** Sometimes the term “Closed” or “Anonymized” is used instead of “Blind”.
* Double “Blind” Review
** By changing speaker selection to completely “blind,” you may be able to increase representation from traditionally underrepresented groups. (See “Further Reading” below.)
** You might create a CFP form that instructs the submitter to withhold identifying information.
** You can assign 1-2 people to remove the identifying information from submissions before passing them to the next group of reviewers/the assessing team.
*** However, be aware that it’s not always possible to do this, particularly if the work is tightly tied to the authors, or is based on their past work, and that reviewers can often determine authors even when they technically shouldn’t. Reviewers may also search for information about the subject of the work, which can lead them to a preprint of the submitted material with the authors listed. In this case, you may want to explicitly instruct the reviewers to try not to consider information about the authors they happen to know or find.
** If you recognize a submission author and you’re on the review committee, you should not grade the submission—recuse yourself from reviewing that submission. Of course, if the process is double-blind, you may not be aware that you have a conflict with it.
** Optionally, the review team can de-anonymize after the review process to ensure that the final selection is representative of the diverse grouping that is desired.

* Double Open Review
** Reviewers know who the proposal authors are and proposal authors know who the reviewers are.
** Some believe that open reviews are higher quality than anonymous reviewers, as the reviewers have to stand behind their comments.
** https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/chair-reviewer-guidelines[Sample guidelines for reviewers in double open review systems]

* ✅ Regardless of which approach you choose, open or anonymized, we encourage you to make it “double” so that both parties know each other (double-open) or neither party knows the other (double-closed)

= Event Registration
What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

[[preparing-to-meet-accessibility-needs]]
== Preparing to meet accessibility needs
* Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
* 🍎 Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
** “Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please contact the DEI team and let them know the details of your request.”
* Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

[[supporting-attendance-through-grants]]
== Supporting Attendance through Grants
* Ask about any grant or scholarship opportunities, e.g. for childcare, scholarships for underrepresented folks
** “Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare or on-site childcare services? (yes/no) Which option would be most beneficial for you?”

[[dietary-restrictions]]
== Dietary Restrictions
* 🍎 Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
* Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions. (Forcing registrants to choose from a pre-defined list might miss important allergies or restrictions.)
** “Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)”

[[photo-policy]]
== Photo Policy
* 🍎 If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
** (see lanyard/photography explanation under Inclusive Practices)

*Further reading*:

* http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Photography[Geek Feminism Photography]

[[code-of-conduct]]
== Code of Conduct
* 🍎 Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

[[t-shirts]]
== T-Shirts
If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.

* Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size.
(Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
* Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. “fitted” vs. “straight-cut”) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (“men’s,” “women’s,” “unisex”).

*Further reading*:

* http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/T-shirts[Geek Feminism T-Shirts]
* http://cczona.com/unisex-swag-shirts-are-harming-your-community/[Unisex Swag Shirts Are Harming Your Community]

[[demographic-info]]
== Demographic Info

* Why do you need it?
** We recommend you do not ask for information just “out of curiosity” but rather that there are planned actions you will take depending on the results of your demographic question(s).
** If you are asking just for the purpose of “counting” or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead, to protect participant privacy.
* If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, make it optional, not required. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt stereotype threat.
* ✅ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don’t contribute to alienating or “othering” marginalized people.
** Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
* ✅ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.
* Suggested format for demographic question:
** “Do you self-identify as an underrepresented minority in either the [conference] community or in your professional field?”
*** “Along which dimension(s) you self-identify as underrepresented? Check all that apply:”
**** Gender identity
**** Ethnicity, nationality, skin color, race
**** Sexual orientation
**** Socioeconomic status
**** Religion
**** Age
**** Ability
**** Do not wish to provide
**** Other (please specify)

= Inclusive practices during check-in

[[photography-permissions]]
== 🍎 Photography Permissions
* Managing photography opt-outs:
** Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos)

[[pronoun-pins-buttons-or-ribbons]]
== 🍎 Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons
* Indicating pronouns:
** Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don’t feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
** Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color).
*** Be sure to choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case, they’re more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
*** To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily seen. Make the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word “Pronouns”.
** Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
*** Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a “Fill in your own” ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers. (h/t @oxinabox)

[[welcoming-new-attendees]]
== Welcoming New Attendees
* Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. “First-Time Attendee.”
** Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
* Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

[[social-events]]
== Social Events
* “First-Time Attendee” lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
* Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
** Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
* Alcohol Considerations
** We recommend the https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/[AdaCamp Toolkit’s summary approach to alcohol at events]
= Assessment of the event

✅ Survey participants after the event to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.

See whether there is any correlation between being part of a minority group and how welcoming the conference felt to the individual participants.
You can consider specifically asking about diversity and inclusion on the survey.

[[practical-considerations]]
== Practical considerations
* Have a plan in place to analyze the data shortly after the event – this can be time-consuming and you will need lots of helping hands to clean data
* Make sure you review the survey outcomes after the meeting with your organizing committee
* Communicate any findings to the next organizing committee if the conference/event is part of a series

*Further Reading* Be sure to check out the Event Registration section on xref:event-checklist:event-registration.adoc#demographic-info[“Demographic Info”]  before undertaking any survey that asks participants for information on their identity.

Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team invites the community to give feedback and make suggestions for improvements to this guide via https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/docs/-/merge_requests[merge request (MR)]. MRs will be evaluated by the Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team and/or its volunteers.
MRs should be written so as to conform to the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/[Fedora Code of Conduct].

For a full statement of the Fedora Diversity and Inclusion Team mission and our work, please see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/

*IMPORTANT NOTE ON LEAVING FEEDBACK, PLEASE READ*: Thanks for your help in supporting the DEI Team to build these guidelines. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you proceed to give feedback.

* Everything mentioned here is a suggestion and none of the guidelines are compulsory for Fedora event organizers. For more information, please read the ‘How to use this guide’ section in the main page before you proceed to give feedback.
* These guidelines are written for all event organizers in Fedora eg. from local community events like release parties to global conferences like FLOCK.
* Your feedback will be extremely valuable to help us improve it and to build DEI in the Fedora community.

Here are some pointers to think about when leaving feedback on this document :

* What do you think of general rule for evaluation mentioned in ‘How to use this guide’ section i.e. “As a general rule, we encourage conference organizers to implement all of the 🍎 measures and at least one of the ✅ suggestions.”
** Is this feasible for smaller local community events like Release Parties?
** For global community conferences eg. FLOCK, should this rule be different? If so, what?

* Select a section of interest and think about the following for each of the suggested guidelines in that section:
** Is this relevant for the Fedora community? If no, why not and how can we make it more relevant?
** As an event organizer,
*** Is this guideline clearly understandable? If not, what is unclear?
*** What are the efforts (low, medium, high)  and impact (low, medium, high) needed to implement this guideline as an organizer of a local Fedora community event eg. Release Party?
**** For example, please identify “low effort- high impact” guidelines as 🍎and “high effort-high impact” guidelines as ✅
*** Do you need more resources to implement this guideline and/or support from Fedora DEI Team?

= Events

The Events section of the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Team Docs aims to build a Fedora Diversity events calendar and identify regional events for participation. Our focus is on supporting minority-specific events to promote a more inclusive environment across the Fedora Community, we target minority-specific events.

Our mission is to *embed inclusivity into all Fedora events* and to *expand Fedora’s reach into historically marginalized regions* through meaningful and well-supported participation.

== Making Fedora events inclusive

Inclusivity should be a part of all Fedora events and activities. Here are some best practices to consider when planning an event with your community:

* Design sessions that are hybrid or remote-friendly
* Include speakers, panelist and/or contributors from diverse backgrounds
* Share the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/[Code of Conduct] clearly before the event
* Provide translation or interpretation, if possible
* Choose accessible venues and platforms

== Hosting events in marginalized regions

We want to support Fedora events in regions where open source is still growing - such as parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and more. This requires thoughtful planning.

Here’s how to support that:

* Partner with local schools or tech communities
* Offer support for travel, internet access, or event costs (e.g., swag for contributors)
* Use local languages and culturally aware communication
* Connect local organizers with Fedora mentors

== Upcoming events

If you’re looking for upcoming events, you can check https://calendar.fedoraproject.org//Events/[Fedora events calendar] for a list of official community activities.

We would love to support you, and if you want to plan or have an upcoming event, or even want to help us with upcoming events, you can get in touch with the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/get-involved/[DEI team] or https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/roles/council-advisor/[Fedora DEI adviser].

= Social Events in Fedora

Fedora social events are fun, welcoming spaces where people can connect, share, and build community. They happen during bigger conferences like *Flock*, or as part of smaller events or local meetups.

These events are open to everyone - you don’t have to be an expert. The goal is to create a relaxed space where people can hang out, swap stories, play games, and enjoy being part of the Fedora community - they make Fedora feel more human and inclusive.

*Tip*: Focus on small, easy-to-join activities, give clear instructions, and always invite newcomers to jump in. It’s okay if things aren’t perfect - what really matters is people showing up and learning.

== Examples of Fedora DEI Social events

We’ve organized various activities in the past, below are some of the examples we’ve hosted at past Fedora gatherings:

= Fedora Week of Diversity

image:ROOT:fwd/fwd.png[Fedora Week of Diversity logo.]

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/events/past-events/#_fedora_week_of_diversity_fwd[Fedora Week of Diversity] highlights and celebrates the contributions of diverse contributors and communities across Fedora and the wider open source ecosystem.

Originally started as https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/events/past-events/#_fedora_womens_day_fwd[Fedora Women’s Day] to recognize and uplift women contributors, this event has evolved into Fedora Week of Diversity to better reflect our community’s commitment to inclusion across regions, cultures, and backgrounds.

Each year, Fedora contributors come together to share experiences, spotlight community achievements, and help more people discover how they can get involved in free and open source software. Fedora Week of Diversity is also an opportunity to strengthen regional communities, amplify underrepresented voices, and create a welcoming environment for everyone.

== How to participate

Fedora Week of Diversity is designed to be flexible and the focus for each year may change - past themes have included https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/fwd-2024/cfp[*Empowering Diversity, Enriching Communities* (2024)]. Because of this, how you participate can vary; for example, you might share a personal story or blog post, record an interview or podcast, or thank contributors publicly.

Note: Organizers will share themes and details each year. Watch the Fedora https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/[Community Blog], https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[Discourse], or https://matrix.to/#/#dei:fedoraproject.org[DEI team Matrix channel] to stay updated.

== How to organize Fedora events

Organizing FWD takes effort and in this section, we’re going to lay down the foundations of how to organize one. Anyone can help organize a local or virtual event organized by the DEI team. This guide shows you how you can get started and run a smooth, inclusive event.

== Pre-Planning (3-6 months before)

Before anything else:

* Decide on event format (virtual / local / hybrid)
* Brainstorm a theme or focus (e.g. "Stories from the Community", "First Contribution Day", “open Source journeys”, “Fedora Around the World”)
* Create https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/dei/-/issues[a Fedora DEI GitLab ticket]. Use this to request support for the FWD activities.
* For funding support, follow the process outlined by the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/[Fedora Mindshare Committee]. Budget requests should go through them. Be sure to plan early and clearly explain what you need.
* Think about what you’ll need: speakers, hosts, swags, venue or platform?

=== Coordinate with the Fedora DEI Team

Then these steps below are mandatory and important to follow in that order:

* *Open a ticket* in the https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/issues[Fedora DEI GitLab repository].
* *Discuss your ticket* during the *Fedora DEI bi-weekly meeting* to get feedback, guidance, and alignment.
* *Stay connected via Matrix* for follow-up questions, coordination, and real-time updates.

(For any event that requires funding, swag, or promotion help - the DEI GitLab ticket is the first and most important step.)

== Recommended timeline

It is easier to manage your event when you have a clear timeline beforehand. Below is a recommended timeline to help you stay on track from concept to post-event wrap-up.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Timeline
| Task

| 5–6 months before
| Propose event via https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/issues[GitLab DEI ticket]

| 4 months before
| Confirm date, format, venue(if in-person) speakers & visuals

| 3 months before
| Request support (promotion, mentorship, or budget) via your GitLab ticket

| 2 months before
| Launch call for participation (optional) +
(Invite community members to participate)

| 1 month before
| Promote your event on social media and Fedora channels

| 1 week before
| Send/post final reminders, do a tech check or dry run

| Event day
| Run the event! 🎉

| 1–3 days after
| Share blog recap + community highlights
|===

== Promote your event

Make it easy for people to find and join your event:

* Use hashtags like *#FWD(year, eg. FWD2025)* or one relevant to your event.
* *Add a picture or poster* if you have one. Make sure it’s easy to read and not too crowded. In case you don’t have a designer in the team - reach out to the design team to create one for you.
* *Tag relevant Fedora accounts* and other people or groups who might be interested.
* *Write clearly* – tell people what the event is, when it is, who should come, and what they’ll learn.
* *Post in multiple places* : Fedora Discourse, Matrix, X(twitter), Instagram, Mastodon, and in local communities.
* *Post more than once* – share early, remind people a few days before, and post during or after the event too.
* *Coordinate with the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/marketing/need-help/[Fedora Marketing Team]* early, as they’re really helpful in supporting and amplifying your event.

== Contributor roles

It is good to divide and assign tasks, meaning clear roles make sure everyone knows what to do - and it gives new contributors a chance to step up.

Typical roles include: Project management, Event production, Speaker management, Content and promotion and Design. Check the https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/week-of-diversity/-/blob/main/README.md[Week of Diversity GitLab README] for more.

You don’t need a huge team - a few people can make it happen.

(These roles are adopted from Fedora Week of Diversity(FWD), which has successfully used this structure to organize FWD events.)

== Post-Event Wrap-up

You did it! Now it's time to document your impact and celebrate your team.

* Thank speakers, organizing team and attendees
* Share a short blog post or Discourse recap (with photos or quotes), check https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/recap-of-fedora-week-of-diversity-2024/124450[FWD2024 recap].
* Submit your GitLab wrap-up note with:
** What worked
** What could be improved
** Participant feedback (if any)

This will help us all learn and grow - and it makes your event part of Fedora’s living history.

You can read the full recap here: https://fedoramagazine.org/were-in-kenya-fedora-at-muranga-university/[Fedora Magazine blog post], and the https://mut-fedora-event.vercel.app/[highlights here].

== Build pathways for the community: Beyond events

To truly support contributors from marginalized regions, DEI events must connect attendees to long-term opportunities and the possible ways we can retain them:

* Industry connections and job pipelines
* Global-local mentorships
* Training and skill-building follow-ups
* Fedora swag and material support
* Inclusion in Fedora working groups and decision spaces

This page is maintained by the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Team. If you’d like to suggest changes or add your event, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/get-involved/[contact the team] or https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/dei/roles/council-advisor/[the DEI Adviser].

= FWD organizer resource pack

In this page you can find a resource pack that helps in organizing a successful xref:events:about-fwd.adoc[Fedora Week of Diversity] event. The points below can be used in the event organizer's agenda:

* How to welcome contributors to Fedora
* A summary about Fedora D.E.I. team
* Overview of different Fedora editions
* Fedora and Python

== How to welcome new contributors to Fedora?

Did you come across folks who are interested in contributing to the Fedora project? Then please create link:https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issues[Welcome to Fedora ticket] for the newcomers with Fedora Join SIG.  This ticket helps them to easily track their progress in the journey to becoming Fedora contributors.
Find more information about the welcome ticket process link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/welcome/welcome/[here].

Need help with creating the welcome ticket? Reach out to Fedora Join SIG at any of their https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-join/#communication[Communication channels].

== About Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team

At your event, start with an introduction to the Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team.
Explain the role of D.E.I. team in the Fedora community and its upcoming goals.
Share our xref:ROOT:index.adoc[team's introduction page] with anyone who is interested in learning more.

What is the role of Fedora Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Team?::
As the name indicates, the main goal of the D.E.I. team is to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in Fedora community.
Below are some of the many efforts focused by D.E.I. team to achieve its goal:
* Creating content and organizing events to spread awareness about diversity within and outside Fedora community (like Fedora Week of Diversity!)
* Supporting community building and engagement activities to promote inclusion
* Coordinate with Fedora sub-projects to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the community
* Supporting programs committed to building diversity, equity, and inclusion in Free and Open Source Software communities

What the D.E.I. team works on?::
The D.E.I. team works on various tasks to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Fedora Project.
For example, new additions were made to the 2018 https://flocktofedora.org/[Fedora Flock conference] such as including gender-neutral bathrooms, a quiet room, and communication preference stickers.
These additions in turn supported our existing effort to draft https://pagure.io/fedora-diversity/issue/54[event inclusion guidelines] for Fedora event organizers.
These guidelines when shared within and outside Fedora community provide best practices to organizers holding an event.
In the past, we also worked on a xref:survey:index.adoc[Fedora Project Demographic Survey] to understand who is in the Fedora Community.

Community Script::
Hi, my name is \_____, I am from \_____, I am \_____, and I speak \_____.
We are from different countries, We speak different languages, We are of different cultures, But Fedora unites us with Open Source. WE ARE FEDORA!

== Fedora Editions

{FWIKI}/Editions[Fedora Editions] are the flagship configurations of Fedora offered by the Fedora Project.
They are promoted on the https://getfedora.org/[getfedora.org] website.
Each Edition has a different use case and audience as explained below.

=== Fedora Workstation

https://getfedora.org/workstation/[Fedora Workstation] is a primary desktop configuration offered by Fedora.
Fedora workstation is a great choice for someone looking to use a Linux on their desktop or learn to develop in a Linux environment.
It ships the https://www.gnome.org/[GNOME Desktop Environment], includes latest versions of programming languages and libraries, and is easy to make a https://fedoramagazine.org/make-fedora-usb-stick/[bootable USB stick].

* For a comprehensive description of updates and new features, see the official release notes link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/[here].

=== Fedora Server

https://getfedora.org/server/[Fedora Server] is a primary server configuration offered by Fedora.
This makes a good choice for seasoned system administrators, allowing them to work with latest technologies from the open source community.
This is a short-lifecycled, community-supported server environment.
Fedora Server features https://cockpit-project.org/[Cockpit], https://www.freeipa.org/page/About[FreeIPA identity management], and the brand-new https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/[Fedora Server Modular Edition].

See recent features to Fedora Server link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/sysadmin/[here].

=== Fedora Silverblue

https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Silverblue] is a variant of Fedora Workstation.
It looks, feels and behaves like a regular desktop operating system giving an experience is similar to a standard Fedora Workstation.

However, unlike other operating systems, Silverblue is immutable.
This means that every installation is identical to every other installation of the same version.
The operating system that is on disk is exactly the same from one machine to the next, and it never changes as it is used.

=== Fedora CoreOS

https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/[Fedora CoreOS] is an automatically updating, minimal, monolithic, container-focused operating system designed for clusters but also operable standalone. This is optimized for Kubernetes but also works great without it.
It aims to combine the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and Fedora Atomic Host, by integrating Ignition technology from Container Linux with rpm-ostree and SELinux hardening from Project Atomic.
The goal of this edition is to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads securely and at scale.

=== Fedora IoT

xref:iot:ROOT:index.adoc[Fedora IoT] or Fedora Internet of Things provides a strong foundation for IoT ecosystems.
Whether you’re working on a project at home, industrial gateways, smart cities or analytics with AI/ML, Fedora IoT can provide a trusted open source platform to build on.
Fedora IoT rolling releases help you keep your ecosystem up-to-date.
