# What is Fedora? {#_what_is_fedora}

The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a
free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share
user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we
make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff
with it.

&lt;&lt;&lt;

# What is Fedora all about? {#_what_is_fedora_all_about}

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different
views and approaches, but together we share some common values. We call
these the "&#42;Four Foundations&#42;": Freedom, Friends, Features, and
First.

# Our Vision {#_our_vision}

> *The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from
> free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and
> open-minded communities.*

As a project, we want everyone to live in a universe of free and open
source software; the user should be in control of their computing. But
it's not enough that the software is there, waiting to be used. It has
to be accessible and usable. This vision also reflects our community
approach --- the Friends foundation. Fedora isn't bits and bytes. Fedora
is our people, and we want the statement to include our vision of a
healthy community.

# Our Mission {#_our_mission}

> *Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
> containers that enables software developers and community members to
> build tailored solutions for their users.*

At the operating system level, we don't just integrate. We do new things
--- we build a *platform*, not just a distribution. The *Features* and
*First* foundations drive us to innovate. We do all of this as a
transparent, collaborative community of *Friends*, and entirely as open
source and free software --- *Freedom*.

# Our Method {#_our_method}

The Fedora Project is a center for innovation in free and open source
software. In our community, contributors of all kinds come together to
advance the ecosystem for the benefit of everyone. The Fedora community
contributes everything it builds back to the free and open source world
and continues to make advances of significance to the broader community,
as evidenced by the regular and rapid incorporation of its features into
other Linux distributions. Regardless of which Linux distribution you
use, you are relying on code developed within the Fedora Project.

We believe software patents are harmful, a hindrance to innovation in
software development, and are inconsistent with the values of free and
open source software. While tightly integrating proprietary and patent
encumbered components might superficially improve ease of use, this
practice does not benefit the community in the long run. The Fedora
community prefers approaches that benefit the progress of free software
in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of use.

# Our Community {#_our_community}

Fedora is more than just software. It is a community of contributors
from [around the world](https://fedoracommunity.org/), including
volunteers and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance
the interests of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join.
No matter what your skills are, we have a place for you in our
community! We are [software engineers](package-maintainers::index.xml),
[designers and artists](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design), [system
administrators](infra::index.xml), [web designers](websites::index.xml),
[writers](fedora-docs::index.xml),
[speakers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors),
[translators](localization::index.xml), and more --- and we are happy to
help you get started.

We believe that all contributors should [be excellent to each
other](https://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct). By creating an
environment for constructive contribution, we can more effectively and
successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best
solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and
strength of our community.

# Leadership and Governance {#_leadership_and_governance}

The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is responsible for stewardship
of the Fedora Project as a whole and supports the health and growth of
the Fedora Community. As in any large project, there are many different
levels of responsibility, accountability, and decision-making. As a
general rule, we want people working on a Fedora
[subproject](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Subprojects) to make
meaningful decisions about their areas of interest and expertise. More
details are available on our page on [Fedora
Leadership](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Leadership).

# Upstream First: A Core Fedora Principle {#_upstream_first_a_core_fedora_principle}

The concept of \'upstream first\' is a fundamental principle within the
Fedora Project. It shapes our history, culture, and approach to
contributing to the open source ecosystem. Understanding this principle
is crucial for anyone looking to contribute to Fedora and the broader
Linux distribution ecosystem.

## Fedora's Commitment to Upstream First {#upstream-why}

Fedora, as a Linux distribution, plays a unique role as an *integrator*
of countless software components. While Fedora develops some of its own
software, its primary function is to package and deliver a cohesive
operating system experience built upon the work of numerous upstream
projects.

From its inception, Fedora has championed the principle of *upstream
first*. This isn't a policy or hard rule; it's a core value woven into
the fabric of the Fedora community. Fedora contributors believe that
changes and improvements to open source software should, whenever
possible, be shared back with the upstream projects. This ensures that
&#42;all&#42; users of that software, not just Fedora users, can
benefit. Ultimately, Fedora's final objective is the benefit of the
user, and Fedora contributors will do what they think is best for the
user, even if upstream disagrees.

Upstream first is also a pragmatic engineering principle. By
contributing changes upstream, Fedora reduces the long-term maintenance
burden of carrying downstream-specific patches. Maintaining external
patch sets can become increasingly difficult as upstream projects
evolve. Embracing upstream first helps ensure the sustainability of
Fedora and its contributions.

This approach has a ripple effect throughout the open source ecosystem.
Changes landed in Fedora often impact numerous downstream projects that
use Fedora as a foundation. Therefore, contributing to Fedora is a
highly effective way to influence and improve the broader open source
landscape, particularly within the RPM/Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

By prioritizing upstream contributions, Fedora aligns with its vision of
a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built
by inclusive and welcoming communities. This commitment extends to
&#42;all&#42; open source software, not just Fedora itself.

## Understanding Upstream and Downstream {#upstream-downstream}

In the world of open source, projects often have interconnected
relationships described as \'upstream\' and \'downstream.\' The
*upstream* project is the original source of the software---the
foundation upon which other projects are built. *Downstream* projects,
in turn, are those that utilize and often modify the upstream software.
Think of it like a river: the upstream is the source, and downstream
projects are further along the flow, receiving and potentially altering
the water.

This metaphor is essential for understanding how open source projects
depend on and interact with each other. Different development models
encourage varying types of upstream/downstream relationships.

### Open Communication with Upstream {#upstream-communication}

Fedora recognizes the importance of clear and open communication with
upstream projects. We believe in fostering strong relationships with
upstream developers and communities, and actively seek their input and
feedback.

Fedora is always open to hearing from upstream projects about how we can
improve our collaboration and integration processes. We understand that
Fedora's downstream usage can sometimes create challenges or friction
for upstream projects. We encourage upstream maintainers to reach out to
us if they encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement.

Our goal is to work together constructively to find solutions that
benefit both Fedora and the upstream projects we rely on. While we
cannot always accommodate every upstream request, we are committed to
listening, learning, and adapting our practices to minimize any negative
impact on upstream communities.

The philosophy of working upstream first doesn't end with just
development. It also encompasses a productive, positive, and respectful
relationship with our upstream projects. Our communities overlap and we
want to extend our Fedora values to their project as much as we would
within Fedora. To that end we always want to deal with challenges
between projects together and have clear lines of communication.

### When Downstream Changes Happen {#upstream-exceptions}

While Fedora prioritizes upstream contributions, there are situations
where downstream-specific changes are necessary. These exceptions are
not contradictions of the upstream-first principle, but rather
acknowledgements of the complex realities of software development and
distribution.

Reasons for downstream patches include:

&#42; &#42;Upstream Rejection&#42;: Sometimes, upstream maintainers may
reject a patch for various reasons, even if it's beneficial to Fedora.
Fedora may still need to carry that patch to address a specific issue or
requirement. &#42; &#42;Upstream Progress&#42;: Upstream projects may
move forward with new features or changes that require significant
adaptation in Fedora. Fedora may need to backport fixes or implement
temporary workarounds while the downstream adaptation is completed.
&#42; &#42;Distribution-Specific Needs&#42;: Fedora, and its downstream
distributions like EPEL, may have unique requirements or constraints
that necessitate downstream modifications. These needs might relate to
specific hardware support, security considerations, or integration with
other Fedora components. &#42; &#42;Non-Free Blobs&#42;: Fedora is
committed to promoting free and open source software and building
everything from source. Sometimes, upstream projects include non-free or
pre-built binary blobs that Fedora needs to patch out to adhere to its
principles. While Fedora may discuss potential fixes with upstream,
these patches might not always be accepted if there are no suitable
alternatives or if they remove functionality.

In these situations, Fedora strives to minimize the scope and duration
of downstream patches, and continues to work towards upstreaming changes
whenever feasible. Understanding the reasons for downstream changes is
essential for maintaining transparency and trust within the community.

## Examples in Action {#examples}

The principle of \'upstream first\' manifests in various ways. Here are
a couple of examples:

&#42; &#42;Packaging Improvements&#42;: A Fedora packager identifies a
bug or missing feature in a build toolchain. Instead of creating a
Fedora-specific patch, they submit a patch upstream to the toolchain's
maintainers. After review and discussion, the patch is merged upstream,
benefiting all users of the toolchain and eliminating the need for a
downstream Fedora patch. &#42; &#42;Community Script&#42;: A Fedora
contributor develops a script for analyzing package data. They share the
script publicly. Another contributor enhances the script with new
features and submits a pull request. The original contributor merges the
changes, making the improved script available to the entire community.
&#42; &#42;License Clarifications&#42;: A Fedora packager discovers
licensing issues with an open source project, such as unclear or
non-compliant licenses for included assets. Instead of simply excluding
the project from Fedora, they work with the upstream developers to
clarify or correct the licenses. This ensures that the project can be
included in Fedora and benefits the broader open source community by
promoting license compliance. &#42; &#42;Avoiding Bundled
Dependencies&#42;: A Fedora packager notices that an upstream project
bundles a specific version of a dependency. Instead of using the bundled
dependency, they repackage the project to use the system-wide version of
the dependency. This ensures consistency across Fedora packages, enables
rapid security patch deployment, and maintains compatibility between
interdependent packages. &#42; &#42;Early Testing and Bug
Reporting&#42;: Fedora often pioneers the integration of new software
versions and libraries. This early adoption allows Fedora contributors
to identify and report build or compatibility bugs upstream,
particularly in the Python ecosystem. These contributions benefit the
entire open source community by ensuring smoother transitions and
upgrades for everyone.

These examples illustrate how upstream first fosters collaboration,
shared ownership, and continuous improvement within the open source
ecosystem. We encourage you to think about how you can apply the
\'Upstream First\' principle in your Fedora contributions. Have a story
about an upstream contribution? Share it with the community!

# Fedora Leadership {#_fedora_leadership}

The Fedora Project is led by contributors from across the community.
Different functional areas of Fedora at times evolve, build, or
dismantle their own formal (or informal!) leadership over time. Because
Fedora is an open source project, we encourage new contributors to
identify problems, find solutions, and collaborate with other members to
achieve results. Our community recognizes and empowers able leaders from
among our peers.

The Fedora Project aims to have a thin layer of governance that enables
decision making without excessive drag.

The following are current examples of *leadership groups* in Fedora.

## Fedora Council {#_fedora_council}

![council badge](council-badge.png)

The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is the topmost governance and
leadership body in Fedora, and is made up of appointed and elected
members from across the Fedora community. Details about the Council such
as size, constitution, and succession planning are found in the [Fedora
Council Charter](council::index.xml).

The [Fedora Project
Leader](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fpl/) (or \'FPL\')
serves as the chair of the Council.

## Fedora Engineering Steering Committee {#_fedora_engineering_steering_committee}

The [Fedora Engineering Steering Committee](fesco::index.xml) (commonly
known as \'FESCo\') is a community-elected body empowered by the Council
to manage the technical features of the Fedora distribution and specific
implementations of policy in the Fedora Project. You can find further
information about FESCo, its members, and its policies on the [FESCo
section](fesco::index.xml).

## Fedora Mindshare Committee {#_fedora_mindshare_committee}

The [Mindshare Committee](mindshare-committee::index.xml) represents
leadership for user and contributor community growth and support.

## Other groups {#_other_groups}

The list above is not a complete list of every group of empowered
community members. Other groups steer specific parts of Fedora as well,
empowered and supported by the relevant teams. The list above shows the
three leadership groups that most often work on issues of policy or
practice affecting large portions of the Fedora Project.

Community members are always encouraged to get involved in leading
Fedora in ways that are important to them, while minimizing overhead and
governance project-wide.

### Working Groups {#_working_groups}

Fedora [Editions](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Editions) ---
currently, [Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Atomic_WG),
[Server](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Server), and
[Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation), --- and
sometimes Fedora Project Objectives are lead by *Working Groups*. These
groups are either independent subcommittees of FESCo, Mindshare, or the
Council. They have formal membership and decision-making processes, but
generally the membership is intended to include active contributors and
the decision-making power reflects that. A seat on the Working Group
itself is *not at all* required to participate meaningfully in the work
on Editions or Objectives.

### Subprojects {#_subprojects}

[Subprojects](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/subprojects.html)
are long-standing major areas of effort under the overall Fedora
umbrella. Each subproject has its own governance.

### Special Interest Groups {#_special_interest_groups}

[Special Interest
Groups](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/sigs.html),
or \'SIGs\', are much less formal. The process for [creating a
SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Creating_a_Fedora_SIG) has &#42;no
red tape&#42;. Different SIGs have different structures; some use
formalized voting and others don't. Some SIGs may eventually become
subprojects; for others, the lightweight framework is perfect.

# How is Fedora Organized? {#_how_is_fedora_organized}

![Fedora Organizational Chart](orgchart.png)

Fedora is a big project, with many moving parts and dozens of groups and
subgroups. This chart gives a general overview and a sense of how things
fit together. The [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is our overall
leadership and governance body. Most of the project is then roughly
organized under [FESCo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/)
(the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee) or the [Mindshare
Committee](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/).

[Engineering teams](engineering::index.xml) includes a list of technical
teams and initiatives, most of which operate under FESCo.

Since many groups are rather informal, don't take the chart as written
in stone. Also, if it is a little overwhelming, don't worry. Fedora is a
friendly project --- just pick an area you're interested in, introduce
yourself to the people involved, and get started. Or, if you don't know
where to start, see [how to get involved](join.xml).

# The Fedora Logo {#_the_fedora_logo}

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs,
including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth
tablecloths and banners, and other printed material.

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of
such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We
seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously
in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement
of free and open source software and content.

# The Dos and Donts of the Fedora Logo {#_the_dos_and_donts_of_the_fedora_logo}

Don't search for the logos on a search engine and use whatever you find
there. There are many unofficial variations on the Fedora logos that are
not authorized, are unofficial, and do not respect these guidelines.
Please do not use them or spread them further!

Here are some guidelines you should avoid if you would like to use some
of our logos:

# Colors {#_colors}

We keep a single color palette to keep our artwork consistent, whether
it is different Fedora materials, Fedora materials on screen, on the
web, or on printed materials. Past mistakes have included Fedora DVDs
coming out purple (true story!) so please pay attention to these colors,
and please always use CMYK colors for professionally-printed collateral
and objects such as printed banners, T-shirts, hats, and stickers.
Otherwise, your design may well come out purple instead of blue!

# Typography {#_typography}

We recommend the following complementary fonts to use along with the
logos. Both recommended fonts are openly licensed and freely
distributable.

We recommend using Open Sans as a body text / copy font. It comes in a
wide range of weights.

We recommend using Montserrat as a titling / headline font. Montserrat
is also used in the Fedora Editions logos.

# Characters {#_characters}

Most of these characters were created as part of the Fedora Characters
Revamp Project. These mascots can be used in different projects.

You will be introduced to Badger, Beefy, Panda and Colúr and their
history within the Fedora Community along with what part they belong to
as well.

## Panda {#_panda}

Panda is a happy go-lucky panda with glowing ears and a glowing nuclear
symbol on her stomach and was originally created as a helper. You were
able to find her on on the 404 and 500 pages and also was in the Fedora
Docs pointing out tips and tricks. Panda is female and is a general
mascot for the Fedora community. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake redesigned
the Panda during the Fedora Character Revamp Project.

## Badger {#_badger}

Badger is the Fedora Badges mascot and has been featured on a lot of
different badges throughout the years. Badger was fist inspired by a
popular early 2000's internet meme involving badgers and snakes. Badger
is non-binary. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake brought them to life by
creating a new style for the Badger to fit in to the Fedora style.

## Beefy {#_beefy}

Beefy is a general mascot for the Fedora Community. He was the release
name for Fedora 17 and has been a popular character even before Fedora
Linux! He became a meme between Linux users. Beefy is male and on his
belly, the mustard indicates progress. He was also a bootup screen for
Fedora in past years and as it was loading, the mustard on his belly
grew. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake revamped the style of Beefy and
created him in many poses. If you would like to know more about the
origins of the Beefy Miracle, please visit: <https://beefymiracle.org/>

## Colúr {#_colúr}

Colúr is our newest character that was created as a mascot for our Flock
events. In 2022, Jess Chitas created him to go along with the Flock
events and to also bring a new Fedora character to the table! He is
based on the Pink-Necked Green Pigeon and his name came from the Irish
meaning Pigeon but also sounds like the word \'Color\'.

However, if you need help working with the logo to make sure you are
following the guidelines or want to do something different with it,
please email <logo@fedoraproject.org> or log a ticket on the [Design
team's GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues)
and we would be delighted to help you!

# What are Community Initiatives? {#_what_are_community_initiatives}

Want to do something big? Have an idea that won't fit in a single
release cycle? Perhaps an improvement broader than the technical scope
covered by the Changes policy? Want to make sure the community is
aligned behind your goal, and that you have the resources and access you
need to make it happen? &#42;A Community Initiative may be the framework
for you!&#42;

Fedora Community Initiatives (formerly \'Objectives\') are projects
which do not fall neatly into the biannual Fedora Linux release cycle.
Typically they require longer to complete (e.g. 8-18 months) and are not
limited to engineering projects. Other key areas are administration;
documentations; outreach; motivation; communications; budgets and best
practice. Within the Project these are grouped under a heading of
[Mindshare](mindshare-committee::index.xml). The Council looks to
achieve a balance between engineering projects and those aligned with
Mindshare.

The primary role of the [Fedora Council](council::index.xml) is to
identify the short-, medium-, and long-term goals of the Fedora
community and to organize and enable the project to best achieve them.
Anyone can propose a Community Initiative to the Council. To be
accepted, it should align with Fedora's [mission
statement](project::index.adoc&#35;_our_mission) and long-term goals.

Each Community Initiative has a designated Community Initiative Lead.
This Lead sits on the Council for the duration of the Initiative and is
responsible for coordinating efforts to reach the Community Initiative's
goals, as well as evaluating and reporting on progress. The Initiative
Lead works regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that
progress is made.

## Proposing a Community Initiative {#proposing}

To propose a Community Initiative to the Council, the Lead should first
discuss on the [&#35;council tag on Fedora
Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/council). Next, if
well-received, file a
[ticket](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/). Of course, people
need to be ready to do the actual work required --- a Community
Initiative without passionate bottom-liners will not get far.

To succeed, Community Initiatives require a leadership team with
division of responsibility. For example separating roles of project
leadership, engineering, marketing and documentation, depending on the
size and scope of the Initiative. The Council can assist a proposer in
finding the right people to work on the project if required.

### Executive Sponsors {#proposing-sponsors}

Every Community Initiative must have an Executive Sponsor. This can be
any current member of the Council -- even, possibly, the Lead of another
Initiative. You should find a sponsor as part of community discussion
before filing a ticket. Once someone has agreed to the responsibility,
the proposal can move forward.

#### Role of the Executive Sponsor {#proposing-sponsors-role}

A Fedora Council member becomes an Executive Sponsor until completion of
the Community Initiative or for the duration of their Council term
(whichever comes first). The Executive Sponsor is responsible for
partnering with the Lead as a connection point to the Fedora Project at
a high-level. The Executive Sponsor represents a wider view of what the
Fedora Project is focused on, whether that is in terms of the Fedora
strategy or a specific area of interest (e.g. DEI, Engineering,
Mindshare). The Executive Sponsor is not responsible for doing the work
directly, but rather as an advocate for the initiative and can help by
unlocking resources, help unblock work, act as a consultant on Council
and Project perspectives and generally supporting the initiative to
allow the work to succeed.

An Executive Sponsor may find that they are no longer able to fill this
role for a Community Initiative, whether due to an expiring Council term
or that they do not have the capacity to continue. In this event, the
Executive Sponsor and the Lead must work together to identify another
Fedora Council member who can be the Executive Sponsor.

#### Relationship between Lead and Executive Sponsor {#proposing-sponsors-relationship}

How the Community Initiative Lead and the Executive Sponsor collaborate
is largely up to them. However, it is suggested that the Lead and
Sponsor have a regular meeting cadence (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) to
check in on progress and identify challenges. The Lead should provide
updates to the Executive Sponsor on the work, engagement with the
community, and requests for help in order to succeed. The Lead should
expect the Executive Sponsor to ask them questions, suggest other teams
or people to collaborate with, and give suggestions on how to acquire
the needed resources to succeed. Periodically, the Executive Sponsor
will ask the Lead to share progress or milestones back to the wider
Fedora Council.

## How are Community Initiatives Finalized? {#completing}

At the end of the expected duration of the Initiative (as specified at
the proposal / acceptance stage), the Council will assess the progress
of the Initiative. If all of the aims or the most significant of them
are achieved, the Initiative will be terminated. If the aims are nearly
complete and further work substantially increases the impact, it may be
allowed to continue for a further agreed period. After that, it will be
terminated. Initiatives will not be allowed to run indefinitely.

## Current 12-18 Month Community Initiatives {#current}

This section documents the current Initiatives the Council have
accepted:

### Git Forge Initiative 2025 {#forge}

Vision

:   To empower Fedora developers and the Fedora community with a
    streamlined workflow through a consolidated Git source control and
    issue tracking solution, powered by Forgejo on Fedora
    Infrastructure.

Mission

:   To consolidate Fedora's source code management, issue tracking, and
    project hosting onto a single Forgejo platform deployed on the
    Fedora OpenShift Cluster, replacing Bugzilla and sun-setting Pagure
    (src.fedoraproject.org and pagure.io), while offering a migration
    path for Fedora Project repositories currently hosted on external
    platforms.

Community Initiative Lead

:   Ryan Lerch ([\@ryanlerch]({url_wiki}/User:Ryanlerch))

Executive Sponsor

:   Aoife Moloney ([\@amoloney]({url_wiki}/User:Amoloney)), with Jef
    Spaleta ([\@jspaleta]({url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta)) filling in for
    Aoife's maternity leave

Timeframe

:   18 months

Community Initiative Details

:   See the [wiki
    page]({url_wiki}/Initiatives/Git_Forge_Initiative_2025).

## History

See [completed Community Initiatives]({url_wiki}/Objectives/Completed)
and [potential Community Initiatives]({url_wiki}/Objectives/Potential).

Historically, Community Initiatives were known as Objectives. This
transition was made in February 2023 following in-person discussion by
the Fedora Council in our 2023 Council hackfest in Frankfurt, Germany.
We agreed to convert \'Objectives\' into \'Community Initiatives\',
which the Council felt was easier to understand and communicate the
roles of these efforts in Fedora. There is no functional change to
Objectives; it is just a semantic change.

# Communication in Fedora {#_communication_in_fedora}

As referenced on the [Get Involved](join.xml) page below, Fedora is a
massive global organisation with many people with different skills
carrying out different roles. As you get involved you may need to find
assistance and the [Getting Help](help.xml) page can help you with that.
This current page goes into more detail around the various communication
channels within the Project.

## Primary Channels {#_primary_channels}

### Chat {#_chat}

We now use [Matrix/Element](https://chat.fedoraproject.org) as the
primary synchronous channel to speak to each other in real time.

You can find a list of the Fedora channels on Matrix
[here](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/&#35;/room/&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org).

### Fedora Discussion {#_fedora_discussion}

[Fedora Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none)
is the primary discussion forum where you will find all the latest news
&amp; announcements, as well as discussion about open source projects;
workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Fedora Editions.
See also under [Getting Help](help.xml).

### Ask Fedora {#_ask_fedora}

[Ask Fedora](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) sits
within Fedora Discussion and is the main community knowledge base and
support forum hosted by the Fedora Project. Ask Fedora is a good place
to go for support and troubleshooting help, as mentioned on the [Getting
Help](help.xml) page.

## Other Communication Channels {#_other_communication_channels}

As above, [Fedora
Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) is now
the primary platform for longer asynchronous discussions where
short-lived chats may not be enough. Some teams do still use mailing
lists though. The most significant mailing lists are:

&#42;
[announce](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[devel](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[devel-announce](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[test](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/)

For a catalog of all the mailing lists look at
[lists.fedoraproject.org](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/)

[Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org) is a great resource for
user-facing announcements and cool stories about usage, features,
etc&#8230;

[Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org) brings
you contributor-facing announcements and updates. Within the Community
Blog you'll also find [Friday's Fedora
Facts](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/).
These are weekly posts with status updates, schedule info, etc..

The Fedora Pagure source control repository allows posting of
[issues](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/issues) which can
be discussed, assigned and remediated. Here you can raise issues or
view, comment on, and request to act on open issues.

There are a number of official and other social media accounts, on
various networks. You can find details of these documented on the
[Marketing Social
Networks](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_social_networks) Wiki
page.

## Etiquette {#_etiquette}

In all our interactions, we aspire to *be excellent to each other*. Read
the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.xml) to learn more of what is
expected of Fedora community members.

# Getting Help {#_getting_help}

There are several places to find help:

## Quick Docs {#_quick_docs}

Firstly, [Fedora Quick
Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/) is a collection
of short HOWTO and FAQ style documentation for Fedora users.

## Fedora Documentation {#_fedora_documentation}

Then there is the [official
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/). Many answers
can be found here. If you don't find what you need in the documentation
or you need more detail, you can ask a question via the forums below.

## Fedora Discussion {#_fedora_discussion_2}

Fedora has a strong community that is ready to help you. Because users
and contributors span the globe, a key element to the project is
communication. See the [Project Communications](communications.xml) page
for more details.

[Ask Fedora](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) is the
main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora
Project within Fedora Discussion (below). Visit Ask Fedora for support
and troubleshooting help.

Within [Fedora Discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/) you
will find all the latest news &amp; announcements. It is also the place
to talk about open source projects, workflows, and Fedora-specific
offerings such as the Editions: Fedora Workstation, Fedora Server,
Fedora CoreOS, Fedora Silverblue, and more&#8230;.

## Fedora Chat {#_fedora_chat}

[Fedora's official chat platform](https://chat.fedoraproject.org)
(powered by Matrix) is the place to go for more synchronous, real time
communication. Fedora Chat on Matrix is the preferred platform for the
future of Fedora Chat, however many of the Fedora Linux channels on IRC
at Libera Chat are still bridged to Fedora Chat on Matrix to allow
continued use of IRC during the transition.

If you're interested in &#42;why&#42; Fedora's primary communications
are moving to Matrix, check out [this
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2A8BdU1gKg) on the Fedora
YouTube channel by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller.

## Bugzilla {#_bugzilla}

If you believe you've found a bug you can report it through
[Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/). The [\'Using
Bugzilla\'](quick-docs::bugzilla/index.xml) page will give you any
guidance you need to do this. You can also ask on [Ask Fedora (as
above)](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none) to get advice
on filing a good bug report.

# Get Involved {#_get_involved}

![Welcome to Fedora banner](Welcome-to-Fedora-banner.png)

Welcome to Fedora!

This guide is intended for people that are interested in learning more
about Fedora, perhaps with the intention of getting involved and
contributing to the community.

You can refer to the [Getting Help](help.xml) and [Project
Communications](communications.xml) pages for more specific information
on how to find assistance via documentation and the various
communication channels, such as Ask Fedora, and Fedora Chat (powered by
Matrix).

## What is Fedora? {#_what_is_fedora_2}

As described under [Mission and Foundations](index.xml), the Fedora
Project is a community of people working together to build a Free and
Open Source software platform: the [Fedora Operating
System](https://getfedora.org), and its various editions. You can learn
more about the Project; our leadership; brand; current Community
Initiatives and how we are organised using the pages linked in the left
hand sidebar.

If you are looking to contribute and already have an idea of how and
what to do, go ahead and get started! If you are not so sure, read on.

## Contributing to Fedora {#_contributing_to_fedora}

Fedora is a [massive global organisation](orgchart.xml) where people
with many different skills carry out [different
roles](fedora-join::index.xml) to keep the community ticking along. All
services used by the Fedora community are linked to a central Fedora
account. If you're intending to get involved you should get one
[here](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/).

There is an excellent [article in Fedora
Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-contribute-to-fedora/)
covering in some detail the various ways you might get started.

## Not sure where to start? Come hang out with us! {#_not_sure_where_to_start_come_hang_out_with_us}

The large scale of the community can sometimes make it a little daunting
for new folks to join us. There is far too much happening in Fedora all
the time\-\--even we find it hard to keep up with it all! So, if you are
not sure of where to begin or have any queries at all, come hang out
with the [Fedora Join Special Interest Group
(SIG)](fedora-join::index.xml) on any of our channels:

- Chat (over Matrix/Element): [Join Fedora on
  Matrix/Element](https://chat.fedoraproject.org/&#35;/room/&#35;join:fedoraproject.org),

- Email: [Fedora Join mailing
  list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/),

Here, you can speak to community members and other newcomers while we
explore Fedora together. We will help you learn the systems and
processes that the Fedora community uses, and as you gain a better idea
of where you would like to contribute, we will also help you learn the
skills that you may need.

Taking initiative is an important quality in successful contributors.
So, go on, join a channel and introduce yourself to the community now!

# Sponsorship {#_sponsorship}

Fedora has thousands of regular contributors who give freely of their
time and efforts on a continual basis. Participating in the community is
a great way to support Fedora.

Companies may also choose to sponsor the annual [Flock to Fedora
conference](https://flocktofedora.org/) or our other in-person or
virtual events. These events connect our community and power the
collaboration that makes the Fedora Project work. Sponsorships allow us
to bring together contributors from around the world --- including
people who might otherwise be unable to join. Contact
<sponsors@fedoraproject.org> for more information.

To mirror the package repositories, see the [Mirroring
page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring) or

# Fedora Code of Conduct {#_fedora_code_of_conduct}

Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community,
Organization for Ethical Source, Python Software Foundation, Emma Irwin
v2.1, 2026-01-15 :page-aliases: council::policy/coc-response-policy.adoc

The Fedora Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our
community behaves and what we value to members and outsiders. The Fedora
Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and if it
is deemed necessary.

The Fedora Code of Conduct is not "code" in the sense of being an
algorithm or a computer program. The Fedora Code of Conduct is not
"blindly and algorithmically" executed but is instead enforced by humans
making real decisions based on all of the available information and
using all available context.

The Fedora Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize
non-native speakers of English. Instead the Fedora Code of Conduct
spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be
acceptable or unacceptable. The Fedora Code of Conduct is, in many ways,
the outward embodiment of the Friends component of Fedora's Foundations.

## Our Pledge {#pledge}

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
the Fedora community pledge to collaborate in a respectful and
constructive manner, and welcome everyone willing to join us in that
pledge. We welcome individuals regardless of ability, age, background,
body size, education, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and
expression, geographic location, level of experience, marital status,
nationality, national origin, native language, personal appearance, race
and/or ethnicity, religion, sexual identity and orientation,
socioeconomic status, or any other dimension of diversity.

Our channels, mailing lists, and posts should focus on Fedora and on
free and open source software and content. We pledge to make
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone. We pledge to avoid personal attacks on others,
and to avoid inflammatory language and speech that perpetuates
discrimination. Furthermore, we pledge to not use the Fedora Project and
its platforms as a basis to engage in personal campaigns against other
organizations or individuals.

## Our Standards {#standards}

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

&#42; Using welcoming and inclusive language &#42; Being kind to others
&#42; Behaving with civility &#42; Being respectful of differing
viewpoints and experiences &#42; Gracefully accepting constructive
criticism &#42; Focusing on what is best for the community &#42; Showing
empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

&#42; The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
attention or advances &#42; Initiating controversy for controversy's
sake (repeatedly asking disingenuous questions under a guise of
sincerity) &#42; Saying insulting/derogatory comments and making
personal attacks. &#42; Repeatedly instigating conflict, and baiting
people into arguments &#42; Public or private harassment &#42;
Publishing someone else's private information, such as a physical or
electronic address, without explicit permission &#42; Deliberate
intimidation, stalking, or following &#42; Violent threats or language
directed against another person &#42; Sexist, racist, homophobic,
transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary statements, even if they were
meant as jokes &#42; Excessive swearing &#42; Unwelcome physical contact
&#42; Sustained disruption of talks or other events &#42; Other conduct
which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
setting even if the conduct may be legal under the laws of some
jurisdiction.

## Our Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

The Fedora Council is committed to enforcing this Fedora Code of Conduct
in a fair and impartial manner so that Fedora community members are able
to participate in the Fedora Project and its associated activities in a
safe and respectful environment. To achieve this, the Council has
delegated responsibility to a [Fedora Code of Conduct
Committee](committee.xml) for clarifying and interpreting the standards
of acceptable behavior, responding to and investigating reports of
behavior that is not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct and
determining appropriate and fair corrective action in response. The
Committee will perform these functions along with the Red Hat Legal
team, as appropriate.

Within their respective areas of participation Fedora Community members
have the right in their sole discretion and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct. Those
Fedora Community members are expected to exercise these rights in
alignment with the Fedora Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Fedora Code of Conduct applies in all online and offline project
spaces and in all online and offline spaces where an individual is
representing the project, its community, or is acting as a community
member.

Examples of acting as a community member include:

&#42; Posting to a Fedora mailing list, &#42; Filing a bug with Fedora,
&#42; Participating in official Fedora communication channels (i.e.
Fedora Discussion, Fedora Chat/Matrix) &#42; Contributing to the Fedora
Project in any form &#42; Using an official project email address &#42;
Posting via an official social media account &#42; Acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event &#42; Speaking
for Fedora or its subprojects at a public event or online video &#42;
Working in a Fedora or related booth or table at an event &#42;
Participating in a Fedora or related technical meetup &#42; Serving as
an elected or appointed leader in Fedora, including being a member of
the Fedora Council

## Reporting and Enforcement {#reporting}

Instances of behavior inconsistent with this code may be reported by
contacting the Fedora project by filing a private Fedora Code of Conduct
ticket at <https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue>. If the incident occurs at
an event, the local event staff should be contacted in addition to
opening a ticket.

Individuals without access to <https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue> may send
an email to the following address: <codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org>.
This email will be converted into a private Fedora Code of Conduct
ticket by the [Fedora Code of Conduct Committee](committee.xml).

All reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with
anyone we will anonymize details as much as we can. This means that the
identities of all involved parties will remain confidential unless those
individuals instruct us otherwise or we are required to make disclosures
under the law. Additionally, in some cases we may need to disclose this
information to other parties at Red Hat. Fedora is not a separate legal
entity and therefore has to comply with all requirements imposed upon
Red Hat.

Upon our review/investigation of the reported incident, we will
determine what action is appropriate based on this Code and its
clarifying statements. An incident review will include communication
with the reporter and the individual being reported, and an opportunity
for both parties to provide an account of the incident.

All complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response. Failure
to follow this Code may result in actions including, but not limited to,
warnings, temporary suspension, and in extreme circumstances, banning
from the Fedora Project. Please note, while we take all
concerns/reported incidents raised seriously, we will use our discretion
to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents.

### Our Stance on Retaliation {#retaliation}

The Fedora Project is committed to ensuring that community members feel
safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative
consequences. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good
faith, reports a potential violation of this Fedora Code of Conduct or
assists in its investigation.

#### Protection for Reporters and Participants {#protection-from-retaliation}

No one should face threats, harassment, discrimination, or any other
form of retaliation for:

&#42; Making a good faith report of behavior they believe violates this
Fedora Code of Conduct. &#42; Participating in the investigation of a
Fedora Code of Conduct report, including serving as a witness or
providing information. This protection explicitly extends to members of
the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee in the execution of their duties.

\'Good faith\' means that you honestly believe the information you are
providing is accurate, even if an investigation does not ultimately
confirm the violation.

Acts of retaliation are serious violations of this Fedora Code of
Conduct. The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will address any confirmed
instance of retaliation with appropriate corrective action, consistent
with the enforcement of other Fedora Code of Conduct violations. If you
believe you are being retaliated against, please report it to the Fedora
Code of Conduct Committee using the same reporting channels outlined in
the \'Reporting and Enforcement\' section.

#### Addressing False Reports {#false-reports}

We expect all community members to act responsibly when making reports.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will investigate all reports. If
the Committee determines, after thorough investigation, that a report
was intentionally made with false information and with malicious intent
(for example, to harass or silence someone), this action itself will be
considered a violation of the Code of Conduct. An unsubstantiated
report, when made in good faith, is not considered a false report.

Covenant, version 1.4 along with material from the PyCon Code of Conduct

# Clarifying Notes and Statements {#_clarifying_notes_and_statements}

Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community v2.1,
2026-01-15 :page-aliases: project::coc-clarifying.adoc

The [Fedora Code of Conduct](index.xml) (CoC) outlines our shared values
and standards. However, applying these high-level principles to specific
situations requires clarity. The Fedora Code of Conduct and its
associated documents are "living documents." They will change over time
as the Fedora community changes. This supplemental document serves as an
extension of the main policy, to provide additional background and
clarification to the Fedora CoC. It ensures that enforcement is
consistent and that community members understand how the Fedora CoC
applies to real-world scenarios, including event visibility and the
protections afforded to those who report violations.

## Visibility and Awareness {#visibility}

A Code of Conduct is only effective if the community is aware of it and
understands the reporting procedures. To ensure this transparency, the
following standards apply to all Fedora operations:

&#42; &#42;Digital Presence&#42;: The Fedora Code of Conduct and its
associated documents must be linked in the footer of all major Fedora
websites and, where possible, in other project communications.

&#42; &#42;Event Prominence&#42;: All events must prominently display
the Fedora Code of Conduct. Organizers must publish event-specific
notes, including designated points of contact.

&#42; &#42;In-Person Reporting&#42;: If an event supports in-person
reporting, the specific process for doing so must be clearly and
prominently displayed.

&#42; &#42;Physical Signage&#42;: In-person events organized by Fedora
must provide physical copies of the Fedora Code of Conduct or display
clear signage regarding it for attendees.

&#42; &#42;Online Events&#42;: Virtual events must display a link to the
Fedora Code of Conduct prominently on the event home page.

&#42; &#42;Registration Acknowledgement&#42;: Where the platform allows,
online events should require attendees to agree to abide by the Fedora
Code of Conduct as a mandatory step in the registration process.

## Why was the word "contributor" from the Contributor Covenant adapted when it was adapted for Fedora? {#adapting-contributor}

We need a Code of Conduct that speaks to everyone who interacts with our
community. Many of us may understand the word "contributor" to encompass
everyone from a mailing list participant, forum poster, bug reporter,
documentarian, designer, developer, etc., but not everyone understands
it this way. Additionally, many of our events are attended by users.
Speaking about the community is a more clear definition of the
individuals covered in this Code.

## Rationale for Retaliation Clause (v2.1) {#retaliation}

This update codifies a zero-tolerance stance on retaliation to ensure
community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without
fear of negative consequences. Any confirmed act of retaliation is
considered a serious, standalone violation of the Fedora CoC and will be
met with appropriate corrective action. The new section explicitly
extends protections to reporters, witnesses, and Fedora Code of Conduct
Committee members acting in good faith. Additionally, it distinguishes
between unsubstantiated good-faith claims and malicious false reporting,
establishing the latter as a violation to preserve the integrity of the
enforcement process.

As of version 2.1, the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee has explicitly
codified our stance on retaliation to close a critical gap in community
safety. It was determined that for the Fedora CoC to be truly effective,
reporters must feel empowered to come forward without fear of
professional or social backlash. Silence caused by fear of retribution
undermines the health of the entire project.

# Fedora Code of Conduct Committee {#_fedora_code_of_conduct_committee}

The Code of Conduct Committee consists of the Fedora Project Leader, the
Fedora Community Architect, and Fedora community members. Members of the
Code of Conduct Committee will be provided with incident response
training and guidelines around Fedora's [Code of
Conduct](index.adoc&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement).

## Members

The current Code of Conduct Committee is comprised of:

&#42; Jef Spaleta ([Fedora Project Leader](council::fpl.xml)) &#42;
Justin Wheeler ([Fedora Community Architect](council::fca.xml)) &#42;
Jona Azizaj ([DEI Advisor](dei:roles:council-advisor.xml)) &#42; Dave
Cantrell (Fedora Council &amp; FESCo member) &#42; Ankur Sinha (Fedora
community member) &#42; Chris Onoja Idoko (Fedora community member)

## Responsibilities of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee {#responsibilities}

The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will:

&#42; Accept, acknowledge, and investigate reports of possible
violations of the Code of Conduct from community members and/or
moderators. This will include communications with people who submit
reports, reported persons, witnesses, and Red Hat Legal, as appropriate.
This will also involve communications with other members of the
Committee by text or video call to deliberate and resolve reports.
Additional details about the reporting and response processes are
documented on the [Reporting Process Information
page](index.adoc&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement). &#42; In cases where a
Code of Conduct violation has occurred, determine what action should be
taken by the Fedora Project. These will typically take the form of
remedial guidance, a set of consequences for the reported person, and/or
possible recommendations for new policies or rules for the Fedora
Project. &#42; Accept and acknowledge requests for clarifications about
the Code of Conduct, and provide a response once any necessary
communications and deliberations are complete. &#42; Make reporting as
appropriate about incidents, including an annual report summarizing
incidents over the last year. &#42;&#42; This report will be statistical
in nature to illustrate the process is functioning. &#42;&#42; Past
reports can be found under the [Code of Conduct
tag](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/code-of-conduct/) on
the Community Blog.

## Adding or Removing Members to the Code of Conduct Committee {#adding-removing}

The Fedora Project Leader and Fedora Community Architect are members of
the Code of Conduct Committee, regardless of who holds these roles.
Ideally, the Committee should have at least three members at all times,
and no more than seven. The Fedora Council will be notified of all
changes in membership to the Fedora Conduct Committee. Adding and
removing members to the Committee will happen from time to time for a
variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:

&#42; Particular Community members' interest in maintenance of Fedora
community health &#42; A Committee member no longer has the time or
desire to maintain Committee responsibilities &#42; A Committee member
fails to uphold the Code of Conduct Committee Commitments &#42;
Disengagement or absence in Committee activities lasting beyond one
Fedora Linux release cycle (i.e. ≥4 months)

### Adding a Member to the Code of Conduct Committee {#adding}

To add a member to the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee:

&#42; Current members of the Code of Conduct Committee or the Fedora
Council identifies a prospective member and obtains interest in and
commitment to participation, then files an issue proposing the member's
nomination. &#42; The Code of Conduct Committee reviews the nomination
to determine eligibility. Suitability will be determined by evaluation
of the nominee's behavior and track record of interactions in the Fedora
community. &#42; If the nomination is accepted, the Committee invites
the nominee to join the Code of Conduct Committee in a formal
communication. This invitation must include the
xref:&#35;commitments\[Code of Conduct Committee Commitments\] that
members must agree to follow to ensure Fedora's Code of Conduct is
managed fairly and in a confidential manner. &#42; If the nomination is
rejected, the Committee sends a notification of the rejection. A
rejected nominee will be eligible for renomination after two release
cycles. &#42; Upon acceptance of the invitation and acknowledgement and
agreement to the xref:&#35;commitments\[Code of Conduct Committee
Commitments\], Fedora will provide the new member with Code of Conduct
incident management training. &#42; Addition of the new member to Code
of Conduct incident tracker and documentation.

### Removing a Member from the Code of Conduct Committee {#removing}

The process to remove a member of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee
is notice from:

&#42; The member to the Committee that they intend to step down, or
&#42; The Committee to the member that they have been removed, and why
they have been removed.

Followed by removal of the individual from the CoC incident tracker and
documentation.

## Fedora Code of Conduct Committee Commitments {#commitments}

Members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee involved in
investigating reports and making recommendations for resolution of Code
of Conduct violations are required to uphold the following principles,
ensuring that bias, lack of confidentiality and conflicts of interest do
not impact the outcome of a Code of Conduct determination.

&#42;&#42;I agree to adhere to the Fedora Code of Conduct, in both
letter and spirit, and acknowledge that violating the Code could result
in removal from the Committee.&#42;&#42;

&#42;&#42;I agree to keep the process, any facts I learn, and any
evidence I review confidential, and agree to discuss them only with
individuals who are part of the process&#42;&#42; (e.g. Fedora Code of
Conduct Committee members, Red Hat Legal, or other designated
individuals).

&#42;&#42;I will recuse myself if I cannot be fair and impartial in an
individual case, due to my personal involvement with the parties
involved.&#42;&#42; If I have questions about recusal, I will consult
the Fedora Community Architect and/or the Fedora Project Leader.

&#42;&#42;I agree that I will review Code of Conduct reports, conduct
investigations, and make recommendations fairly and
impartially.&#42;&#42;

&#42;&#42;I will review the reports and deliberate only in confidential
sessions, with the outcome to be shared only with the parties and others
as determined on a need-to-know basis.&#42;&#42; (e.g. system
administrators, moderators, or project leads.)

&#42;&#42;I will respect the process and outcome, recognizing that the
Committee decision is the product of the Code of Conduct Committee, even
if I do not personally agree, my recommendations are rejected, or I am
part of the minority.&#42;&#42;

Please respond with acknowledgement that you have reviewed these
commitments and agree to follow them in your role as a member of the
Fedora Code of Conduct Committee.

## History {#history}

The Committee structure was [approved by the Fedora
Council](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/442) in April

# {team_name} Charter {#_team_name_charter}

![The Fedora Council logo features a stylized \'f\' in white within a
light blue circle](council-logo.png)

{team_summary}

The {team_name} is composed of a mix of representatives from different
areas of the project, named roles appointed by Red Hat, and a variable
number of seats connected to medium-term project goals. Decisions are
made by a &#42;consensus process&#42;, in which we work together as a
common team to find shared solutions and address concerns, with a focus
on giving voice rather than on balance of power.

The {team_name} is ultimately accountable for the Fedora Project as a
whole, and is responsible for providing advice to and oversight of other
Fedora governance bodies and teams as needed.

## Responsibilities

The {team_name} is responsible for issues of strategic importance for
Fedora that require leadership and coordination across the various teams
and sub-projects to achieve. &#42;Its primary role is to identify the
short, medium, and long term goals of the Fedora community and to
organize and enable the project to best achieve them&#42;. This is done
in consultation with the entire Fedora community through transparent,
public discussion.

{team_name} members engage with people across the community to make sure
Fedora is functioning smoothly and that teams are empowered to do
interesting and meaningful things. They decide on issues regarding use
of the Fedora &#42;trademarks&#42;, are responsible for final
&#42;arbitration of complaints&#42; related to project policies and for
&#42;settling disputes&#42; escalated from other committees or
subgroups. They may handle &#42;sensitive legal or personnel issues&#42;
which require research and discussion to protect the interests of the
Fedora Project or its sponsors.

To support project efforts with more ambitious scope, the {team_name}
sponsors [Community Initiatives](project::initiatives.xml) proposed by
the community. {team_name} members serve as [Executive
Sponsors](project::initiatives.adoc&#35;proposing-sponsors) for these
Initiatives, working personally to ensure that the
&lt;&lt;composition\--initiative-leads,Leads&gt;&gt; have everything
they need to succeed.

The {team_name} &#42;governs Fedora's financial resources&#42;, working
with our sponsor to establish an annual budget allocated to support
these Initiatives, various Fedora teams and programs, Fedora-managed
events, and other activities which advance the Fedora Strategy.

The {team_name} is also responsible for developing, tracking, and
updating the Fedora Strategy.

## Making Decisions {#decisions}

:::: sidebar
::: title
:::

&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Consensus decision-making aims to be:
::::

&#42; &#42;Agreement Seeking:&#42; A consensus decision-making process
attempts to help everyone get what they need. &#42;
&#42;Collaborative:&#42; Participants contribute to a shared proposal
and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group
members as much as possible. &#42; &#42;Cooperative:&#42; Participants
in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best
possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than
competing for personal preferences. &#42; &#42;Egalitarian:&#42; All
members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded, as much
as possible, equal input into the process. All members have the
opportunity to present, and amend proposals. &#42; &#42;Inclusive:&#42;
As many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus
decision-making process. &#42; &#42;Participatory:&#42; The consensus
process should actively solicit the input and participation of all
decision-makers.

--- from [Wikipedia on Consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making&#35;Objectives)
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;

Many basic decisions are made through a process known as "&#42;lazy
approval&#42;", in which general consent is assumed unless valid
objections are raised within a period of time --- generally three to
seven days, although the timeframe should be stated each time and should
be proportionate to the impact of the action. This process is used for
decisions with short-term consequences and which can be easily reversed.
Any project member can ask for the deadline to be extended or the
decision escalated to require full consensus.

More significant decisions are made through a process of &#42;full
consensus&#42;. In order to pass, these decisions need three positive
votes (+3) and *no* negative votes (-1). A negative vote immediately
halts the process and requires discussion. Therefore, in order to remain
valid, negative votes must be supported with a specific concerns about
the proposal, and suggestions for what could be changed in order to make
the proposal acceptable. A vote of "0" is sometimes used to indicate a
disagreement but willingness to stand aside; this should also be
accompanied with an explanation.

This model matches Fedora's "Friends" foundation, which calls for
finding acceptable consensus to serve the interests of advancing free
software. It works because we work together in a community of mutual
respect even when we disagree.

In general, the {team_name} conducts business in public discussion, and
any Fedora project member can make negative or positive votes. It is the
duty of the {team_name} to take concerns raised in this way into serious
consideration, but only {team_name} members\' votes are binding in the
final tally.

When consensus cannot be reached, the {team_name} may ask the [Fedora
Project Leader](fpl.xml) to decide on a resolution. Such a request can
be made when issues leading to negative votes are outstanding and all
{team_name} members agree that the {team_name} is deadlocked, or if the
dispute is unresolved after fourteen days and a simple majority of
{team_name} members are in favor of the request.

## Composition

### Community Initiative Leads {#composition--initiative-leads}

On an ongoing basis, including sessions at Flock and in public online
meetings, the {team_name} will identify two to four key [Community
Initiatives](project::initiatives.xml) with a timeframe of approximately
eighteen months, and appoint &#42;Community Initiative Leads&#42; for
each goal. Each [Community Initiative](project::initiatives.xml) is
represented by one {team_name} seat. Typically, this seat is filled by
the Lead of the Initiative, although it is possible for two people (at
most) to share a single {team_name} seat as Co-Leads. While naturally
the people in these roles will focus primarily on their own Initiative,
this is a full {team_name} position and Community Initiative Leads are
invited to participate in all {team_name} activities and decisions.

:::: note
::: title
:::

This policy may be surprising, but we have found that this wider
engagement connects the specific work to everything going on in Fedora,
leading to greater success for the Initiative. Community Initiative
Leads may even serve as Executive Sponsors for other Initiatives.
::::

Community Initiative Leads typically serve on the {team_name} for the
duration of their Initiative. When the Initiative concludes, the
{team_name} term also expires.

Each Community Initiative Lead is paired with an [Executive
Sponsor](project::initiatives.adoc&#35;proposing-sponsors), who is
another member of the {team_name}.

Community Initiatives must be documented with measurable goals. The
Community Initiative Leads are responsible for coordinating efforts to
reach those goals, evaluating and reporting on progress, and working
regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that progress is
made. [Executive
Sponsors](project::initiatives.adoc&#35;proposing-sponsors) are
responsible for making sure the Initiative is on track and for removing
blockers.

### Representatives {#composition-representatives}

The {team_name} also includes five representative seats: an
&#42;Engineering Representative&#42;, a &#42;Mindshare
Representative&#42;, a [&#42;DEI
Advisor&#42;](dei:roles:council-advisor.xml), and two &#42;Elected
Representatives&#42;.

#### Engineering &amp; Mindshare Representatives {#composition--representatives--engineering-mindshare}

"Engineering" and "Mindshare" are broad areas roughly encompassing two
of the major areas of activity in Fedora. *Engineering* is the technical
work related to building and releasing the Fedora operating system and
the infrastructure related to that. *Mindshare* includes marketing,
design, and Fedora Ambassadors --- largely activities that happen
between Fedora and the world at large, with the distribution release
cycle serving as a fuel source, not the thing that's being worked on.

The engineering and mindshare representatives\' responsibility is to
represent their areas collectively, *not* to be just an individual voice
that happens to be voted-in by some subset of Fedora. They are selected
by contributors working in those areas, under the rules of the [Fedora
Engineering Steering Committee
(FESCo)](fesco::Fedora_Council_Engineering_Rep.xml) and the [Mindshare
Committee](mindshare-committee::procedures/council_rep.xml),
respectively.

#### Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Advisor {#composition-representatives-dei}

The [&#42;Fedora Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI)
Advisor&#42;](dei:roles:council-advisor.xml) is a liaison between the
{team_name} and the Fedora community on topics and issues related to
diversity, equity, and inclusion in Fedora. The DEI Advisor works with
{team_name} leadership to represent perspectives and voices of the
Fedora community in decision-making and project discussions. This
position is appointed by members of the [Fedora DEI
Team](dei::index.xml), with the approval of the {team_name}.

#### Elected Representatives {#composition-representatives-elected}

The elected positions cover all Fedora subprojects that are not under
the engineering or mindshare banners, and the community at large. One
specific responsibility is to represent the voice of individual
contributors to the Fedora Project. Each representative will also work
on specific goals which they bring to the {team_name} as highlighted
during the election process.

Elections are held once per year, in concert with the joint Fedora
election cycle. Two seats are selected at the even-numbered release
election, e.g F40, F42, etc, and each position has a two-election
(approximately one year) term. This change came into effect from the F40
election, following a council vote on
\[<https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/470> this ticket\] at
the 2024 council hackfest. No person who currently holds another
{team_name} seat can be elected. If a seat becomes vacant, the
{team_name} will arrange for a temporary replacement.

### Appointed Leadership Positions {#composition-appointed}

#### Fedora Project Leader (FPL) {#composition-appointed-fpl}

The [Fedora Project Leader](fpl.xml) (FPL) serves as the chair of the
{team_name}, organizing discussion agendas, bringing issues to the
table, and facilitating the consensus process. He or she is accountable
for success in all areas of the project, but is not a dictator,
benevolent or otherwise. The FPL often serves as the public face and
collective voice of the project, and has a corresponding duty to listen
to, understand, and fairly represent the collective views and needs of
project contributors and stakeholders.

The Fedora Project Leader is hired by Red Hat with the advice and
consent of the {team_name}.

#### Fedora Community Architect (FCA) {#composition-appointed-fca}

The [Fedora Community Architect](fca.xml) (FCA) works to grow the Fedora
user and developer communities, and to make Red Hat / Fedora
interactions even more transparent and positive. The Fedora community
budget comes to us through the Red Hat Open Source Program Office, and
this position facilitates decision-making on how to best focus that to
meet our collective objectives.

#### Fedora Operations Architect {#composition-appointed-foa}

The [Fedora Operations Architect](foa.xml) (FOA) is employed full-time
by Red Hat to assist the community in managing technical changes. This
includes oversight of the Change process, schedule management,
communications, and ownership of key strategic efforts. They also assist
with the creation, improvement, maintenance, and execution of formal,
repeatable Fedora processes. Additionally, the Fedora Operations
Architect serves as record-keeper and secretary for Fedora Council
Meetings.

## Coda

### Meetings {#coda-meetings}

The {team_name} is not driven by meetings or by tickets, but does hold
[regular public meetings]({url_wiki}/Council_Meetings) (via a chat
system or video call). The {team_name} discusses current issues, clear
through anything outstanding which can be quickly resolved, and to
ensure that nothing urgent is left pending. All members are expected to
regularly communicate what is going on in their area, through blog posts
or other public updates.

The {team_name} holds a multi-day, face-to-face meeting annually. All
members should strive to attend in person (travel funding is available).
We also often meet for a day before or after other significant
Fedora-related conferences (Flock, DevConf.cz). These meetings are not
public, but minutes and summary documents will be provided.

Additionally, the [Fedora Project Leader](fpl.xml) will set aside
regular times to meet with the community. Attendance is not mandatory
for all {team_name} members but is encouraged.

### Transparency {#coda-transparency}

The general policy of the {team_name} is to default to open. Most
meetings are held in public channels, and open to all Fedora users and
contributors. Discussion is held in a [public
forum]({team_asynch_communication}) open to all, and formal decisions
will be recorded in a public ticket tracking system.

Occasionally, when personal, private, or sensitive issues need to be
discussed, a video call might be used. A private mailing list and ticket
tracking instance also exist for these situations, but will also only be
used when dealing with these uncommon issues.

### Time Commitment {#coda-time}

Serving on the {team_name} is a significant commitment of time and
energy. Workload for the various roles will vary, but each will require
a number of hours every week, and in most cases, the more, the better a
{team_name} member is able to do the job fully.

We recognize that most Fedora community members do not have the luxury
of working on Fedora full-time or as part of a paid position. The time
commitment required for these roles comes simply from what is required
to lead a large project like Fedora, and is not intended to be an
artificial limit on who can participate. We know that that it can be a
*pragmatic* limit, and for that reason, the {team_name} is responsible
for extra effort to receive, recognize, be responsive to, and
meaningfully reward the input of contributors offering their individual
time.

### Governance Philosophy {#coda-governance}

To advance free software, we need to provide a sustainable integration
of free software without cutting corners. By providing a positive first
impression before and during installation and real use, we support
Fedora's reputation as a leading and reliable product that attracts
future users and contributors. To provide that integration and
experience we must have a clear set of priorities to help all
contributors decide how to allocate resources and resolve conflicts.
These priorities are not meant to be exclusive, or to keep contributors
from working on the parts of Fedora that matter to them.

These priorities will sometimes expose gaps where contributors need
additional assistance, and allow them to seek it both within the
community and by bringing in additional contributors to help,
exclusively on their particular interest area if desired. While
narrowing our focus in some areas, though, we must provide opportunities
for exploration to all contributors within the framework of our core
values and without impeding progress.

### Historical Note {#coda-historical}

The previous [previous governance structure (Fedora
Board)]({url_wiki}/Board) had five members directly appointed by Red Hat
and five elected at large. The current structure is more complicated but
has a much greater proportion of members selected by the community by
election or merit. In the previous board structure, the [Fedora Project
Leader](fpl.xml) had a special veto power; in the current model, all
voting members can block on issues, with a valid reason. The FPL does
not have a special veto, but does have a limited power to "unstick"
things if consensus genuinely cannot be reached and a decision needs to
be made.

### Record of Former Members {#coda--former-members}

Former membership on the {team_name}, along with membership on the
previous Fedora Board, is documented on the [History of {team_name}
Membership](history.xml) page.

## Document History

This charter was approved by the Fedora Project Board on [Oct. 9th,
2014](https://fedorahosted.org/council/ticket/13) and is in effect as of
Nov. 26th, 2014. Any other significant changes will be noted here;
smaller changes (minor wording or formatting, etc., without impact on
meaning) can be found in the [git
repository](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/commits/main)
for {team_name} documents.

1.  &#42;2014-11-26&#42;: Initial approval by the Fedora Project Board
    ([ticket]({team_issue_tracker}/issue/13)).

2.  &#42;2017-04-05&#42;: Switched "Outreach" to Mindshare

    Coordinator* to [*Fedora Community Architect*](fca.xml).

# Contacting the {team_name} {#_contacting_the_team_name}

The {team_name} uses three platforms for communications, one for
asynchronous, one for asynchronous, and one for decision-making. Anyone
registered with an account in the [Fedora Account
System](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org) (FAS) can log in with their
account to participate in either platform.

## {team_asynch_communication_name} (asynchronous) {#discussion}

The [&#42;&#35;council tag&#42;]({team_asynch_communication}) on
{team_asynch_communication_name} is the primary space for {team_name}
conversations. We use this for discussion within the {team_name} as a
team, and it is also the best place for any community member to engage
in or start a conversation with us.

### Private mailing list {#discussion-private}

We also have a private mailing list:
[&#42;council-private&#42;](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/council-private@lists.fedoraproject.org/).
Its membership is restricted to the current {team_name} members and
discussions there are not archived. This list is only used for topics
that cannot be discussed on the public forum. We use it as little as
possible.

## {team_synch_communication_name} (synchronous) {#chat}

{team_name} members are also often present on the
[&#42;&#35;council:fedoraproject.org&#42;
{team_synch_communication_name} room]({team_synch_communication}) on
[chat.fedoraproject.org](https://chat.fedoraproject.org).

## {team_issue_tracker_name} (decision-making) {#decisions}

It is better to start with an asynchronous conversation, described
above.

When you have a specific proposal for the {team_name} to make a
decision, open a ticket on the [&#42;{team_name}
{team_issue_tracker_name}&#42;]({team_issue_tracker}). This is a public
issue tracker. However, if you have a privacy- or security-sensitive
issue, check the &#42;Private&#42; box when you create the ticket. If an
issue is not sensitive, the discussion should open and public.

Note that ticket comments should be kept to a minimum. Discussion should
be at [&#35;council]({team_asynch_communication}) and the ticket used to
record procedural actions like votes and approved resolutions.

# The Fedora Project Leader {#_the_fedora_project_leader}

The *Fedora Project Leader* (or *FPL*) is ultimately accountable for
everything that happens within Fedora and in particular is responsible
for maintaining Red Hat's relationship with Fedora and vice versa. They
are Fedora's President, CEO, Chair, Fearless Leader,
whatever-you-want-to-call-it. However the project leader is not a
dictator, benevolent or otherwise. The FPL chairs the
[{team_name}](index.xml).

[Jef Spaleta]({url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta) is the current Fedora Project
Leader.

Jef has more than a decade of experience in the technology industry; as
software engineer, open source contributor, IoT hardware developer,
operations, and developer advocate. Prior to entering the technology
industry as a paid professional, he was a plasma physics researcher.
First in a Princeton lab work with fusion energy relevant experiments in
New Jersey as a graduate student, and then pretty much everywhere but a
lab building radars studying ionospheric plasmas as part of the
SuperDARN international collaboration while living in Alaska. During his
period as an academic researcher, he also was involved in the fedora.us
repository as a contributor, which susequently merged with Red Hat's
effort to build what became the Fedora Project. Jef was even an elected
Fedora Board member (the thing that pre-dated the Council) briefly
before his trips to Antartica and elsewhere made it impossible for him
to continue actively contributing to Fedora. Now he's back serving the
Fedora community after some time away.

He also curls..something he picked up in Alaska as a way to stay sane in
the long winters there.

### What about FCAIC and FCL? {#previous-titles}

The title of this role evolved and changed over the years since its
inception in February 2015. The creation of the role was largely
envisioned and advocated for by [Robyn Bergeron](fpl.adoc&#35;previous),
then the Fedora Project Leader. When the role was first created, the
role title was [&#42;Fedora Community Outreach and Impact
Lead&#42;](https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-community-action-and-impact-job-opening-red-hat-osas/),
which was often shortened to Fedora Community Lead (FCL). At the time,
the FCL role provided needed separation of responsibilities with the
[Fedora Project Leader](fpl.xml), including the role of organizing the
annual Fedora contributor conference, Flock. However, the FCL title did
not feel totally right either. Anyone can be a leader in the Fedora
community, whether they are employed by Red Hat or not! We did not want
to imply otherwise.

Later, in October 2016, the role title was changed to &#42;Fedora
Community Action &amp; Impact Coordinator&#42; (FCAIC). This title was
lengthier but better captured what community engagement means in a
large, globally-distributed community like Fedora. Over time, more
projects, organizations, and companies working on Free &amp; Open Source
Software (FOSS) introduced new roles in community management and
leadership. However, community work does not have an industry-accepted
job ladder, as is more common with software engineering. Red Hat
eventually settled on the title of *community architect* for community
work in its pioneering Open Source communities.

Fast forward to 2023. The landscape has changed and evolved! So, it was
the ideal time to reflect on the title for this role. The title was
changed in January 2023 to &#42;Fedora Community Architect&#42; (FCA).
Ultimately, the goal of changing the name was to better describe the
role and what the FCA does in Fedora. The lengthy \'FCAIC\' title
usually came with an explanation to others unfamiliar with Fedora and
our community culture. FCA is also a handy shortening of the longer
FCAIC acronym too!

In 2007, Red Hat began providing Fedora with assistance through a funded
role in the company's Program Management organization. In 2023,
structural changes at the company eliminated this position. The Fedora
Operations Architect is a new role situated in Linux Engineering at Red
Hat, designed to be more closely aligned in both definition and practice
with Fedora's unique needs.

&#42; Council Policies

# AI-Assisted Contributions Policy {#_ai_assisted_contributions_policy}

Jason Brooks; Fedora Council; Fedora community v1.0, 2025-10-24

1.  You &#42;MAY&#42; use AI assistance for contributing to Fedora, as
    long as you follow the principles described below.

2.  &#42;Accountability&#42;: You &#42;MUST&#42; take the responsibility
    for your contribution. Contributing to Fedora means vouching for the
    quality, license compliance, and utility of your submission. All
    contributions, whether from a human author or assisted by large
    language models (LLMs) or other generative AI tools, must meet the
    project's standards for inclusion. The contributor is always the
    author and is fully accountable for the entirety of these
    contributions.

3.  &#42;Transparency&#42;: You &#42;MUST&#42; disclose the use of AI
    tools when the significant part of the contribution is taken from a
    tool without changes. You &#42;SHOULD&#42; disclose the other uses
    of AI tools, where it might be useful. Routine use of assistive
    tools for correcting grammar and spelling, or for clarifying
    language, does not require disclosure. &#42;&#42; Information about
    the use of AI tools will help us evaluate their impact, build new
    best practices and adjust existing processes. &#42;&#42; Disclosures
    are made where authorship is normally indicated. For contributions
    tracked in git, the recommended method is an &#96;Assisted-by:&#96;
    commit message trailer. For other contributions, disclosure may
    include document preambles, design file metadata, translation notes,
    or [wiki page categories]({url_wiki}/Category:AI_Assistance_Used).
    &#42;&#42; Examples: &#42;&#42;&#42; &#96;Assisted-by: generic LLM
    chatbot&#96; &#42;&#42;&#42; &#96;Assisted-by: ChatGPTv5&#96;

4.  &#42;Contribution &amp; Community Evaluation&#42;: AI tools may be
    used to assist human reviewers by providing analysis and
    suggestions. You &#42;MUST NOT&#42; use AI as the sole or final
    arbiter in making a substantive or subjective judgment on a
    contribution, nor may it be used to evaluate a person's standing
    within the community (e.g., for funding, leadership roles, or Code
    of Conduct matters). This does not prohibit the use of automated
    tooling for objective technical validation, such as CI/CD pipelines,
    automated testing, or spam filtering. The final accountability for
    accepting a contribution, even if implemented by an automated
    system, always rests with the human contributor who authorizes the
    action.

5.  &#42;Large scale initiatives&#42;: The policy does not cover the
    large scale initiatives which may significantly change the ways the
    project operates or lead to exponential growth in contributions in
    some parts of the project. Such initiatives need to be discussed
    separately with the Fedora Council.

Concerns about possible policy violations should be reported via
{team_issue_tracker_name} private tickets [to Fedora

![License: CC BY
4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)

This policy page describes how Community Publishing Platforms are
defined, reviewed, and moderated. It provides a loose framework of how
moderation is handled in cases that [involve the Fedora
Trademark]({url_wiki}/Legal:Trademark_guidelines&#35;Community_sites_and_accounts).

## What are Community Publishing Platforms (or, Platforms)? {#what}

&#42;Community Publishing Platforms&#42;, shortened as
&#42;Platforms&#42;, are content-focused websites that publish Creative
Works with the Fedora Trademark. Platforms are places for expression of
ideas and thoughts specifically related to or in the interest of the
Fedora Project and its community.

### Examples

Creative Works include, but are not limited to, the following examples:

&#42; Blog posts &#42; Pictures or photographs &#42; Public social media
posts &#42; Other written communications depending on context

The {team_name} reserves the authority to modify or expand the
definition of Creative Works, based on unique context of the Fedora
Project and the Fedora Community.

Community Publishing Platforms include, but are not limited to, the
following examples:

&#42; [Community Blog]({url_commblog}) &#42;
[Planet](http://fedoraplanet.org/) &#42; Specific social media accounts
&#42;&#42; <https://www.facebook.com/TheFedoraProject> &#42;&#42;
<https://twitter.com/fedora> &#42;&#42;
<https://twitter.com/fedoracommunity> &#42;&#42;
<https://twitter.com/fedora_planet> &#42;&#42;
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIfca4LPFVn8-FjpPVc1ow> &#42;&#42;
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/> &#42;&#42;
<https://discord.gg/fedora> &#42;&#42; <https://telegram.me/fedoranews>
&#42;&#42; <https://www.instagram.com/thefedoraproject/>

## What content is appropriate for Platforms? {#content}

Community Publishing Platforms feature Creative Works controlled by but
not actively curated by the Fedora Community and Fedora Leadership.
Platforms may be provided on infrastructure or web services hosted and
managed by the Fedora Project or its sponsors. Community Publishing
Platforms are not actively curated because they rely on decentralized
community labor and contributions that are difficult to centrally
control.

Creative Works on Platforms must comply with the [Fedora Code of
Conduct](project:ROOT:code-of-conduct.xml). These Creative Works are not
officially endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, but must comply
with [existing trademark
rules]({url_wiki}/Legal:Trademark_guidelines&#35;Community_sites_and_accounts).
If the Fedora Trademark is used, it must comply to this policy.

## How to report a Creative Work {#report}

If you participate in an informally moderated Platform (e.g. Reddit,
Telegram, Discord, etc.), work with Platform moderators first to report
a Creative Work. For the provided examples, this could be a Sub-Reddit
moderator, a Telegram group admin, or a Discord server admin.

If you are unsuccessful in working with Platform moderators OR a
Platform moderator encourages you to do so, follow the reporting
guidelines in the [Fedora Code of
Conduct](project:ROOT:code-of-conduct.xml). Specific outcomes will fall
under the scope of the Fedora Code of Conduct.

# Guiding Policy {#_guiding_policy}

This guiding policy represents the way the {team_name} would like the
Project to make its mission a reality.

The Fedora Project's
[Vision](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/&#35;_our_mission)
is:

> *The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from
> free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and
> open-minded communities*.

To accomplish this, our
[Mission](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/&#35;_our_mission)
is:

> *Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
> containers that enables software developers and community members to
> build tailored solutions for their users*.

We do this within the context of the Four Foundations: Freedom, Friends,
Features, and First.

## Context

The {team_name} identifies the short-, medium-, and long-term goals
necessary to keep the Project on the leading edge of technology. The
Fedora.next initiative focused the outputs of the project around use
cases. In 2017, we updated the mission statement to reflect changes in
the computing landscape. Today, it is too difficult to build new
solutions in Fedora.

## Our Approach {#approach}

We will make it easy for the community to build solutions, address
specific developer problems, and meet their end users' specific needs.
We will do this by encouraging and helping Objectives which make the
necessary changes required to ease the process. This accelerates the
transformation of Fedora into a community that enables the construction
of solutions.

Internally, Fedora focuses on enabling these solutions to be built. The
outputs of Fedora are the Solutions our community members build. Our
focus on enablement allows experimentation without prior judgement or
gate-keeping.

## What does this mean? {#meaning}

Teams such as Design, Documentation, Packagers, Release Engineering, and
Quality Assurance provide building blocks and offer services to other
community members and Teams. Services and building blocks include the
following:

&#42; CI infrastructure &#42; Community building advice and guidance
&#42; Event funding &#42; Logo services &#42; RPM or other software
packages &#42; Swag &#42; Testing and validation &#42; User support
&#42; UX design

Anyone may use building blocks like software packages and artwork to
create a Solution. Example solutions include: Fedora Workstation, KDE
Plasma, and the Python Classroom Lab. Teams define criteria for services
they provide to solution-builders. For example, teams providing press
and promotional support may choose to provide additional support to
Solutions with larger user bases.

Teams are free to define elements of their Solutions, such as intent,
deliverables, and release cadence. Teams can build Solutions from any
building block and pick and choose what tools they use. Based on their
choices, they get different levels of ability to use the Fedora
trademark (i.e. "Fedora Remix" vs "Powered by" vs "Fedora"). Some
solutions are the premier showcases that we call Editions; these are
used in the gating tests for our releases.

# Policy Change policy {#_policy_change_policy}

Proposed changes to {team_name} policies must be publicly announced on
the [&#35;council tag on Fedora Discussion]({team_asynch_communication})
and in a [Fedora Community Blog]({url_commblog}) post in order to get
feedback from the community. After a minimum of two calendar weeks, the
{team_name} may vote on the proposed change using the &#42;full
consensus&#42; voting model. After approval, the change is reflected on
the [{team_name} policies page](policies.xml).

# Process for promoting a Fedora deliverable to Edition {#_process_for_promoting_a_fedora_deliverable_to_edition}

Fedora Editions are curated sets of packages, guidelines and
configuration, and artifacts built from those pieces, that address a
specific, targeted use-case. The Editions are the primary Fedora outputs
that most Fedora users are encouraged to use and directed towards
through the download site.

This document describes the process for promoting an existing Fedora
deliverable to Edition status.

## What makes an \'Edition\'? {#what-makes-edition}

A Fedora Edition:

&#42; addresses a sufficiently distinct, relevant, and broad use-case or
user-base that a Fedora Edition is not currently serving; &#42; is a
long term investment for the Fedora Project; and &#42; is consistent
with all of Fedora's Four Foundations.

## Prerequisites

&#42; The candidate Edition must be backed by a team that holds regular
public meetings. &#42; The candidate Edition must get trademark approval
from the {team_name}. If this includes a name change or a new name (e.g.
"Fedora Bilverslue"), plan time for legal review. &#42; The candidate
Edition must have a product requirements document (PRD)
([example]({url_wiki}/Workstation/Workstation_PRD)). The PRD is used by
other teams within Fedora. For example, the Quality Team uses it to
develop release criteria and test cases and the Marketing Team uses it
to develop collateral and positioning. The PRD must include: &#42;&#42;
Market target, including key use cases and personas. &#42;&#42; Core
services and features. &#42;&#42; Core applications. &#42;&#42; Unique
policies for installation, updates, etc. &#42;&#42; Scope of hardware
support (including anything that is explicitly unsupported). &#42;&#42;
Produced deliverables, and whether or not they should be considered
release blocking. &#42; The candidate Edition may have a technical
specification
([example]({url_wiki}/Workstation/Technical_Specification)) that
provides additional detail about the specific features described in the
PRD.

:::: tip
::: title
:::

It is helpful to have someone on the team assigned to handle the
bureaucratic tasks.
::::

## Process

When all of the prerequisites have been met and approved by the
{team_name}, the team submits promotion as a System-Wide Change. This
ensures that Release Engineering, FESCo, and the community at large have
the opportunity to provide input. It also implies that the promotion may
be delayed to the next release if the appropriate supporting pieces are
not in place by the Beta or GA freezes.

Prior to submitting the Change proposal, the following tasks should be
completed:

&#42; &#42;Approval from the {team_name}&#42;. File a ticket and
participate in related discussion. &#42; &#42;Review test cases and
release criteria with the Quality Team&#42;. The Quality Team will draft
test cases and release criteria based on the PRD. However, the Edition
team must verify that these are valid. The Edition team may choose to
assign a person to be the liaison with the Quality Team. &#42; &#42;Work
with Release Engineering&#42;. The Edition team should work with release
engineering on how they are planning on composing the new edition,
release process, mirrors sync locations, any changes needed to koji,
bodhi or autosigning.

After the change proposal is approved, the following additional tasks
should be completed no later than the Beta freeze, which should be
considered the contingency deadline for the change. Note that these
tasks should be started as early as possible.

&#42; &#42;Request design deliverables&#42;. If customized graphics for
the website, stickers, et cetera are needed, the Edition team should
contact the Design Team as soon as possible. &#42; &#42;Provide updated
website content&#42;. The Edition team should send text, graphics, and
screenshots to the Websites &amp; Apps Team as soon as possible to
ensure fedoraproject.org will be up-to-date on release day. &#42;
&#42;Notify Documentation and Translation teams&#42;. The Edition team
should let the Documentation team know of any updates or new
documentation required. The Edition team should also inform the
Translation team of incoming website and documentation updates so they
can prepare to translate it in advance of the release. &#42;
&#42;Provide marketing blurbs&#42;. The Edition team should send basic
promotional text to the Marketing and Magazine teams. This will allow
the release announcement, et cetera to include meaningful information
about the new Edition. The Edition team may consider writing one or
several full Fedora Magazine articles in support of the Edition.

## History {#history}

This policy was approved in [{team_name} ticket
&#35;296]({team_issue_tracker}/issue/296).

The policy was amended in October, 2024 to relax the \'distinct\'
requirement in [{team_name} ticket
&#35;507]({team_issue_tracker}/issue/507).

# Event DEI Location Policy {#_event_dei_location_policy}

This page describes the Event DEI Location policy, aiming to keep our
diversity commitment in mind when organizing a event.

## Goals

This policy goal is to make sure that a event location do not prevent
people from coming due to discriminatory laws that would realistically
impact attendance by marginalized members of the community. It was
written with the LGBTQIA+ community in mind, but should not be
restricted to it. To give a example, a law that prevent so-called \'LGBT
propaganda\' would create legal risk if the DEI team decide to have a
meeting, and so we should refrain from choosing such a location for a
international event. As another example, a law preventing abortion under
any circumstance would make pregnant people be wary of coming due to the
risk of not being able to get proper care in case of unforeseen
pregnancy related complications. This policy is written to be
supplemented with several criteria submitted by the community following
the process to add criteria outlined in this document.

## Non goals {#_non_goals}

This policy does not attempt to take in account travels and/or
passports/visa issues on purpose. While this greatly impact who can
travel and would fall under the goal of increasing community diversity,
this requires a different approach due to the complexity involved and
the fact that it almost always requires a arbitrary decision that depend
on the location of community members, the previous locations and current
geopolitical climate as well as budget.

This policy also explicitly do not cover the event venue itself and the
facilities used during the event, as this should be part of a separate
document.

This policy do not cover smaller events organized by a local team (like
a release party), as there is no expectation of international travel and
the audience wouldn't see its situation change wrt inclusivity. However,
the event are still bound by [Fedora
CoC](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/&#35;_our_standards).
Organizers are free to take that policy in account if their planned
event aim for a audience spanning multiple countries and need to decide
where to organise the event.

## Location evaluation process {#location}

Each covered event should be assessed by the Fedora DEI team in a timely
fashion (within a month). The Council will then have to decide based on
Fedora DEI team input, or take over the duty of assessing if the Fedora
DEI team is not able to do the assessment.

&#42; placeholder criteria (to be added later)

Feedback can be provided in advance before the formal review process is
started, and community members are encouraged to become familiar with
the requirements before submitting a proposal, and get in touch with DEI
team if they have any questions.

### Events covered {#_events_covered}

Only a event requiring international travel for a sizable portion of the
attendees shall be covered by that policy. Smaller events aiming at a
regional or national audience can be exempted of this policy.

For Fedora, this mean mostly Flock to Fedora, or a event that replace
it, as it aim to get the wider community from all around the world.
Hackfests tend to bring people from various countries and should be
covered too.

## Criteria evaluation {#criteriaevaluation}

### Laws priority order {#_laws_priority_order}

Criteria must be evaluated using the material applicability of laws,
with a focus on their locality. For example, if a country lack a
specific law used in a criteria, but a applicable law exists at a lower
administrative level such as a town and cover the proposed location,
then the closer applicable law will be taken in account. To give a
example, at the time of writing of this document (April 2024), same sex
unions are not recognized country-wide in Japan. However, since the
Ibaraki prefecture has a partnership system since 2019, a event in Mito
(capital of the prefecture) would be covered, and so a criteria based on
same sex unions recognition could be fulfilled.

### Timing of laws application {#_timing_of_laws_application}

The criteria would be evaluated at the time of the proposal and/or
decision. If a law is proposed but not yet voted, then it shouldn't be
taken in account. In a lot of country, there is plenty of laws proposed
with most not being discussed nor being signed. If a law is not enforced
in practice, but still exists, it should however be taken in account as
if it was enforced. In the event of a imminent vote (1 or 2 weeks) along
a rather high certainty of the result, a case-by-case exception can be
discussed for that. Proposed laws can be brought during discussion
outside of the process, and it is up to the Council to take that in
account, especially if there is a need for a arbitrage between multiple
locations.

### Survey and perceptions {#_survey_and_perceptions}

The criteria must be primarily based on laws, not survey or perceptions.
The main reason is that surveys and perceptions can be hard to get in a
consistent way across the world, and would requires to make a judgement
call based on changing numbers, which is less clear cut than the
presence or absence of laws. However, surveys and perceptions can be
taken in account during discussion, on a case by case basis, especially
if there is a need for arbitrage by the Council.

### Importance {#_importance}

Each criteria will result either \'met\' or \'not met\' result. If a
criteria is not met, it can be either a hard requirement (the proposal
is rejected on that criteria alone), or a soft requirement (the proposal
is not rejected just with that). Fedora Council can ignore a criteria
(hard or soft), but it must provides a public explanation and a detailed
reasoning for that. If all proposals for a event have at least one
criteria that is not met, Fedora Council will need to start a arbitrage
and should favor the one with the least amount of \'not met\' criteria
and the least amount of \'hard\' and \'not met\' criteria. It should
also provides a public and detailed reasoning around the arbitrage.

## Criteria Addition Process {#criteriaprocess}

Anyone in the project can submit a new criteria in the policy by opening
a ticket to the [DEI tracker](https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/).

To be considered, a proposal must provides the following information:

&#42; A name for the proposal. A pun in the acronym is not required, but
always appreciated. &#42; The name/FAS ID of 2 persons responsible for
pushing the proposal, answering to questions and submitting the changes
and merge requests. &#42; A rational explaining how it is related to
Fedora DEI team objectives. &#42; A criteria, in a short form of 1 or 2
sentences. &#42; A short paragraph explaining the impact on the
community and on the conference attendance, ideally along examples of
past issues, controversies in others communities or academics papers
&#42; Whether the criteria is a hard requirement, or a soft requirement.
A hard requirement would be harder to override than a soft requirement.
&#42; A set of resources in English from authoritative sources such as
specialized NGOs report that permit to assess the criteria at the time
of decision. It should be up to date and cover all countries if
possible, and can be complemented with more precise smaller regional
sources. Exceptions can be accepted on a case by case basis. &#42; A set
of 3/4 examples locations and how the criteria would be applied in
practice. It must provides at least one accepted and one refused
location, along the reasoning and justifications for the verdict.
Locations should be provided as examples and do not need to be related
to previous or future locations, but must use existing and contemporary
laws at the time of the proposal.

### New criteria approval {#_new_criteria_approval}

A proposal need to be reviewed and approved by the Fedora DEI team for
adequacy with the team goals, then by the Fedora Council along the input
of the Events team and any 3rd party that the Council may decide to
consult.

The Fedora DEI team must use a full consensus approval as defined in its
[decision process](dei::policy:decision-process.xml). The Fedora Council
need to follow its own Policy Change process.

If the proposal fail to obtain a consensus by any of the approving
parties, their decision must be motivated. If the proposers wish to
amend their proposal and submit it again, the new proposal must be
treated as a new proposal from the point of view of the process and
obtain approval from Fedora DEI team and Council again.

People listed as responsible for the proposal can participate to the
discussions but must refrain from casting any vote on their own
proposal. A proposal can be withdrawn or set aside at any time by the
proposers. Any substantive change to a proposal during the approval
procedure reset the process to 0.

### Fictional example of a criteria proposal {#example}

Name: Proposal for mandatory and adequate feeding of cats

Proposer: Ruby N. (rudebythecat@) and Sapphire N. (simp4ever@)

Rationale: Cats are very important and cute and important, and should be
able to come without suffering from hunger or the psychological trauma
of having water that is not fresh in their bowl.

Criteria: Flock should be in a place where cats are in charge and/or
well fed and/or treated as divinities.

Impact on the community: Without having cats in charge, they might get
underfed, and that's very very very bad. It would deter cats from
traveling to Flock, and so reduce the cuteness of the community by
reducing the feliness of the community, which is the 6th F of the 4
foundations. Cats are also good for people according to [this academic
paper](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/hai.2021.0006).

Type of requirement: Hard

Resources:

&#42;
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_by_country_or_territory>

Examples:

&#42; [Island of Aoshima,
Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoshima%2C_Ehime): Pass, because
the cats have the control of the island. &#42; [Rochester, NY,
USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York): Not pass,
because the food is hidden in a closet that is too high to reach. &#42;
[Talkeetna, AS, USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkeetna,_Alaska):
Pass, as there was a honorary cat mayor, so the cats can do a coup and
get food.

# Additional Policies {#_additional_policies}

&#42; The {team_name} will have a regular face-to-face in November each
year. The region will be dependent on the location of {team_name}
members at the time. We will also conduct in-person meetings at Flock
and DevConf.CZ for {team_name} members in attendance. &#42; Fedora
Magazine is the venue for user-targeted communication and the Community
Blog is the venue for contributor-targeted communication. &#42; The
{team_name} supports greater efficiency in the infrastructure to allow
more to be done, even when this means that we move away from self-hosted
or self-maintained infrastructure. &#42; The Fedora Project wants to
advance free and open source software and as a pragmatic matter we
recognize that some infrastructure needs may be best served by using
closed source or non-free tools today. Therefore the {team_name} is
willing to accept closed source or non-free tools in Fedora's
infrastructure where free and open source tools are not viable or not
available. &#42; Because we value participation over strict bureaucracy
(\'Friends\' foundation!) candidates for Fedora elections may be
accepted within a reasonable grace period after the deadline. However,
be aware that this may mean missing out on Fedora Magazine interviews,
town halls, and other opportunities for campaigning. &#42; The
{team_name} has no objections to events being held in the local language
or in English, and separate events can be held if there are multiple
audiences. We encourage event organizers to specify the language(s) for
their event. &#42; Unspent budget allocated to the \$150 event program
will be pulled into the {team_name} budget at the end of each fiscal
quarter. &#42; The {team_name} may choose to withdraw Fedora's support
from events or other activities that involve fiscal sponsorship or use
of Fedora trademarks when it determines that participation is not in the
interests of the Fedora Project. Decisions to withdraw support will be
published in venues normally used for {team_name} decisions.
Deliberation and reasoning for the decision should be public to the
extent possible. The {team_name} will engage with the
committee/group/team that is involved with the event in question to
ensure their input is considered.

&#42; Council Procedures

# Welcome to {team_name} {#_welcome_to_team_name}

Welcome to the {team_name}! You have just joined (or perhaps you are
thinking about joining) and now you want to learn your way around. If
you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help. Ask for a mentor
if you think that would help you.

## General expectations {#expectations}

&#42;Be brave&#42;. You are on the {team_name} because you represent the
Fedora community. We expect you to share your ideas and opinions. If you
are the representative of another group (i.e. DEI, FESCo, and Mindshare
Committee representatives), you are expected to speak on behalf of the
group you represent. Let the rest of the {team_name} know when you need
help. Share what is going well. Communicate {team_name} goings-on back
to the group you represent.

&#42;Take action&#42;. The {team_name} is an active leadership body,
which means {team_name} members should feel empowered to *do* things,
not just *discuss* things. You don't need to wait to be assigned a task.
If there's something that needs to be done, feel free to do it!

&#42;Ask for help&#42;. Every member of the {team_name} was new at some
point. Don't feel bad if you need to ask for help or if something is
unclear. Think of it as finding a bug in the documentation!

## Access

When you were elected or appointed to the {team_name}, the [Fedora
Operations Architect](foa.xml) (or someone else) opened an issue in our
[ticket tracker]({team_issue_tracker}). This provides a checklist for
all of the places you need to be granted access. Don't worry! There's
not much you need to do there. If there is something {team_name}-related
that you do not have access to, open an issue or ask in the
[&#35;council:fedoraproject.org {team_synch_communication_name}
room]({team_synch_communication}).

## Communication

The {team_name} is working on improving some of our communication
methods. We are tracking this work in
\[<https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/536> ticekt &#35;536\]
and will update our docs page with a new process once complete. In the
meantime, we try to have asynchronous conversations in the [&#35;council
tag]({team_asynch_communication}) on Fedora Discussion. This is a public
forum, so we expect---and welcome---input from community members who are
not on {team_name}. On the rare occasions when we need to discuss
confidential matters, we have a private mailing list.

For synchronous communication, we use the
[&#42;&#35;council&#42;]({team_synch_communication}) channel on
chat.fedoraproject.org. For very time sensitive or urgent confidential
matters, we might use our private chat room on chat.fedoraproject.org.
This is intended to be the exception and not the norm.

## Meetings {#meetings}

The {team_name} holds bi-weekly business meetings on
&#35;meeting:fedoraproject.org on Wednesdays. The Fedora Operations
Architect creates an agenda in advance of this meeting in our
\[<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council_Meetings> meetings wiki page\]
and posts it to discussion.fedoraproject.org under the \'&#35;council\'
tag in Project Discussion. Minutes are posted as a reply to this post
once the meeting concludes. These are an opportunity to check on the
progress of tasks and have conversations about open issues. Attendance
is not mandatory, but we encourage you to attend and participate as
often as you can. Business meetings are open to the community at large.
If the meeting time does not work for you, please propose a new time or
ask for a poll.

Once a month, we try to hold [video
meetings]({url_wiki}/Council/Video_Meetings). These are an opportunity
to let the community showcase their work and ask the {team_name} and
broader community for help. Video meetings are open to the community at
large.

From time to time, the {team_name} holds face-to-face meetings. These
are private and in-person when possible. Attendance at these meetings is
strongly encouraged. The {team_name} will pay travel expenses when
necessary.

## Tickets

Tickets are for discussing and voting on a specific proposal. If you
have an idea that needs broader discussion or brainstorming, start a
thread on Discussion.

Procedures for labels, priorities, and voting on tickets are in the
[Ticket Queue docs](procedures/tickets.xml).

# Fedora Team Directory {#_fedora_team_directory}

In order to provide visibility into what teams exist *and are active* in
Fedora, the {team_name}
[decided]({url_commblog}/fedora-council-november-2019-meeting-more-miscellaneous-stuff)
to maintain a directory that receives regular checks. {team_name}
representatives are responsible for periodic evaluation of the teams
under their area (DEI, Engineering, and Mindshare). \'Teams\' should be
read as a catch-all term for groups in Fedora that may call themselves
\'Special Interest Groups (SIGs)\', \'Working Groups (WGs)\', or any
other similar term.

## Intent

The team directory is intended to make visible:

1.  What teams are active in the community.

2.  How to contact them.

Fedora is a large community with many different activities, and the
directory will help existing and potential community members find the
team they are looking for. Having periodic checks helps to ensure that
the information is accurate and that we do not point people toward teams
that are no longer active.

The intent is *not* to increase the administrative burden on teams or
the barriers to starting a team. The intent is *not* to say \'if you are
not listed, you are not allowed to be a team in Fedora\'. However,
presence in the directory may be used by other teams to evaluate funding
or work requests (e.g. website work or design assets).

## Content

Teams should list the following information in the format specified by
the
[template](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/blob/main/f/engineering/modules/ROOT/partials/TEMPLATE_team_info.adoc):

&#42; Team name &#42; Team summary &#42; Team website &#42; Team status
(active or inactive) &#42; Team's preferred asynchronous communication
channel (e.g. mailing list, forum category, etc) &#42; Team's preferred
synchronous communication channel (e.g. IRC channel, Telegram room, etc)
&#42; Team's issue tracker &#42; Team's meeting (preferably a link to a
Fedocal event, alternatively a static day and time) &#42; Additional
information the team desires to publish in the directory

:::: note
::: title
:::

It is expected that not all teams will have answers for the above. They
should be provided when they exist.
::::

Content may be stored in the
[council-docs](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs) repo if
the team does not have its own docs repo. If a team has its own docs
repo, the content can be kept in that repo so that it can be used to
render the team's own documentation. This allows for a single source of
truth and prevents content from diverging.

## Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

Teams are responsible for ensuring their entries are up to date.

The DEI, Engineering, and Mindshare representatives to the {team_name}
are responsible for ensuring that the team that falls under their area
keeps the information up-to-date and removes teams that do not appear to
be active. They are *not* responsible for *providing* the information.
Representatives may delegate sections of their area as they see fit.
Checks can be done at any time, but should be done around the branch
date for each release at a minimum.

## Mechanism

### Team information files {#mechanism--info-files}

The directory requires a file that contains the information about the
team. The suggested naming convention is &#96;NAME_team_info.adoc&#96;,
but any valid file name is acceptable. The file may be stored in the
team's own documentation repository or in the [council-docs
repository](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/). See the
[example
template](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/blob/main/f/engineering/modules/ROOT/partials/TEMPLATE_team_info.adoc)
for format and structure.

### Rendering the directory {#mechanism-rendering}

Teams will appear in the directory if the team info file is included in
the &#96;{engineering,mindshare}/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc&#96;
directory of the [council-docs
repo](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/). After
&#96;include&#96;-ing the info file, the index page must include the
&#96;team_render.adoc&#96; file that defines the rendering.

### Reusing the data on team pages {#mechanism--reusing-data}

Teams can include their &#96;NAME_team_info.adoc&#96; file on their
page(s), and then use &#96;{team_name}&#96;, &#96;{team_summary}&#96;
etc. anywhere on the page.

# {team_name} ticket queue {#_team_name_ticket_queue}

The {team_name} uses a [ticket queue]({team_issue_tracker}) to track
decisions and other work. When opening a ticket to request a decision
from the {team_name}, please describe the issue in detail but have an
explicit question (or better, a proposal) to decide on. If you are
looking to start a discussion, consider posting to the [&#35;council tag
on Fedora Discussion]({team_asynch_communication}) first.

:::: important
::: title
:::

Do not file Code of Conduct reports in the {team_name} issue tracker.
Those should be filed against the [Code of
Conduct](https://pagure.io/CoC/issues) issue tracker.
::::

## Issue priorities {#priorities}

Currently, the {team_name} uses the following priorities for tickets:

&#42; &#42;OMG Urgent!!!1&#42;: The ticket should be acted on
asynchronously as soon as possible. &#42; &#42;Needs Review&#42;
(default): The ticket needs to be triaged. &#42; &#42;Next Meeting&#42;:
The ticket should be addressed in the next meeting. &#42; &#42;Coming
up&#42;: The ticket is lower priority. &#42; &#42;Waiting on {Assignee,
Reporter, External}&#42;: The ticket is blocked on action or input from
someone.

## Issue tags {#tags}

The {team_name} uses tags to indicate the topic of issues. Multiple tags
should be applied when appropriate.

&#42; &#42;budget&#42;: Big-picture budget issues. &#42;
&#42;code-of-conduct&#42;: &#42; &#42;documentation&#42; &#42;
&#42;elections&#42; &#42; &#42;events&#42; &#42; &#42;hackfests&#42;
&#42; &#42;mindshare&#42;: Related to the Fedora Mindshare Committee.
&#42; &#42;objectives&#42; &#42; &#42;policies&#42; &#42;
&#42;spending-request&#42;: For as-we-go allocations &#42;
&#42;ticket-vote&#42;: Indicates an issue that should be voted on by
{team_name} members. &#42; &#42;trademarks&#42;:

## Voting

When a vote is called for, the &#42;&#42;ticket-vote&#42;&#42; tag
should be applied. {team_name} members should vote by leaving a comment
of +1 (in favor), 0 (abstain/no opinion/weakly opposed), or -1
(opposed). If multiple proposals or multiple versions of a proposal have
been made, please indicate which the vote applies to. {team_name}
members can provide additional context explaining their vote, but should
still indicate explicitly which of +1, 0, or -1 applies.

Policies for voting and approval are covered
[elsewhere](index.adoc&#35;decisions).

## Promotion

### Fedora Badges {#promotion-badges}

Each year we generate a [Fedora
Badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/) that survey recipients can
claim when they submit their survey responses. A ticket needs to be
opened on the [Badges repo](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues)
requesting the badge. The panda graphic stays the same, and the year is
updated accordingly. &#42;This ticket should be opened by April 1st&#42;
in order to give the Badges team enough time to generate the artwork,
push the badge to the website, and provide a claim link to the Survey
team.

#### Past Badges {#promotion-badges-past}

&#42; 2021 &#42;&#42;
[Badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/community-survey-taker-i)
&#42;&#42; [Ticket](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/800)

### Community Blog Post {#promotion--community-blog}

Each year we need to write at least two blog posts for the survey. The
first one is to promote taking the survey, the second features the
released dataset and any findings. These are published on the
[CommBlog]({url_commblog}), make sure to follow [the
guidelines]({url_commblog}/writing-community-blog-article/). The
promotional blog post should then be pinned on Discussion.fpo for the
month the survey is open.

&#42; 2021 &#42;&#42; [Survey
Promotion]({url_commblog}/help-make-fedora-awesome-by-taking-the-first-annual-contributor-survey/)
&#42;&#42;
[Dataset]({url_commblog}/fedora-contributor-annual-survey-data-set-available/)

### Fedora Websites Banner {#promotion--websites-banner}

To help ensure we reach the maximum number of Fedora contributors, we
promote the survey across as many Fedora spaces as possible including
our websites. This work is done with the assistance of the [Design
Team]({url_wiki}/Design) and the [Websites &amp; Apps
Team](websites::index.xml).

The first step is to open a ticket on the [Design Team
pagure](https://pagure.io/design/issues) to get any updates on artwork.
&#42;This ticket should be opened by April 1st, and closed by May
1st.&#42; If there are no changes from the Design Team, proceed with the
previous design. Once the artwork is finalized, a ticket is opened on
the [Websites &amp; Apps Team](https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/issues)
repo to get it published. &#42;This ticket should be opened by May
1st&#42; and needs continuous check-ins. The websites that we aim to
cover are:

&#42;
[Hyperkitty](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/hyperkitty-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org/)
&#42; [Docs.fpo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/) &#42;
[Accounts.fpo](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/) &#42; [Fedora
Wiki]({url_wiki}/Fedora_Project_Wiki) &#42;
[Start.fpo](https://start.fedoraproject.org/)

### Mailing Lists {#promotion--mailing-lists}

A lot of folks are on multiple mailing lists so it is important to
choose high level \'announce\' channels over team channels. A short
email should be sent with a link to the Community Blog post as well as a
link directly to the survey.

&#42;
[Mindshare](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/mindshare@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[Devel-announce](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel-announce.lists.fedoraproject.org/)
&#42;
[DEI](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/diversity.lists.fedoraproject.org/)

### IRC &amp; Twitter {#promotion--irc-twitter}

For increased visibility we also promote the survey on IRC and Twitter.
This should be done sparingly as their is a potential for it to feel
spammy. It could potentially go to other social media platforms but the
main audience for that platform should be contributors not users. Don't
forget to remind people they can earn a badge!

&#42; IRC &amp; Twitter &#42;&#42; (June 1st) Announce survey is open
for month of June &#42;&#42; (June 15th) Two week reminder to fill out
survey &#42;&#42; (June 30th) One day reminder to fill out survey

## Storage and process to make changes {#changes}

&#42; Take markdown file in {team_name} repo &#42;&#42; PR's reviewed
and accepted to markdown file through out the year &#42;&#42; git diff
to locate the differences and make changes directly in the LimeSurvey UI
two weeks prior to running survey &#42; Take the lss-file of the
previous survey &#42; Upload lss-file to LimeSurvey under you personal
account &#42; Add all changes from the Markdown file as accumulated over
the year using Lime Survey interface &#42; Export lss-file and submit it
as an update to this repository &#42; Share the update lss-file with
LimeSurvey Wrangler so that new Survey is created under Fedora account.

# Fedora Governance Archived Pages {#_fedora_governance_archived_pages}

Fedora has a long history, and things have changed along the way.
Sometimes, there are policy or procedure documents that have
significance for remembering why things are the way they are and how we
got here.

This section is for those, so they can be found in one place rather than
scattered everywhere, and so they aren't accidentally lost forever in
some future infrastructure transition.

We don't want to keep *everything*, and even of text worth preserving,
this isn't necessarily the place. But if you find something that you
think is relevant to Fedora's guiding policies, overall governance, or
similar, please submit as a pull request to the [{team_name}
Docs](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs). Thank you!

# Stable Updates Vision {#_stable_updates_vision}

:::: note
::: title
:::

The \'Stable Updates Vision\' was adopted by the Fedora Board in March
2010, and is referenced in the *current* Fedora Engineering Steering
Committee [updates
policy](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/).
While some of the background factors have changed since then, the
fundamentals which informed the FESCo policy are still relevant.
::::

## Background

Discussions on March 2010 in various Fedora mailing lists have shown
that we currently have a wide variety of positions on what Fedora's
update strategy should look like. These range from a *rolling* release,
to a *locked down security-only update* solution. The lack of clarity on
this issue contributes to confusion among package maintainers and end
users alike.

Most people agree that broken updates are detrimental to the Fedora
distribution and should be avoided.

Fewer people agree on:

&#42; How many updates are acceptable for a stable release and how to
measure them. &#42; What constitutes an acceptable update to a stable
release. &#42; At what cost should broken updates be avoided, trading
off occasional broken updates for delivery speed for new software and
maintainer workflow simplicity.

For these reasons, the Fedora Board is issuing a stable release update
vision statement to help guide the creation and implementation of a
Fedora Updates policy. This policy is not meant to govern the
introduction of new packages.

By creating this statement, it is the Board's belief that:

&#42; End-user satisfaction with our distribution will increase &#42;
Developers and end-users will have a more solid stable release
experience &#42; End-users and developers will have more time to focus
on other areas in Fedora

## Factors

When creating an updates overview, there are some factors that need to
be taken into account. The first, and foremost, is keeping in mind [the
broad
criteria](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2009-October/msg00350.html)
the Board set out for the target audience of the entire Fedora
distribution, which describe someone who:

1.  is voluntarily switching to Linux

2.  is familiar with computers but is not necessarily a hacker or
    developer

3.  is likely to collaborate in some fashion when something's wrong with
    Fedora, and

4.  wants to use Fedora for general productivity, either using desktop
    applications or a Web browser.

A shifting platform and visible behavioral changes will affect the
user's productivity because the user must take time away from the
desired tasks to discover what has changed, adjust the way they perform
supporting tasks, and refocus on their original objectives. Because
productivity is postulated as important to this user, this outcome is
undesirable. Similarly, dealing with a large number of updates on a
regular basis is distracting from the user's desired productivity tasks.

Updates offered by our built-in tools under the auspices of the Fedora
Project are seen as authoritative by users. While a user fitting these
criteria is likely to file a bug when something goes wrong, the user
does not therefore automatically expect new issues to emerge in a stable
release as a result of consuming those updates. When such issues do
emerge, the user's confidence in the platform is undermined.

Another factor to keep in mind is Fedora's rapid development cycle. A
six-month development cycle for a release allows Fedora to integrate the
latest and greatest releases from upstream projects into the \'rawhide\'
distribution and have that body of work available to the user base in a
relatively short amount of time. Ideally, this rapid paced release cycle
allows both developers and users the chance to focus on a coherent,
consistent, and well functioning set of software content per release.

## Vision Statement {#vision_statement}

Taking the background and various factors above into account, the Board
believes update streams should be managed with the following purposes in
mind:

&#42; The update repositories for stable releases of the Fedora
distribution should provide our users with a consistent and high quality
stream of updates. &#42; Stable releases should provide a consistent
user experience throughout the lifecycle, and only fix bugs and security
issues. &#42; Stable releases should not be used for tracking upstream
version closely when this is likely to change the user experience beyond
fixing bugs and security issues. &#42; Close tracking of upstream should
be done in the Rawhide repo wherever possible, and we should strive to
move our patches upstream. &#42; More skilled and/or intrepid users are
encouraged to use [*Rawhide*](releases:rawhide.xml) along with
participating in testing of stable branches during the development and
pre-release period. &#42; Stable releases, pre-release branches, and
Rawhide have a graduated approach to what types of updates are expected.
For example, a pre-release branch should accept some updates which a
stable release would not, and rawhide would accept updates that are not
appropriate for either a stable release or a pre-release. &#42; Project
members should be able to transparently measure or monitor a new updates
process to objectively measure its effectiveness, and determine whether
the updates process is achieving the aforementioned vision statements.

## Implementation

Following the Fedora Board vision statement, the following policy was
approved and in effect from October 2010:

The Fedora Board was the Project's top-level governance body from July
2007 to November 2014. Before that, the \'Fedora Advisory Board\' was
merely (as the name suggests) advisory and had no formal membership.
