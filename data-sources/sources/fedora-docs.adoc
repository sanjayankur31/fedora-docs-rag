\&#42; How we work
= Documentation Team Charter

== Mission

The Fedora Documentation Team coordinates the content and tooling of the documentation at docs.fedoraproject.org with contributions from the broader community.

== Governance

=== Membership

Membership in the Docs team consists of three levels: board member, member, and contributor.
All membership levels require signing the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement.
In addition to the revocation process specified, membership may be removed or modified as a result of Code of Conduct enforcement.

==== Board member

Board membership is granted by a vote of existing board members.
A Fedora contributor requesting board membership must submit a ticket in the team's issue tracker. Existing board members vote within a week of ticket submission.
A simple majority of votes in favor will grant board member status.

Board membership does not expire. Board members are expected to step down if they expect to become inactive.
Board member status may be revoked when a board member becomes inactive or consistently makes technically or socially unacceptable actions in the team.
Removing board member status requires the vote of two-thirds of board team members voting.
At least one-third of all current board members must vote in order for the vote to count.

Board members are in the \&#42;docs-admin\&#42; group in Fedora Accounts.
This grants \&#42;owner\&#42;-level permissions in GitLab.

Board members are expected to have a recent history of regular, excellent content and/or tooling contributions and participation in meetings and team discussions.

As peer-recognized leaders of the team, board members will generally be ones to chair meetings and represent the team to other Fedora bodies (e.g. the Fedora Mindshare Committee).

==== Member

Membership is granted by a vote of existing members and board members.
A Fedora contributor requesting membership must submit a ticket in the team's issue tracker.
Existing members and board members vote within a week of ticket submission.
A simple majority of votes in favor will grant member status.

Membership does not expire.
Members are expected to step down if they expect to become inactive.
Member status may be revoked when a member becomes inactive or consistently makes technically or socially unacceptable actions in the team.
Removing member status requires the vote of two-thirds of members and board members voting.

Members are in the \&#42;docs\&#42; group in Fedora Accounts. This grants \&#42;developer\&#42;-level permissions in GitLab.

Members are expected to have a recent history of content and/or tooling contributions and participation in meetings and team discussions.

==== Contributor

Contributor status is granted to all Fedora contributors.
A contributor may make content or tooling changes by submitting merge requests or patches.
Contributors are encouraged to participate in team meetings and discussions and to provide feedback and review of other content submissions.

=== Making decisions

The team generally operates by consensus.
Formal votes are not required except when sustained disagreement exists or as otherwise required in this charter.

Except when otherwise specified, a simple majority of voting members and board members are required to change team policy, process, or practice.
Any non-trivial change should be publicly discussed for a minimum of one week before being implemented.

Votes will be open for at least one week in order to allow time for eligible voters to cast their votes.

A minimum of three votes is required.
If fewer than three votes are cast after one week, a single additional vote is sufficient to meet the quorum.

=== Meetings

The team xref:./meetings.adoc[meets regularly] to discuss and coordinate ongoing work.
Meeting chairs are selected on a volunteer basis.

Meetings are primarily for discussion.
Decision-making is left for asynchronous communication in order to be inclusive of members who cannot regularly attend meetings.
However, decisions that have been discussed in accordance with the section above may be finalized in meetings.


= Communication and Meetings

Fedora Docs currently holds weekly meetings on IRC/Telegram/Matrix.
See the link:++https://calendar.fedoraproject.org//docs/++[docs calendar] for current meeting times,
and xref:index.adoc\&#35;find-docs[the main page] for information about joining.

This page describes the structure in the meetings.

== Pre-meeting

Items to be discussed in meetings should be tagged with the link:++https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/docs/-/issues?label_name=Meeting++[Meeting] tag.
While preparing the agenda, review the https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/docs/-/boards[issue board] for items that should be tagged for the meeting.
At least a day or two prior to the meeting, the chair should post a thread with the agenda
on the link:++https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team++[forums].
Team members may suggest additional topics in these threads.

== Meeting

Follow this general script for the meeting.

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
\&#35;startmeeting docs

\&#35;topic Roll call
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

Wait 3–5 minutes to see who is present.

TIP: In case you need to step away or get disconnected, add other chairs (e.g. xref:index.adoc\&#35;_the_board[board members]) with: \&#35;chair \&lt;NICK\&gt;

List the agenda for the meeting:

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
\&#35;topic Agenda
\&#35;info Announcements
\&#35;info Review action items
\&#35;info \&lt;topic 1\&gt;
\&#35;info \&lt;topic 2\&gt;
\&#35;info …
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

Start with any important announcements.
(e.g. Release Notes that need to be written, upcoming deadlines, a link to the https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/docs/-/boards[issue board], etc.)

Next, review action items from https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/sresults/?group_id=docs\&amp;type=team[previous meetings].
Get updates when there are updates to get.
If an action item is still open,
use the \&#96;\&#35;action\&#96; command to assign it again.
This keeps chairs from having to search many previous meetings.

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
\&#35;topic Previous action items
\&#35;info \&lt;nick\&gt; was to \&lt;action\&gt;
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

Proceed through the other agenda topics.
Use \&#96;\&#35;topic\&#96; to change the topic.
Make frequent use of \&#96;\&#35;info\&#96; and \&#96;\&#35;link\&#96; commands to add context to the minutes.
If someone needs to act,
use \&#96;\&#35;action \&lt;nick\&gt; to \&lt;action\&gt;\&#96; to note it in the minutes.
Note agreements with the \&#96;\&#35;agreed\&#96; command.

TIP: Most of the time,
something that is \&#35;agreed should be recorded elsewhere after the meeting.
For example,
in the resolution of a ticket
or as a new policy/procedure in the documentation.

NOTE: Should we add a regular content-related topic?
https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/fedora-and-centos-docs-revitalization/36353/7[Peter Boy suggested this].

If time permits,
open the floor for other discussion.

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
\&#35;topic Open floor
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

CAUTION: Do not make decisions in the open floor section.
Decisions should,
at a minimum,
be made after appearing on the meeting agenda in advance.
In most cases, decisions should happen asynchronously.

When time is up or there are no more topics to discuss, end the meeting.

\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
\&#35;endmeeting
\&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

== Post-meeting

Paste the links to the minutes and logs in the Discussion thread you used for the agenda.
Note any important outcomes.
Update tickets or discussion threads with actions, agreements, etc.


= The Docs Workflow organization
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;

[abstract]
This guide presents Docs members and aspiring contributors with the list of labels and categories associated with Issues and Merge Requests in GitLab Docs repository.

The Fedora Docs team agreed on a workflow organization, which converges at the two central pages:

https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/docs/-/boards[GitLab dashboard]

https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/docs/-/merge_requests[GitLab Open Merge Requests]


== Issue board and labels

There are four labels that classify the state of an issue ticket.

\&#42; Triage:
Issue is labeled, but no one has been assigned yet. Do you want to take over? Feel free to assign yourself and shift the issue to “In progress”.
\&#42; In progress:
Someone has been assigned to this issue and it is in progress.
\&#42; Support needed:
Something was already done, but someone has to support the existing assignee or take over the assignment at all.
\&#42; Approval needed:
This is a major change and it needs an approval from someone else than the assignee. Feel free to take over the approval so that the assignee can merge afterwards.

'Open Merge Requests' do not contain a dashboard. You can see all assigned labels of an open Merge Request at first glance when opening the 'Open Merge Requests' page.

Additionally, there are three labels that classify the type of an issue ticket.

\&#42; Major change:
This is a major change within Docs page(s). It needs a Merge Request and has to be approved by someone else than the assignee before it can be merged.

\&#42; Minor change:
This is only a minor change in Docs page(s). It does not need an approval, and it can be committed directly (a Merge Request is not mandatory).

\&#42; Internal task:
This is an internal task of Fedora Docs that is not a change, fix or update of a Docs page/content. (Example: preparing a meeting or evaluating a survey).

Each issue ticket and each open Merge Request has to be labeled additionally with one of these three labels. The type labels do not change during the workflow.

Beyond a state label and a type label, issue tickets and merge requests can be additionally labeled as 'good first issue'. You want to contribute to Fedora Docs? This is your opportunity. Feel free to comment in one of these issues that you want to self-assign.

Furthermore, there is an additional label for Merge Requests that could possibly affect more than one branch, which would mean that they require follow-up Merge Requests or cherry-picks. The \&#42;multiple MR likely\&#42; label ensures that all affected branches are identified and updated, and that Merge Requests are not merged without the MR review.

== How issue tickets and Merge Requests are created

There are two ways issue tickets and Merge Requests can be created: externally and internally.

\&#42; If created externally, they are created by people from outside the Fedora Docs team, who opened them in GitLab or using the 'Report an issue' (creates issue tickets) / 'Edit this page' (creates Merge Requests) buttons on any Fedora Docs page (the buttons are on the top right). Tickets will appear in the list 'Open' on the dashboard without any labels. The Merge Requests will appear on the Open Merge Requests page without any labels.
\&#42; If created internally, one of the Docs Team opened it. At the best, this member already assigns a \&#42;type label\&#42; and puts issue tickets into the 'Triage' list, where the ticket can wait for an assignee to take over. It is the same for Merge Requests, although they do not have drag \&amp; drop lists and the 'Triage' label has to be set manually just like the type label. Alternatively, the creating member can already assign an assignee to the issue ticket / Merge Request and then put (drag \&amp; drop) an issue ticket on the 'In progress' list (this implies adding the 'In progress' label) on the dashboard, or manually add the 'In progress' label if it is a Merge Request.

On the dashboard, issue tickets can be moved along the lists with drag and drop. The state labels change acoordingly. If a ticket is moved from 'Triage' to 'In progress' by drag and drop, the state label is changed from 'Triage' to 'In progress'. Therefore, only the persistent type labels have to be set manually once when the ticket is new. This does not apply to Merge Requests on the Open Merge Request page. When creating an issue ticket on the dashboard, you will be asked where to create the issue ticket. If you are unsure where to create an issue ticket, create it in Fedora / Fedora Docs / Docs Website / Fedora Docs pages. You will see this in the 'Projects' list ('Select a project') which is shown when you click to create an issue ticket. Later, this will be shown as 'fedora/docs/docs-website/pages'.

== The workflow
=== Minor change

If conducted by Docs members, and if it is clearly a 'Minor change', a change can be done by a direct commit, without a Merge Request or issue ticket. If externals make a Merge Request as 'Minor change', Docs members merge it immediately after they assigned themselves and reviewed the Merge Request. But always check if a change applies to multiple branches.

If multiple branches are affected by a 'Minor change', you are only allowed to directly merge/commit if you do the merge/commit and the cherry-picks to all affected branches at once. If you are unsure, add the 'multiple MR likely' label additionally to the 'Minor change' label and keep the Merge Request open for discussions.

Depending on the following discussion, the 'multiple MR likely' label will be removed if there are no other affected branches and then the merge or commit can be made, or if other branches are affected, the merge or commit can be conducted and a cherry-pick to all affected branches will be done immediately and at once with the merge or commit. The goal to achieve here is that a Merge Request does not disappear from the Open Merge Request page until the update of all affected branches is complete.

If the discussion takes place within an issue ticket (using commits instead of Merge Requests, or using multiple Merge Requests that are converged within a ticket) and not within one Merge Request, the commit and the cherry-picks can be done separately.

The workflow for a \&#42;Minor change\&#42; is as follows:

. If it is only a commit which clearly is a 'Minor change', just do it. If you know what branches are affected and if you can do the commit and all related cherry-picks, go ahead. If you have not sufficient time to complete the task, proceed as follows:

. Determine the type and assign the related type label ('Minor change', 'Major change', 'Internal task'. Here: Minor change) to the existing Merge Request or the existing issue ticket, or if non is existing yet: create one! If you are unsure what to create, create an issue ticket.

. Move new issues to the 'Triage' list (which, as elaborated above, automatically assigns the 'Triage' state label), or add the 'Triage' label manually if it is a Merge Request.

. The issue ticket or the Merge Request can be assigned to a member who takes over. Once someone has been assigned, the ticket has to be moved to 'In progress' (change to 'In progress' has to be done manually for Merge Requests).

. There are a few options.
.. The assignee finishes the issue ticket/MR, and correspondingly, moves/puts it from the current state label to 'Closed'. If multiple branches are to be changed and if the case is handled within an MR, all branches need to be changed at once.
.. Alternatively, the assignee needs support, or additional opinions: the ticket/MR is just moved to 'Support needed' to identify supporter(s) (who can, but do not have to, be assigned as additional assignee(s) if that makes sense) and once sufficient supporter(s) have been identified, move/put it back to 'In progress'. Use 'Support needed' to encourage a discussion in the ticket/MR and to get additional opinions. Once all work is finished, the ticket/MR can be moved/put to 'Closed'. If multiple branches are to be changed and if the case is handled within an MR, all branches have to be changed at once. Members are free to reassign the issue (Example: if someone else has more experience with the task, or can invest more time).
.. If the assignee can no longer support the issue, the assignee either relabels the issue to 'Support needed' and finds a new assignee, or makes a comment for the work completed and remaining work, removes the assignee and changes the state to 'Triage'.

=== Major change

'Multiple MR likely' can be transferred to 'Major changes', which need an issue ticket or a Merge Request.

The workflow for a Major change is as follows:

. Determine the type and relabel Merge Request or issue ticket to \&#42;Major change\&#42;.

. Move new issues to the 'Triage' list, or add the 'Triage' label manually if it is a Merge Request.

. The issue ticket or the Merge Request can be reassigned to other members. Once someone has been assigned, the ticket moves to 'In progress' (change to 'In progress' done manually for Merge Requests).

. There are a few options.
.. The assignee finishes actively working\&#42; on the issue ticket/MR, and moves/puts it from the current state label to 'Approval needed'.
.. Alternatively, the assignee needs support, or additional opinions. The ticket/MR moved to 'Support needed' to identify supporter(s). Once sufficient supporter(s) volunteer, move the issue back to 'In progress'. 'Support needed' can also be used to encourage a discussion in the ticket/MR, to get additional opinions. Once complete, the ticket/MR can be moved to 'Approval needed'. Change the responsible assignee to someone who has more experience with the next task, or can invest more time.

If multiple branches are affected, add the 'multiple MR likely' label. If this label is assigned, the discussion within the ticket/MR has to identify all affected branches. In the end, the Merge Request has to be transferred to all affected branches through cherry-picks. If multiple branches have to be changed, all changes have to be done at once.

IMPORTANT: Do not use the 'stg' branch for content. Work in dedicated forks and branches for the specific issue you are working on.

=== Internal task

Internal tasks are flexible. They start in 'Open' or 'Triage', and move through 'Triage', 'In progress', 'Support needed' until 'Closed'.

== The role of the weekly meeting

The weekly Docs meeting helps identify and tackle issues and tasks that are not ordinary or that do not occur regularly. On the other hand, the workflow organization is set to manage the standardized day-to-day operations of Fedora Docs.

The current issue tickets and Merge Requests of the workflow organization can become regular topics on the weekly meeting.

\&#42; Check if there are any unforeseen developments in the workflow that needs a discussion.

\&#42; Identify and assign issue tickets and MR that remain unassigned for over two weeks, and discuss those that remain open one month after they have been assigned.

\&#42; Use \&#42;Meeting\&#42; label for issues or MR to be discussed in the Docs meeting.



= Contribute to Improve and Expand Docs Articles
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;

:page-aliases: contributing

[abstract]
____
This document explains how to work with the publishing system used to build the Fedora Documentation website. It will guide you through contributing to existing documentation as well as creating completely new content sets and publishing them in the English originals as well as any possible translations.
____

There are many different ways to contribute to Fedora documentation. Some of them are designed to enable contributions without technical knowledge about Web Content Management Systems and about how to store and manage your contribution. The tool takes over all these issues for you. It enables authors to concentrate on the topic at hand.

Please check us out. If you come across a documentation page that contains an error or inaccuracy, use one of the casual contribution tools described below to improve the page. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Docs team.

Local authoring tools are designed to provide a powerful working environment for accomplished authors. They enable efficient work even on large complex interrelated text collections. These tools are aimed at experienced authors.

== How it works

Fedora documentation uses Antora to build and manage the Web site. Documentation is fairly static content, with occasional updates from time to time. This is exactly what Antora specializes in. It gathers static text documents and transforms them into a complete Web site, including navigation, links, formatting, positioning, adaptation to different output devices, etc. For more general information about the Antora publishing system, see the https://antora.org/[Antora website] and https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/[Antora documentation].

As a writer, you concentrate on the content and write away.

=== The general procedure

The 4-eyes principle applies to the Fedora documentation. A different author reviews each contribution. When you complete your text or text modification, the system creates a 'Pull Request' or 'Merge Request' to integrate your text into the documentation body. This triggers other authors, board members or members committed to the part of the documentation body in question, to start a review and either initiates an inclusion or starts a discussion. Allow 2 to 3 days for an answer to a request.

=== Some technical background

Fedora uses _AsciiDoc_ to format text in a simple and efficient way. It closely follows natural writing styles in everyday notes for structuring and highlighting. In this way, you can use any editor, including almost any word processor that can edit and save AsciiDoc Text.  More about this below.

The AsciiDoc text document is stored in a series of Git repositories. This is a system especially popular among software developers, but also very capable for managing text documents. Git encourages and facilitates the use of the 4-eyes principle by a 'Pull (or Merge) Request Workflow'. You only need to worry about the details of this workflow if you want to set up a local work environment intended for professional and frequent contributions. All other tools take care of the necessary steps in the background.


== Prerequisites

The only requirements for contributing documentation to Fedora Docs are:

\&#42; link:++https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/++[\&#42;Fedora Account System\&#42;] (\&#42;FAS\&#42;) account.
\&#42; GitLab account
\&#42; Must have signed https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement] from FAS. To sign, go to your Fedora Account, select 'Settings' by clicking your profile image in the top right corner, and then select the 'Agreements' tab. Alternatively, it can be found here, substituting your actual username: https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/your-username/settings/agreements/
\&#42; Basic knowledge of \&#42;AsciiDoc\&#42; markup language (see xref:contributing-docs/asciidoc-markup.adoc[AsciiDoc for Fedora])


== The tools

=== Quick way: 'Edit' button

- Make changes to a single file for minor fixes directly from web UI of Git forge.
- Write access to upstream repo required.
- Use it as an exception (without review process), rather than a recommended option.

=== Easy way: Web IDE of Git forge

- Make changes to multiple files directly from web UI of Git forge.
- No need to install anything in local computer or run Git commands in terminal.
- Pull Requests for review process (Merge Requests in GitLab)
- You do not need special permissions or write access to the original project.

=== Flexible and advanced way: Create a local writing environment

- Work with multiple files and repos offline at your pace using your choice of text editor and terminal.
- You can build and render the pages locally to test your changes using Podman container.

== Typical ways to contribute

One can distinguish several typical types of contribution to Fedora documentation, for which the available tools are suitable in different ways.

There are many ways for various types of contribution. For example, typo fixes, adding short information or a link, update an article, write a new article.

=== Update an existing documentation page

This task involves minor changes. For example, typo fixes, adding short information or a link, or a correction to the text. This type is especially necessary whenever the documentation needs to be updated for a new software version.

The _File Edit button_ are convenient for this purpose.

=== Extend an existing documentation domain

This task involves adding one or more new chapter(s) or section(s) with several chapters. For example, adding another container technique to the documentation of containerization.

The _Web IDE_ is a convenient tool for this purpose. A local writing environment is useable as well, but may involve too much overhead if you want to contribute to just one document.

It is highly recommended to present the plan on one of the Docs communication channels before starting. You may get suggestions and tips on content, but also on editing. For example, file structure and naming conventions.

=== Introduce a new documentation area

This task involves a new extensive subject area, such as new software or a new administration tool. For example, inclusion of several sections and chapters and the creation of a new, separate repository.

For this type, setting up a local writing environment is useful and worthwhile.

In any case, a prior discussion with the Docs team is necessary, if only to create the technical prerequisites.



\&#42;\&#42; Contributing to existing documentation
= Contributing to existing documentation

This section describes how to contribute to existing documentation - that is, documentation that already has been published on the website.
Before you start following this procedure, make sure that you fulfill all the requirements listed in xref:index.adoc[Prerequisites].

[TIP]
If you are interested in contributing to Release Notes, see the xref:contributing-docs/contrib-release-notes.adoc[appropriate page].

Each Fedora Docs page includes an 'Edit this Page' link at the top.
For simple updates, changes can be submitted directly from the Pagure web interface.
For larger or more complex edits, you should prepare and test your changes offline before submitting.

== Editing online in Pagure

. Click the 'Edit this Page' link to load the documentation source.
You will be taken to the appropriate content repository in Pagure.

. Above the source listing on the right side, click 'Fork and Edit'.
(If you have already forked the repository, this button will be labeled 'Edit in your fork' and you can skip to the next step.)

.. If you are not already logged in to Pagure, you will be asked for your credentials.

.. Wait for the operation to finish.
You may need to refresh the page as it does not always update automatically when the process is done.

. Once the file is loaded in your fork, make any changes necessary to the content, commit them to your fork, and prepare a pull request (PR).

.. Each PR should be submitted from its own branch in your repository.
Under the 'Branch' heading of the commit interface, select 'New branch' and give the branch a short, unique name.

.. Fill out the commit message form.

.. Click 'Commit changes' to create the branch and save these changes to your fork.

. Once the commit is saved, the page will refresh to a list of Commits for your fork.

. To include additional, related changes, repeat this process and commit them to the same branch.

. When you are ready, click 'Create pull request' and fill out the PR form to submit your branch to the upstream repository.

[TIP]
.Git commit tips
====
\&#42; When naming your branch, use only ASCII letters, digits, hyphens (\&#96;-\&#96;) and underscores (\&#96;_\&#96;).
The name pass:q[_may_] contain, but not start or end with, single periods (\&#96;.\&#96;).
Spaces, double periods (\&#96;..\&#96;), and most other punctuation are not permitted.

\&#42; The commit title is how your edit will be identified in the repository log for the page.
The suggested title, 'Update [filename]\&#96;\&#96;pathname\&#96;\&#96;', is sufficient for small edits.
For some advice on writing good commit messages,
see link:++https://commit.style++[commit.style] by Tim Pope (author of [application]\&#96;vim\&#96;).

\&#42; Use the 'Commit Description' field to provide additional detail if necessary, but keep it short.
You will have the opportunity to explain or discuss your changes when you submit your PR.
====

== Offline editing

. Click the 'Edit this Page' link to load the documentation source.
You will be taken to the appropriate content repository in Pagure.
Once you have located the correct repository, make a fork if you do not have it forked already:

.. In the top right corner, click Fork.

.. If you are not already logged in to Pagure, you will be asked for your credentials.

.. Wait for the operation to finish.
You may need to refresh the page as it does not always update automatically when the process is done.

.. Clone your fork.

. Check out a new branch, and add your contributions.

. If you added any new files, then ensure they are included in a reasonable spot in the repository's [filename]\&#96;nav.adoc\&#96; configuration file

. Build locally and make sure everything looks the way you expect.
See xref:contributing-docs/tools-localenv-preview.adoc[Building a local preview] for instructions.

. Once you finish, commit your changes and push them to your fork.

. Use Pagure to make a pull request from your fork to the main repository's master branch.

== Managing your pull request

Someone will see your pull request and either merge it, or provide feedback if there is something you should change.
Work with the people commenting to make sure your contributions are up to standards.

[NOTE]
====
If nobody reacts to your pull request in several days, try bringing it up on one of the link:++https://calendar.fedoraproject.org//docs/++[weekly meetings], the Matrix channel (https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;docs:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;docs] on Fedora Chat), or the link:++https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team++[forums].
====

Your changes will appear online sometime after the pull request is merged.
The site is being updated daily.
If your changes do not appear online within 60 hours of your PR being merged, ping \&#96;asamalik\&#96; (Adam Šamalík) on the IRC channel and ask him about it.



= Create a new documentation module
Francois Andrieu, Fedora Documentation Team
2023-04-28

[abstract]
____
This section describes how to add a completely new piece of documentation that covers a new area in its entirety. This spans several pages and is usually associated with the creation of a new, dedicated repository. A local working environment is best suited for this. But it is also possible to use the web IDE of various GIT forges.
____

Before you start following this procedure, review all the requirements listed in xref:contributing-docs/index.adoc\&#35;_prerequisites[Prerequisites].


== Documentation repository configuration

NOTE: While you can create a new repository, or use an existing one, we recommend starting from the provided template repository if you are not familiar with Antora.

Create your new repository for the new documentation set, or ask someone to create one for you.
You can host this repository anywhere but we recommend using https://gitlab.com/fedora[GitLab] where you can use Fedora groups to control write access to the repository.
Depending on the topic, it might be preferable to host it under the https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs[Fedora Docs namespace].

On GitLab, you can use \&#96;New project\&#96; \&gt; \&#96;Create from template\&#96; \&gt; \&#96;Group\&#96; and pick \&#96;Documentation Template\&#96; in the list.

If you are not using GitLab, clone the https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/templates/fedora-docs-template[template repository] manually and copy the content to your new repository.

.Example of a simple documentation repository structure
----
📄 antora.yml
📄 site.yml
📂 modules
📂 ROOT
📄 nav.adoc
📂 pages
📄 index.adoc
📄 another-page.adoc
----

In the new repository, edit the \&#96;antora.yml\&#96; configuration file in the repository root.
The file contains comments that point out which parts you need to change.
At a minimum, always change the \&#96;name\&#96; and \&#96;title\&#96;.

NOTE: The \&#96;name\&#96; is what will define the final URL of your documentation. In example: \&#96;docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/\&lt;name\&gt;/\&#96;

Additionally, edit the \&#96;site.yml\&#96; configuration file.
Note that this file is only used when building a local preview of your content set - on the website it is overridden by the site-wide \&#96;site.yml\&#96; configuration.
The only directives you need to edit in this file are the \&#96;title\&#96; and \&#96;start_page\&#96;.

At this point, the initial configuration is complete. You can push these changes to the newly created repository (or make a pull request if you do not have the required rights) and start working on writing the actual documentation.

== Writing documentation

Some useful documentation links:

- xref:contributing-docs/asciidoc-markup.adoc[]
- xref:contributing-docs/style-guide.adoc[]

If your documentation is made of several pages, you can list them in the \&#96;nav.adoc\&#96;. This file will then be used to build the navigation menu on the left side of docs.fp-o.

While you're writing, you can use the xref:contributing-docs/tools-localenv-preview.adoc[local preview] to check the resulting document.

== Publish a new documentation module

Once the repository is set up, and initial content added, it is ready to be published.

Documentation modules published on docs.fp-o are all listed in the https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/docs-website/docs-fp-o/-/blob/prod/site.yml[main Antora playbook].

To add a new documentation module, you will need to add its repository to the \&#96;content.sources\&#96; list:

[,yaml]
----
content:
sources:
- url: https://gitlab.com/path/to/new/repository.git
branches: main \&lt;.\&gt;
start_path: docs \&lt;.\&gt;
----
\&lt;.\&gt; The default branch is set to \&#96;master\&#96;. If your repository is using any other name (\&#96;main\&#96; for instance), you need to specify it here.
\&lt;.\&gt; This setting is optional. If the documentation files are stored in a subdirectory on your repository (\&#96;/docs/\&#96; for instance), you must set its relative path here, without leading or trailing slashes. If it is located at the root level, as documented on this page, you can omit this parameter.


You can either create a Merge Request with these changes, or if you do not feel comfortable editing this file, create a ticket on the  https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/docs-website/docs-fp-o/-/issues[Fedora Docs Website repository], and the Documentation Team will handle that part for you.


[NOTE]
====
If you do not get any update to your Merge Request or ticket after 5 days, xref:ROOT:index.adoc\&#35;find-docs[get in touch with the Docs Team].

= Contributing to Quick Docs
Hanku Lee; Peter Boy; Fedora Documentation Team
:page-aliases: contributing-docs/contributions-quick-repo.adoc

[abstract]
Quick Docs is a collection of shorter how-to guide and more extensive tutorials for users of the Fedora Linux. We provide some tips and hints on contributing to Quick Docs.

== Types of content

Fedora Quick Docs consists of two types of articles.

=== How-to guides
Its characteristics are

- Intended to be useful when working with Fedora
- Problem and goal orientated
- It is usually a relatively short text no longer than 60,000 characters
- Comes usually as a step-by-step instruction to resolve a small, specific problem or task, without extensive explanation

=== Tutorials
Its characteristics are

- Intended to be useful when studying a software or a set thereof for a specific purpose in Fedora
- Characterized by learning new skills
- It is often a more extensive text longer than 80,000 characters
- Ensure comprehension of the features followed by walkthroughs of a software program

If your post does not fit into either category, consider an article under Administration Tools or on the Home page. The best place to ask is discussion.fedoraproject.org \&#35;docs.


== Who can contribute

\&#42;\&#42;Everyone\&#42;\&#42; can contribute and everyone is welcome! There are some minor and easy to meet requirements, though. The most important is a Fedora account having signed the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement]. This is essential to protect Fedora from any potential licensing issues. Of course, some knowledge of the AsciiDOC markup language is helpful, but you can get along very well without it. This is especially true when correcting and revising existing articles. One can easily get into the existing flow.

An important fact is, _no special knowledge_ is required! You don't need to know anything about desktop publishing, complicated formatting tricks or anything like that.

The range of feasible and needed contributions is wide. Everyone can contribute an important element. Typical roles/tasks are;

- writer
- technical reviewer
- spell checking
- wording improvements
- QuickDoc organization
- revision of the articles

== How to find tasks

Whether it is broken link, outdated screenshots of graphical user interface, technical and grammatical error, every little contribution, no matter how small, helps Fedora Linux users.

=== While reading an article

The greatest opportunity to contribute comes from reading an article itself. Whenever you come across an error, an omission or unclear wording, you can contribute an improvement in passing. In the header of each article are links to 2 of the 3 tools for contributions.

.Links to contributing tools
image::contrib-quickdocs/easy-contrib.png[]

The rightmost button leads to a ticket system where you can point out the problem.

.Point out blunders you found
image::contrib-quickdocs/report-issue.png[]

The subject field already contains a link to the affected document. Don't change it. Please, provide a description of the issue and if possible provide a concise suggested modification, preferably cut\&amp;paste ready.

If you are not logged to pagure, a FAS login window will open first.

The second link opens a web editor, you can use to enter proposed modifications directly in the text.

.The web editor
image::contrib-quickdocs/report-issue.png[]

The next steps are explained in detail in the article xref:contributing-docs/tools-file-edit-pagure.adoc[How to edit files on the Pagure Web UI].

=== Self-assign issues

You can find and contribute to needed changes by following the https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/quick-docs/issues[Quick Docs Issue Board], where users share blunders in the documentation or suggestions for enhancing it.

If you find issue that matches your interest and expertise, on assignee on top right, press \&#42;take\&#42; link to assign issue to yourself.

.Assign issues
image::contrib-quickdocs/assign-issues.png[]

== How to contribute

Quick Docs uses the same CMS as all other Fedora Docs, so the tools are the same. You find detailed guides in the section Contribution Tools.

=== Pull Requests and review

In either case, the workflow follows the 'pull request' or 'merge request' model. Changes are not made in the existing, published text but in a side version. When the work is complete, a 'merge request' is triggered. Members of the community will look at the changes and either start a discussion or accept the changes. They will then be merged into the published version. We thus follow the 4-eyes principle.

Pull Requests promote collaborative work flow between writers and reviewers where PR comments, edits and commits serve as review process.

The individual steps are largely automatic. Details are described in the respective tools.

=== Notification after PR

You probably want to track the further progress after the PR. That's what the Watch function is for.

Watch status in the middle of Quick Doc report has four options. Select one of the options from below.

- Watch Issues and PRs

- Watch Commits

- Watch Issues, PRs, and Commits

- Unwatch

Notification will go to your email as in user settings of Pagure.

.Notification options
image::contrib-quickdocs/watch-notification.png[]

If you do not hear from reviewers after your PR longer than a week, leave a comment in PR to follow up.


== What to pay attention to

=== Readability

- Write short sentences, structured into short paragraphs. Avoid the wall of text when creating content.

- Use clear structure and minimal formatting for better reading flow

=== Adherence to style guide

Instead of nitpicking consistency of tone and grammatical errors, reviewers encourage writers to read xref:contributing-docs/style-guide.adoc\&#35;prerequisites[The docs style guide]. If you want automated test, run vale linter locally xref:contributing-docs/tools-vale-linter.adoc\&#35;prerequisites[Check Your Documentation Using Vale].

=== Rule sets

Beyond style guide, here are a few rule sets contributors need to observe.

- The process Docs team treat bugs in documentation follows the same principle as code bugs where continuous integration, automated testing, and gradual improvements for documentation quality are adopted.

- All changes to Quick Docs must be done via Pull Requests from forked project. Quick Docs project does not support direct push to its upstream repo.

- If you fix contents about new features, releases or new content, test the application and process in a new system or freshly installed Virtual Machine with all updates applied.

- Do not use screenshot of terminal. Provide source code block of a particular language or shell commands.

- Run prose linter like vale locally before PR. Check this link:
xref:contributing-docs/tools-vale-linter.adoc\&#35;prerequisites[How to check documentation style with Vale]



== Article template

[source,asciidoc]
----
= ARTICLE_TITLE
AUTHOR_1; AUTHOR_2; AUTHOR_3
//:page-aliases: OPTIONAL

// Optional  free form useful additional information as comment


[abstract]
Mission statement of 2-3 sentences

= Contributing to Release Notes
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs\&gt;
v0.0.1, 2022-09-26

This section describes how to contribute to Fedora Release Notes.
Before you start following this procedure, make sure that you fulfill all the requirements listed in xref:./index.adoc\&#35;Prerequisites[Prerequisites].

[TIP]
The Release Notes contribution process is on a separate page because it is different from any other Fedora documentation.
If you are interested in contributing to any other docs, see the appropriate page.

//xref:contributing-docs/contributing-to-existing-docs.adoc[appropriate page].

The Release Notes are unique in that, unlike all other documentation, they are written nearly completely from scratch for each new release, while all other docs are being kept between releases, only with updates.
This means that some parts of the procedure below, such as the git branch used or the schedule, change with each new release.
Before you start writing release notes, see the link:https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs[\&#96;\&#35;docs\&#96; tag on Fedora Discussion], speficically the sidebar on the right.
You will find current information there.

== How to contribute to Fedora Release Notes

. Check the sidebar on link:https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs[Fedora Discussion], and note the provided information: Release, schedule, branch, and link to the list of relevant issues.

. Pick one or more issues from the list of open and unassigned issues for the release which you want to contribute to.

. Open each issue you picked, and click the Take button on the right to claim it.
+
[IMPORTANT]
If you claim an issue, but later find out you don’t have time to finish it, remove yourself from the issue ASAP so someone else can pick it up.

. Find information about your issue.
A lot of them have plenty of info in them already, especially in the Wiki link; if you need more, find out who is responsible for the change (also listed on the Wiki page linked in the issue), and @-mention them in the issue comments or talk to them on IRC/Matrix or via mail.
Keep in mind that it’s always better if you try to do research before you ask questions.
Note that you might not always be able to reach the owner in a reasonable time frame; in that case just do your best, if something ends up being wrong, we can always update it later.

. Write a release note about the issue. If you’re not sure what exactly a release note looks like, check out some of the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/[previous releases] for inspiration.
We don’t want any long, overly technical texts, the release notes are generally meant to highlight changes, not to tell people how to use something.

. Now the workflow diverges based on your Pagure permissions and technical skills:
+
\&#42; If you know how to use git and ASCIIDoc, write up the release note and send a pull request against the main repository. Make sure you open the pull request against the correct branch, not \&#96;main\&#96; - see first step of this procedure for info.
(The \&#96;main\&#96; branch is only used as a template for each new release, so it only contains an empty structure and some pages that do not vary between releases.)
Your contributions should go into one of the files in \&#96;modules/release-notes/pages/\&#96;, which one exactly depends on the contents of the change you’re documenting.

//Use the \&#96;build.sh\&#96; and \&#96;preview.sh\&#96; scripts in the repository root to preview your changes locally; see the link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-docs/contributing/local-preview/[docs] for specific instructions.
If you can’t see the section where you added your contributions at all, make sure that it’s included in the table of contents in \&#96;modules/release-notes/nav.adoc\&#96;.
+
\&#42; If the above sounds like gibberish to you, it’s fine. Just add a comment with your text into the issue, and someone will mark it up and add it to the final document.

Repeat the above for as many issues as you want.

//See also the xref:contributing-docs/tools-localenv-git-guide.adoc[Git for docs writers] page for more detailed information about working with Fedora Documentation git repositories.

// If you have any questions, xref:ROOT:index.adoc\&#35;find-docs[contact Docs on IRC, Matrix, or the forums].



\&#42;\&#42; Contribution Tools
= How to make casual contributions
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;
:page-pagination:

[abstract]
To make changes in Docs page hosted on GitLab, you have a built-in web editor that makes your first contribution easier than ever. Start editing documentation on GitLab Web IDE that you can launch in one click. You do not need special permissions or write access to the original project.

- There is no need to install apps or clone repos on your local computer, or run Git commands in terminal.

- There is no risk of breaking anything.

- This guide is for GitLab-hosted repo.

== How to edit document with Web IDE

=== Step 1. Select a page to edit

- Find a Docs page you want to edit.
- Navigate to the top right and locate three buttons.
- Click the middle \&#42;edit the page\&#42; button to make corrections.

NOTE: The left button forwards to the version history of the opened Docs page as a reference. The right button \&#42;report an issue\&#42; is when you report any change or update required.

|===

|===

|===
a|image::1A-changeIdentified.png[align='center',width=940,role=black-border]
|===

- Log in to your existing GitLab account
- Use the https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/-/saml/sso[SAML link] to link your account to FAS
- You will be redirected and asked for your FAS credentials if needed
- Grant permission to Fedora

Create an account if you do not have one yet (see the image below).

|===
a|image::2-GitLabSignin.png[align='center',width=940,role=black-border]
|===

NOTE: This contributor guide walks through the new Web IDE, introduced in GitLab 15.7 release. The guide also reflects a recent change about \&#42;how to update fork\&#42;.

=== Step 2. Create your project (copy)

Click the \&#42;Open in Web IDE\&#42; button. Alternatively, press . (dot) in keyboard to launch Web IDE.

|===
a|image::3-EditPage.png[align='center',width=940,role=black-border]
|===

==== Fork a project first time

Click the \&#42;Fork\&#42; button.

The \&#42;Fork\&#42; button appears only the first time you contribute to the repository of a given Docs page. If you are contributing to the Fedora project for the first time and you do not have write access for the repository you want to contribute to, you need to fork a project.

A fork is a personal copy of the repository, which you create in your namespace.

|===
a|image::4-EditFork.png[align='center',width=940,role=black-border]
|===

==== If you have forked a project before

If you have a forked project before, you will be forwarded automatically to the next step without the \&#42;Fork\&#42; button.

If you do not launch Web IDE from your fork, \&#42;edit fork in Web IDE\&#42; button will appear in lieu of the \&#42;Open in Web IDE\&#42; button. Then you will be prompted to \&#42;go to fork\&#42; and checkout to your fork.

- Go to your forked project.
- Check the status of your fork underneath Web IDE button.

If your fork shows \&#42;Up to date with the upstream repository\&#42;, go to step 3 in Web IDE.

.Fork is up to date
image::gitlab-ui/update-fork-no.png[]

If your fork is behind upstream, you will see UI text how far your fork is behind.

.Update fork
image::gitlab-ui/update-fork-yes.png[]

- Click \&#42;Update fork\&#42; button.
- The fork will display \&#42;Up to date with the upstream repository\&#42;
- \&#42;Update fork\&#42; button disappears after fork is updated

=== Step 3. Create a new branch (version)

On your forked project, create a new branch and switch to it following the steps below.

- On the status bar underneath in the lower-left corner, click the current branch name (normally main).
- From the dropdown list, select Create new branch….
- Type the branch name that is specific to a task.
- Press Enter.
- Checkout to a new branch. Click Yes to the following pop-up box.

----
Are you sure you want to checkout \&lt;branch-name\&gt;? Any unsaved changes will be lost.
----

=== Step 4. Edit and save changes

Now, make the necessary changes in Web IDE. To write with consistency, refer to xref:contributing-docs/style-guide.adoc\&#35;prerequisites[The docs style guide]

.Editor UI
image::gitlab-ui/editor.png[]

Once you've finished, select the source control button and click the file underneath \&#42;changes\&#42; below \&#42;Commit \&amp; Push\&#42; button) to view your changes.

Type a commit message and click \&#42;Commit \&amp; Push\&#42;. Click No to commit to existing branch.

=== Step 5. Create Merge Request (MR)

In the lower-right corner, you will find three options - \&#42;create MR\&#42;, \&#42;Go to project\&#42;, \&#42;Continue working\&#42;.

.Create MR button
image::gitlab-ui/commit.png[]

- Click \&#42;Create MR\&#42; to create merge request.
- Edit the title and the description of the page.
- Scroll down to the blue \&#42;Create merge request\&#42; button and click it.

NOTE: \&#42;Go to project\&#42; option is suitable when you made small commits by stage and want to squash them into one. \&#42;Continue working\&#42; is when you want to make smaller commits by sub tasks. If you select \&#42;Create MR\&#42;, the UI will navigate to merge request.

.Merge Request
image::gitlab-ui/create-mr.png[]

If merge request is successful, you will see the following result in the lower-middle of merge request.

----
Ready to merge by members who can write to the target branch.
----

=== Step 6. Review

Your request will be reviewed by Docs team. You will expect one of the following actions.

- Reviewers ask you to revise your changes

- Approve

- Reject and close MR within reason

Whatever the case it is, MR comments facilitate collaboration between contributors and reviewers. Everyone can learn from those comments and corrections.

Once your MR is approved, the process is complete.

Thanks for your contribution!


= How to use GitLab UI for more involved document maintenance
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;

[abstract]
Documentation needs maintainance as the content grows. Writers and reviewers can contribute to Docs easily and efficiently inside GitLab Web User Interface. From Web IDE, CI pipeline to collaborative review of rendered web content and approval of pages, you can work on good content and document maintenance, uninterrupted by installation and configuration. The article assumes you are already familiar with Git and continuous integration (CI).

== Document maintenance

Maintenance of documentation takes many forms.

- Technical accuracy
- Up-to-dateness
- Curation of documentation in a logical order
- Consistency in presentation
- Standard template, attributes and conventions applied throughout Docs repos
- Use of CI pipeline to automate docs quality checks

The following sections step through how to maintain and continually improve quality of Fedora Docs repos using built-in tools in GitLab.

== GitLab Web IDE

Launched as part of the GitLab 15.7 release in December 2022, the new Web IDE provides a file explorer, a text editor and source control in one place.

=== Explorer

The explorer on the left pane helps to discover the repository structure and file list in Fedora Docs. Whichever repos, standard repository structure allows contributors to navigate files and cross-reference multiple pages quickly.

.Explorer
image::gitlab-ui/explorer-intro.png[]

=== Text editor

After making changes, go to the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar and click \&#42;Changes\&#42; under the \&#42;Commit \&amp; Push\&#42; button to view a list of files you changed in side-by-side view. If you made multiple commits, \&#42;Changes\&#42; indicate an overview of changes you have.

.View a list of changed files
image::gitlab-ui/source-control.png[]

If you click \&#42;Create MR\&#42;, you will be forwarded to your fork to create merge request. \&#42;Go to project\&#42; option is suitable when you made small commits by stage and want to squash them into one.

.Write, commit, create MR
image::gitlab-ui/commit.png[]

== CI pipeline

Automated test for Docs triggers syntax validation, stylistic errors, and helps fix them before MR is merged. The goals are project-wide consistency of documentation and adherence to the style guides. Docs team introduced a syntax-aware documentation linter for a few repos where you can find vale configuration files. Some contributors write articles without a knowledge of style guides and readability. Refer to the vale linter configuration for CI in the relevant repos:

- https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/community-tools/documentation-contributors-guide/-/tree/main/.vale/styles/RedHat[Contributor Guides]

- https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/docs-website/pages/-/tree/main/.vale/styles/RedHat[Docs Home Page]

Documentation linter carries out more than 20 tests:

- To trigger a CI pipeline to scan for any errors.
- To lint the words and structure of the documentation.
- To check the validity of links.
- To check the readability and run tests for conscious language and more.

Please be aware linter helps you write better, but it does not auto correct errors.

=== Visual reviews

With review apps, a live preview of rendered page is displayed if you click the \&#42;view app\&#42; icon or \&#42;view deployment\&#42; in preview MR_number.

.Live preview using view app
image::gitlab-ui/view-app.png[]

You will be presented with Artifacts-build page with job number and a link to the rendered page hosted on GitLab. Click the link to inspect the content just like you used to run Docsbuild script in local computer.

.MR preview in deployment
image::gitlab-ui/preview.png[]

Previewing changes during MR review facilitates close collaboration to catch errors and make suggestions to improve content.

The \&#42;View app\&#42; button disappears after MR is merged.

=== Code quality report

To view result of CI linting, go to Pipelines on the left pane and click \&#42;code quality\&#42;.

.View result of CI linting
image::gitlab-ui/pipeline.png[]

Docs team will evaluate options to reflect changes systematically based on code quality report.

Thanks for your contributions.


= How to edit files on the Pagure Web UI
Hanku Lee

This section describes how to contribute to existing documentation - that is, documentation that already has been published on the website.
Before you start following this procedure, make sure that you fulfill all the requirements listed in xref:index.adoc[Prerequisites].

[TIP]
If you are interested in contributing to Release Notes, see the xref:contributing-docs/contrib-release-notes.adoc[appropriate page].

Each Fedora Docs page includes an 'Edit this Page' link at the top.
For simple updates, changes can be submitted directly from the Pagure web interface.
For larger or more complex edits, you should prepare and test your changes offline before submitting.

== Editing online in Pagure

. Click the 'Edit this Page' link to load the documentation source.
You will be taken to the appropriate content repository in Pagure.

. Above the source listing on the right side, click 'Fork and Edit'.
(If you have already forked the repository, this button will be labeled 'Edit in your fork' and you can skip to the next step.)

.. If you are not already logged in to Pagure, you will be asked for your credentials.

.. Wait for the operation to finish.
You may need to refresh the page as it does not always update automatically when the process is done.

. Once the file is loaded in your fork, make any changes necessary to the content, commit them to your fork, and prepare a pull request (PR).

.. Each PR should be submitted from its own branch in your repository.
Under the 'Branch' heading of the commit interface, select 'New branch' and give the branch a short, unique name.

.. Fill out the commit message form.

.. Click 'Commit changes' to create the branch and save these changes to your fork.

. Once the commit is saved, the page will refresh to a list of Commits for your fork.

. To include additional, related changes, repeat this process and commit them to the same branch.

. When you are ready, click 'Create pull request' and fill out the PR form to submit your branch to the upstream repository.

[TIP]
.Git commit tips
====
\&#42; When naming your branch, use only ASCII letters, digits, hyphens (\&#96;-\&#96;) and underscores (\&#96;_\&#96;).
The name pass:q[_may_] contain, but not start or end with, single periods (\&#96;.\&#96;).
Spaces, double periods (\&#96;..\&#96;), and most other punctuation are not permitted.

\&#42; The commit title is how your edit will be identified in the repository log for the page.
The suggested title, 'Update [filename]\&#96;\&#96;pathname\&#96;\&#96;', is sufficient for small edits.
For some advice on writing good commit messages,
see link:++https://commit.style++[commit.style] by Tim Pope (author of [application]\&#96;vim\&#96;).

\&#42; Use the 'Commit Description' field to provide additional detail if necessary, but keep it short.
You will have the opportunity to explain or discuss your changes when you submit your PR.
====

== Offline editing

. Click the 'Edit this Page' link to load the documentation source.
You will be taken to the appropriate content repository in Pagure.
Once you have located the correct repository, make a fork if you do not have it forked already:

.. In the top right corner, click Fork.

.. If you are not already logged in to Pagure, you will be asked for your credentials.

.. Wait for the operation to finish.
You may need to refresh the page as it does not always update automatically when the process is done.

.. Clone your fork.

. Check out a new branch, and add your contributions.

. If you added any new files, then ensure they are included in a reasonable spot in the repository's [filename]\&#96;nav.adoc\&#96; configuration file

. Build locally and make sure everything looks the way you expect.
See xref:contributing-docs/tools-localenv-preview.adoc[Building a local preview] for instructions.

. Once you finish, commit your changes and push them to your fork.

. Use Pagure to make a pull request from your fork to the main repository's master branch.

== Managing your pull request

Someone will see your pull request and either merge it, or provide feedback if there is something you should change.
Work with the people commenting to make sure your contributions are up to standards.

= How to Create and Use a Local Fedora Documentation Workflow
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;
:page-pagination:

[abstract]
In a local environment, you can create or edit your documents offline. You use a local git repository that contains a complete set of documents and tools to edit. After editing is complete, preview them in a local build of Docs pages. It is by far the most flexible way of working with Docs repositories, enabled by the extensive adaptation to individual work routines and work equipment. A local writing environment allows full access to all the resources you routinely use on your workstation and is therefore perfectly adaptable to your style of working. It is particularly suitable for the creation of a completely new set of documentation on a topic or for revision of an existing set of documentation. This article takes an example of the Fedora project repositories in GitLab, but the overall process can be translated for Pagure and GitHub projects.

== Prerequisites

1. You need to fulfill the basic requirements as specified in xref:contributing-docs/index.adoc\&#35;prerequisites[Write contributions to Docs].

2. The workflow uses command line tools in most steps of the process. Having some experience working in the Linux Terminal is therefore necessary or must be learned in parallel.

== Setting up an authoring environment

=== Preparations

1. Use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server.

2. A GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key is to sign the commits verified.

On GitLab, go to Preferences - User Settings - Add an SSH Key / a GPG Key

Git and Podman come with Fedora workstation as default. The Podman container is set up automatically.

Create a local subdirectory where the clone of Docs repo is stored

Create the main directory with mkdir DirectoryName

----
$ mkdir ~/FedoraDocs
----

=== Set up the repository

\&#42;Fork a project\&#42;

In GitLab, go to the upstream repository and select the \&#42;Fork\&#42; button at the top. Select a namespace (your GitLab ID) and a visibility level for the forked project, which creates a fork to your GitLab account.

If you don't have access to create a project, open an issue ticket in GitLab to create one for you.

\&#42;Clone the repository\&#42;

In your forked repo, select the blue \&#42;Clone\&#42; button drop-down, and then select \&#42;Clone with SSH\&#42;. Copy that link to your clipboard.

Go to your main docs directory, and clone the repo.

----
$ cd FedoraDocs
----

When cloning a repository, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument.
This creates a ContributorsGuide subdirectory and clones the repo into that directory.

----
$ git clone \&lt;GIT URL\&gt; ContributorsGuide
----

----
$ cd ContributorsGuide
----

Check the current branch, which is main or master.
----
$ git status
----

Show all branches on the remote.
----
$ git branch -v -a
----

To create a branch and switch to it,
----
$ git checkout -b \&lt;new-branch\&gt;
----

== Working on content

Open the file(s) with your choice of text editor, edit, and save.

=== Sync your fork with the upstream repository

----
$ git remote -v
----

This will show the fork in your account as the origin.

Go to the upstream repo, and select the Clone button drop-down, and copy the Clone with SSH info.

----
$ git remote add upstream \&lt;SSH URL\&gt;
----

Run the command below to show both origin and upstream.

----
$ git remote -v
----

To keep your fork in sync with upstream,

----
$ git checkout main
$ git fetch upstream
----

----
$ git pull upstream main
----
This command gets most recent commits from upstream to your local branch.

----
$ git push origin main
----

This command pushes your local commits to the main branch of the origin remote.

=== Run the scripts to preview locally

Go to the the directory where cloned repo is, and run the build scripts in terminal.

----
$ ./docsbuilder.sh
----

Preview in your browser using the address localhost:8080

=== Save your work

To see what has been going on with git add and git commit commands.

----
$ git status
----

To add changes which will be committed,

----
$ git add -A
----

Alternatively, to add all the files in the current working directory,

----
$ git add .
----

Prepare changes for upload, which will open text editor to add commit message.

----
$ git commit -s
----

The git log command displays the project history and specific changes.

----
$ git log
----

Push changes to your branch in your fork.

----
$ git push origin \&lt;branch-name\&gt;
----

=== Create merge requests

Go to your fork of the repository in GitLab.

On the left menu, click Merge Requests, and select the blue \&#42;New merge request\&#42; in the middle.

When you work in a fork, select your fork of the repository as the source branch.

In the Target branch dropdown list, select the branch from the upstream repository as the target branch.

Click Compare branches and continue.

Select Create merge request.


= Building a local preview
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;

[abstract]
A local preview is a valuable tool to test your changes when working on your local authoring environment. Run the docsbuilder script available in Fedora content repository. You can build and run the fully rendered site on your machine to preview your changes before making a pull request to the Fedora content repositories.

== When you need a local preview

When working with local authoring environment, a local preview provides versatile workflow to test how the changes will be rendered and function in your browser locally. When you make changes such as, but not limited to;

- Change links or fix broken links
- Change document to document cross references using xref
- Consolidate multiple pages into one page
- Update images or fix broken images
- Add metadata or alt text for images
- Section levels reorganized (Example: h2 to h3, h3 to h4) for readability and reading flow
- Fix inactive navigation bar
- Reorganize navigation bar
- Rewrite outdated pages
- Add AsciiDoc attributes
- Reiterate changes and tests with vale linter

you need build scripts to render the changes predictably and test them before you make a pull request.

== What the scripts do

A unified docs builder script, docsbuilder.sh, builds a local version of the site, which means the subset of the full site that resides in your local repository. In turn, the script starts a webserver and serves the site at link:http://localhost:8080/[]. Opening this link in any web browser will show you the preview, which will be available until you kill the process (kbd:[Ctrl+C] in the terminal).

Check README.md on the landing page of projects to run the script suggested to use.

=== How to test changes

Go to the the directory where cloned repo is, build, watch and preview the site by running the build scripts in terminal.

----
$ ./docsbuilder.sh
----

Pagure or other content repositories display a different builder script.

----
$ ./builder.sh
----


[NOTE]
====
To use the scripts you need [application]\&#96;Podman\&#96; installed if using Fedora Linux or [application]\&#96;Docker CE\&#96; if using macOS.
====

== Previewing multiple repositories
If your work spans content in multiple repositories,
e.g. because you xref:contributing-docs/asciidoc-markup.adoc\&#35;external-antora-link[link to another repository],
you can extend the preview by adding more repositories to \&#96;site.yml\&#96; as follows:

----
content:
sources:
- url: .
branches: HEAD
- url: https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/another-repository.git
branches: main
----

Correct entries to use can be found from
https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/docs-fp-o/blob/prod/f/site.yml[docs-fp-o site.yml].

== Using the regular Antora scripts
If you want to use the regular Antora build and preview workflow - follow the instructions on https://docs.antora.org/[Antora Documentation page].

Once you have \&#96;\&#96;Antora CLI\&#96;\&#96; and \&#96;\&#96;Antora Site Generator\&#96;\&#96; you can build and preview the pages without the container scripts.

To build the pages in the project directory run:

[source]
----
antora generate site.yml
----

This will create a new directory \&#96;\&#96;public\&#96;\&#96; which contains all the necessary files. Navigate there and run a server command. You might already have a Python simple server, in which case run:

[source]
----
python3 -m http.server
----

or if you only have Python 2 on your machine:

[source]
----
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
----

It opens a local preview at port 8000.

If you have cargo (Rust package manager), you could also install and use \&#96;\&#96;miniserve\&#96;\&#96; or any other simple server of your choice for that matter.


= Check Your Documentation Using Vale
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;
v1.1, 2024-08-30

[abstract]
Vale is a command-line tool that allows you to check your writing for grammar and stylistic errors against a set of style rules. Vale codifies your style guides into a collection of Vale-compatible YAML files and it is highly customizable. Fedora documentation uses the https://stylepedia.net/style/5.1/[Red Hat] style guide. Before creating a merge request for any documentation or documentation updates, you will need to run https://vale.sh[Vale] on your text.

==  Install Vale on your computer

You can install Vale on your computer, or use a containerized version with Podman.

To install Vale on your computer use one of the available installers for https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[Windows, macOS, and Linux].

If you are using Fedora, you can install from the \&#96;mczernek/vale\&#96; Copr repository. Be aware that Copr is not officially supported by Fedora infrastructure. Use packages at your own risk.

----
$ sudo dnf copr enable mczernek/vale \&amp;\&amp; sudo dnf install vale
----

You can use the containerized version of Vale if you don't want to install it locally.

----
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}:/docs -w /docs jdkato/vale:latest \&lt;your_file.adoc\&gt;
----

If you installed Vale locally, verify that Vale is available by using the \&#96;vale -v\&#96; command:

----
$ vale -v
vale version 2.21.2 (your version may be different depending on when you installed Vale)
----

The Red Hat style guide and the required Vale configuration files are already installed and available in the repository you forked from the main https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs[Fedora Docs] page in GitLab.

You can verify this by checking for a \&#96;.vale.ini\&#96; file in the file list of your fork in your GitLab account. You do not need to download or install any additional style files.

== Use Vale to check files or directories

To use Vale, do the following:

. Create or edit a file in your local Fedora Docs repository. See xref:contributing-docs/tools-local-authoring-env.adoc[How to create and use a local Fedora authoring environment] for instructions on how to fork, clone, and manage Git repositories on your computer.
. Run the Vale linter on the file. You can run Vale on a single file, several files, and directories.
. Make updates to the file to fix any errors, warnings, or suggestions.
. Rerun the Vale linter to verify the file passes.

When your file passes, you can commit your work and push to your fork on GitLab, and open a merge request.

=== Vale commands and output

To run Vale on a single file:

----
$ vale filename
----

To run Vale on several files:

----
$ vale filename 1 filename 2
----

To run Vale on all the files in a directory:

----
$ vale directoryname/
----

Vale will return a list of results showing the location in the file, the level of severity, a hint about how to correct the result, and what style reference flagged the result. For example:

----
11:1   suggestion  Define acronyms and             RedHat.Definitions
abbreviations (such as 'TOC')
on first occurrence if they're
likely to be unfamiliar.
15:54  error       Use 'for example' rather than   RedHat.TermsErrors
'e.g.'.
15:59  warning     Use correct American English    RedHat.Spelling
spelling. Did you really mean
'Quickdocs'?
----

If a file returns a long list of results, use:

----
$ vale --no-wrap filename
----

This will print each result on one line. This is also useful when checking many files or all the files in a directory.

Vale has three levels of results that it will list at the bottom of the output: error, warning, and suggestion.

\&#96;✖ 1 error, 3 warnings and 4 suggestions in 1 file.\&#96;

- \&#42;\&#42;error\&#42;\&#42;: This is a blocker, and you must fix any errors found in the file.
- \&#42;\&#42;warning\&#42;\&#42;: This is a not a blocker, but is something that you need to fix to conform to the Red Hat style guide.
- \&#42;\&#42;suggestion\&#42;\&#42;: This is not a blocker, but is something you must review and try to fix to conform to the Red Hat style guide.

If you want to only look for a specific result, use the \&#96;--minAlertLevel level\&#96; flag. This is useful if you have a long list of results and want to work on one specific result level at a time.

\&#96;--minAlertLevel suggestion\&#96; (shows suggestion, warning, and error)

\&#96;--minAlertLevel warning\&#96; (shows warning and error)

\&#96;--minAlertLevel error\&#96; (shows only error)

For example, to only shows results flagged with error in the file, use:

----
$ vale --no-wrap --minAlertLevel error filename
----

== How to interpret Vale results

Vale shows the results by line number and position (sometimes called a column). It also shows the style guideline that flagged the content.

For example, this error is on line 15, starting at position 54

----
15:54  error    Use 'for example' rather than 'e.g.'.        RedHat.TermsErrors
----

----
15 \&#42;\&#42; Editor in chief for specific documentation areas, e.g. Quickdocs
^ position 54
----

Verify that your text editor shows line numbers and position. Most text editors will have a way to enable this view.

Vale will usually tell you exactly what you need to do to fix the line, which in this case is to use 'for example' instead of 'e.g.'

Rerun Vale to verify that the error is now resolved. Continue running Vale to clear all errors, warnings, and suggestions.

=== How to find guidance for correcting Vale results

Every result returned by Vale shows the Red Hat style reference that flagged the word or phrase. This is at the end of the each result, in the format of \&#96;RedHat.style_name\&#96;.

These files are in a \&#96;.vale\&#96; directory at the top level of your local repository, in a \&#96;styles/RedHat\&#96; subdirectory.

All the style files point back to the reference guide maintained by Red Hat on the https://redhat-documentation.github.io/vale-at-red-hat/docs/main/reference-guide/reference-guide/[Vale for writers at Red Hat page].

You can usually find guidance there on what to change to resolve any error or warning level results.

If you want to see the contents of a specific style file, you can examine the https://github.com/redhat-documentation/vale-at-red-hat/tree/main/.vale/styles/RedHat[vale-at-red-hat] page on GitHub.

If you still have questions or need help deciding what changes to make, post a question in the Fedora Documentation room on https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;docs:fedoraproject.org[Fedora Chat].

= Fedora Documentation Style Guide
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;
2023-04-21
:page-pagination:

[abstract]
This guide provides style guidelines and preferred term usage for the Fedora Linux Documentation. Docs team created this guide to strive for correctness and consistency in documentation.

== Writing style guide

Write clearly and use shorter sentences:: The longer a user documentation is, the more difficult it is to understand. Writing with brevity (to the point) is good. Clarity is better.

Avoid passive voice:: Passive voice is the use of the object of a sentence as the subject. For example
\&#42; Active voice: The troops defeated the enemy.
\&#42; Passive voice: The enemy was defeated by the troops.

Be careful of gerunds (-ing):: They indicate passive voice. Rewrite your sentence to sound strong. For example:
\&#42; Weak, passive voice: Setting the foobar configuration option will make the application listen on all interfaces.
\&#42; Strong, active voice: Set the foobar configuration option to make the application listen on all interfaces.

Avoid unnecessary future tense:: Unless you are actually talking about future plans or publications, present tense is best.
\&#42; Unnecessary future tense: When you select Run, your program will start.
\&#42; Present tense: When you select Run, your program starts.

Avoid too much use of the verb to be in sentences:: Too much use of \&#42;is\&#42; makes your sentences weak. Try using the verb form of words you’ve shuffled off elsewhere in the sentence. Often you can simply drop words, or use the imperative (commanding or advising) form of the sentence.
\&#42; Weak: Zambone is an app used for managing your private documents on a server.
\&#42; Strong: Zambone manages your private documents on a server. Or: Use Zambone to manage your private documents on a server.
\&#42; Weak: When setting up a file server, it is important to plan the directory structure carefully.
\&#42; Strong: Plan the directory structure of the file server carefully before you set it up.

Use standard US English for spelling and other international differences:: US English is the lingua franca for the Fedora Project overall.

Have a smooth flow from general information to specific instructions:: Structure your article with abstract, bullet points and essential AsciiDoc markup.

Avoid long texts:: Verbose writing is daunting to read. Instead, organize the text using paragraphs, bullets, and numbered steps. This helps the user to quickly grasp the text and, above all, does not seem daunting. Provide a short abstract at the beginning of a longer collection of paragraphs:: Especially after second and third order headings ('h2' and 'h3', '==' and '===' in AsciiDoc), a short sentence or paragraph should follow, briefly describing the goal and/or subject of the subsequent paragraphs, bringing the message to the reader's attention and aligning the reader's expectation.

== Typographic style guide

Use capital case for title (h1) and just title:: Capitalize the article title only.
+
\&#42; Incorrect: Fedora documentation style guide
\&#42; Correct: Fedora Documentation Style Guide

Use sentence case for the post title and heading titles:: Do not capitalize words in your article title or any heading, other than proper nouns.
+
\&#42; Incorrect: Technical Notes and Processes
\&#42; Correct: Technical notes and processes

Less is more:: Use boldface only for an extremely important phrase or statement.

Use Italics for system objects mentioned in a sentence:: GUI or CLI elements like button text, menu entries, or prompts the reader find on the screen commands or package names

Use the preformatted source text for command line input or output:: Use a shell prompt ($ or \&#35;) to indicate privilege level and set the input apart from output.

[source,console]
----
$ command arg1 arg2
output line1
output line2
----

Use of admonitions:: Tips, hints, and warnings, when used in abundance, interrupt the flow of writing and reading. Use admonitions when absolutely necessary.

== Content tips

These tips are about things to do — and avoid — in what you tell users to do. Remember that thousands of readers trust Fedora Documentation to tell them how to carry out tasks. Be responsible and helpful, test your examples carefully, advocate best practices, and respect the user’s security and choice.

Test your process:: If possible, use a fresh guest virtual machine — or at least a brand-new user account. Run your process from beginning to end to ensure it works. Fix, rinse, and repeat!

Use free and open source software and officially packaged software:: The article could cover non-FOSS software to be used on Fedora, where there is no alternative FOSS software for Fedora users.

Use Fedora family distributions:: Unless your documentation article specifically targets a cross-distribution mechanism, use installations, containers, or distributions within our family (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL).

Copr software must be accompanied by a caveat:: The Copr build system is not managed by the Fedora release team and does not provide official software builds. If you cover some software from Copr, ensure there’s no official build. If not, include a statement like this: Copr is not officially supported by Fedora infrastructure. Use packages at your own risk.

Avoid exclusionary language:: These are examples of terminology to avoid in articles:
+
\&#42; blacklist/whitelist — Use allowlist/denylist instead, which is more directly descriptive of the purpose.
\&#42; master/slave — Use primary/secondary, primary/replica, active/passive, active/standby, or another similar construct.

Use the correct style for third parties:: Names of companies, projects, and technologies do not always follow the style rules of typical English words. Choose the styling used by authoritative websites when you are unsure. If authoritative sources use inconsistent style, use your best judgment. A non-exhaustive list:

\&#42; Copr instead of COPR
\&#42; NVIDIA instead of Nvidia or nVidia
\&#42; Perl instead of PERL
\&#42; Red Hat instead of Redhat or RedHat
\&#42; ThinkPad instead of Thinkpad


== Images and screenshots

Use a fresh, standard Fedora system:: Do not use your personal system or setup. It is best to make a virtual machine with a fresh Fedora variant install, and do the steps there.

Set screen resolution at a reasonable but not too high:: Desktop environment specific screen capture software produces right-sized images for the articles. If you are showing a browser window, use active window option in screen capture software. Use an option not to include window title bar.

If you are only showing an application, pop-up, or specific areas, use an option in the software to crop it for you:: If the shot requires an entire browser window, app in full size, or whole screen, choose a medium size thumbnail. Use descriptions of images prior to block image macro to explain what actions the image display. Check the next page for AsciiDoc markup.

=== Use of directory and file naming conventions

To observe naming conventions consistently, retain the original title of article, use it on a subdirectory name and title of images.

Directory path for images in Fedora repos follows ~/modules/ROOT/assets/images/\&lt;ARTICLENAME_SHORTEND\&gt;/.png

.Naming subdirectory and files
[example]
If the title on H1 heading is Finding and installing Linux applications, the file name is finding-installing-linux-apps.adoc. Create a subdirectory and place images in following paths in your cloned local repo: ~/modules/ROOT/assets/images/finding-installing-linux-apps/.png

== Processing tips

Check spelling and grammar:: Check your work before creating a Pull Request.

Check the Red Hat style guide:: Use xref:contributing-docs/tools-vale-linter.adoc[Vale] to check your work to make sure it conforms to the Red Hat Style Guide.

[[snippets]]
== Fedora Documentation snippets

When you write Fedora Documentation, some things come up frequently.
They may not be documented in general AsciiDoc documentation, like on \&#96;asciidoctor.org\&#96;. +
This section contains handy references for Fedora Documentation writers to copy and paste in their own AsciiDoc documents.

[[internal-link]]
=== Internal links

In this section, we will use the following repository structure as an example:

.Example of documentation repository structure
----
📄 antora.yml \&lt;.\&gt;
📂 modules
📂 ROOT
📂 pages
📄 index.adoc
📄 another-page.adoc
📂 sub-dir
📄 rules.adoc
📂 council
📂 pages
📄 guiding-policy.adoc
----
\&lt;.\&gt; Defines the documentation component as _test-module_ (attribute \&#96;name\&#96;)

==== Same repository

Use the local path relative to the \&#96;pages\&#96; directory in the same module.

.Link to a page at the root level
[source,adoc]
----
xref:another-page.adoc
----

.Link to a page in a subdirectory of \&#96;pages\&#96;
[source,adoc]
----
xref:sub-dir/rules.adoc
----

[[module-link]]
==== Same repository, different module

Like an internal link, but use a colon (\&#96;:\&#96;) to separate the module name.
If you are not sure if you need this, you likely don't!
Multiple modules bundled in the same repository is not currently a common scenario in Fedora Documentation.

.Example 1
[source,adoc]
----
xref:council:guiding-policy.adoc
----

[[external-antora-link]]
==== Different repository

Link to another Fedora Documentation page that exists in another repository.
Note that you \&#42;must\&#42; use the \&#96;name\&#96; field specified in the \&#96;antora.yml\&#96; file in the other repository or it will not work.
In case the target module name is \&#96;ROOT\&#96;, you can omit the name but you still need the extra colon (\&#96;:\&#96;).

.Example 1, both links are equivalent
[source,adoc]
----
xref:test-module::another-page.adoc
xref:test-module:ROOT:another-page.adoc
----

.Example 2
[source,adoc]
----
xref:test-module:council:guiding-policy.adoc
----

=== URL redirects

You can create a redirect from an old page to a new one by using the https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/page-aliases/[\&#96;page-aliases\&#96;] attribute.
The syntax is the same as for xref:\&#35;internal-link[xref links].

.Example 1. In new-page.adoc
[,adoc]
----
= Page Title
:page-aliases: old-page.adoc
----

You can also create a redirect from another module or component.

.Example 2. In new-page.adoc
[,adoc]
----
= Page Title
:page-aliases: test-module:council:removed-page.adoc
----

=== Syntax highlighting

You can add syntax highlighting to any source block by setting the source language attribute.

.Example of setting the source language attribute to a code block
------
[,yaml]
----
output:
clean: true
dir: ./public
destinations:
- provider: archive
----
------

.Example of rendered code block with such attribute
[,yaml]
----
output:
clean: true
dir: ./public
destinations:
- provider: archive
----

The list of supported languages can be found in the https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/docs-website/ui-bundle/-/blob/main/src/js/vendor/highlight.bundle.js[highlight.bundle.js in the Fedora Docs UI].

=== Datatables

You can convert a regular table to a https://datatables.net/[DataTables] using the \&#96;datatable\&#96; role attribute.
DataTables provides filtering and ordering capabilities.

.Example of defining a DataTable
[,asciidoc]
----
[.datatable]
|===
|colA | colB | colC | colD

| yyy | 123 | zzz | 28%
| bbb | 242 | aaa | 42%
| ddd | 8874 | yyy | 99%
| ccc | 9 | ttt | 2%

Additional roles can be used to add DataTables features:

- \&#96;dt-search\&#96;: add search box
- \&#96;dt-paging\&#96;: add pagination

You can also alter the styling with the help of https://datatables.net/manual/styling/classes[built-in DataTables classes], such as \&#96;display\&#96; or \&#96;compact\&#96;.

=== Tabs block

You can create a set of tabs to organize documentation content in a block.

.Example of defining a tab set
[,asciidoc]
----
[tabs]
====
Tab A:: Contents of Tab A.

Tab B::
+
Contents of Tab B.

Tab C::
+
--
Contents of Tab C.

Contains more than one block.
--
====
----

====

For more information about tabs, refer to the Asciidoctor Tabs extension at https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-tabs.

=== Table of content
A table of content is automatically generated on the right of each pages.

IMPORTANT: There is no need to add the \&#96;:toc:\&#96; attribute as it will then add a duplicate table of content to the document.

The right-sided table of content only displays title levels up to level 2 by default.
You can change this setting with the \&#96;page-toclevels\&#96; attribute.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:page-toclevels: 3
----

=== Pagination
If you have several pages that follow the same topic, you might be interested in enabling the pagination. +
Pagination allows the reader to easily navigate to next and previous pages from the navigation tree by adding navigation links at the bottom of the page.

This option is enabled by the \&#96;page-pagination\&#96; attribute.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:page-pagination:
----

You can see a live example on this page.

=== Button and Menu UI macro
To keep consistency in presenting a button, keyboard bindings, or a menu item (path), Button and Menu UI Macros communicate to the reader what actions they need to take.

IMPORTANT: Although this attribute is named experimental, the UI macros are considered a stable feature of the AsciiDoc and used in latest Quick Docs edited.

This option is enabled by the experimental attribute.

== Best practices

A few recommendation when writing a new pages, or editing an existing one.

=== Document header
All pages \&#42;\&#42;must\&#42;\&#42; start with a level 1 title.
[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
----

Optionally, you can add https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/author-line/[authors] and https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/revision-line/[review] metadata.

.Example 1 - Authors and revision information
[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
Ben Cotton; Peter Boy; Petr Bokoc
2.0, 2022-11-26: fix for F37
----

You can decide to omit the version number, if you don't need that information.

.Example 2 - Revision information without version
[,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
Francois Andrieu
2022-12-10: Added revision metadata example
----

While these metadata are optional, try to keep at least the revision date so readers know how up-to-date the page is.

= Reusable attributes
Fedora Documentation Team \&lt;https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/docs-team\&gt;
v0.0.1, 2024-06-25
// :toc:

This page explains how to use reusable metadata, or attributes, across multiple AsciiDoc documents in Fedora Documentation.


[[why]]
== Why reusable attributes?

Sometimes you may want to use the same data across many AsciiDoc documents.
Some examples are below:

\&#42; Version releases (e.g. Fedora \&#96;N\&#96;)
\&#42; URL prefixes or suffixes (e.g. \&#96;https://pagure.io/fesco/issues/\&#96;)
\&#42; Dates and time (e.g. current year, like \&#96;2020\&#96;)

For these and more use cases, \&#42;attributes\&#42; allow you to define some metadata in a single place, and reuse it in multiple places.


== Overview

There are two requirements for your Fedora Documentation project to use attributes.

. Create an attributes file
. Import attributes in your AsciiDoc file


[[attributes-file]]
== Create attributes file

First, initialize an \&#96;attributes.adoc\&#96; file for any module.
The example below shows a globally reusable attributes file in the \&#96;ROOT\&#96; module:

[source,sh]
----
.
└── ROOT
├── nav.adoc
├── pages
│   └── index.adoc
└── partials
└── attributes.adoc
----

This is an example \&#96;attributes.adoc\&#96; from the xref:dei::index.adoc[Fedora DEI Team]:

[source,adoc]
----
// This is a data store of information about the Fedora DEI team.

// Team name:

// Team summary:

// Team page URL:

// Team activity status.
// Choose from: Active, Inactive

// Preferred asynchronous communication channel

// Preferred synchronous communication channel

// Issue tracker

// Meetings

// Imported from our old attributes file.
----


[[import]]
== Import attributes

Next, import the attributes file into your AsciiDoc document.
Placing this macro on the top line will do the rest:

[source,adoc]
----
\include::ROOT:partial$attributes.adoc[]
----


[[use-attributes]]
== Use attributes in documentation

After creating an attributes file \&#42;AND\&#42; import attributes, reference the attributes in AsciiDoc documents with the following syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
{ATTRIBUTE}
----

See this example from the Fedora DEI Team:

[source,adoc]
----
\&#42;Full consensus\&#42; is required to approve new processes, make changes to
existing team policies, and tickets requiring

[abstract]
____
This document explains how to contribute to maintaining and improving the publishing system used to build the Fedora Documentation website.
____

Maintaining the Docs website is a lot of work needing skills in different areas.

Graphical design::
The graphical and functional appearance of Docs web pages require continuous adaptation to additional or changing needs. Members with expertise in web design, UI or UX development can help optimize these areas.
Git maintainers::
All documentation is stored in Git along with issues and organisational tasks. Community members with experience in managing Git repositories can help maintain and update the Docs repositories.
Workflow maintenance::
The processes for creating the web pages are automated. Members with experience in CI can contribute to maintain and improve these processes.

The relevant sections provide further information.
