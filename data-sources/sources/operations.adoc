The Fedora Project releases a new version of Fedora Linux approximately every six months and provides updated packages (maintenance) to these releases for approximately 13 months.
This allows users to "skip a release" while still being able to always have a system that is still receiving updates.

Our https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[release schedule] intentionally includes some "buffer" weeks, with early and later release targets.
Predictable release dates benefit end users planning on upgrades, downstream distros making their schedules based on our work, and of course our own developers working on getting features to users.
End users (and the press!) should plan on the release being available by the "Target date #1" milestone.

But you know that "trick" where to keep yourself from being late you set all of your clocks ahead by five minutes?
For a month or two, it works—you're on time everywhere!—but then you start to compensate because you know that extra time is built in.
We've put out Fedora Linux releases on time for the past few years, and in order to keep doing that, we need to keep seriously aiming for the early target.
That way, when we do need it, we can actually use the built in time.
Fedora contributors should plan on having the release done by the "Early target" milestone.


We say ''approximately every six months'' because like many things, releases don't always go exactly as planned.
The schedule is not strictly time-based, but a hybrid of time and quality.
The milestone releases are https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Release_validation_test_plan[tested] for compliance with the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Criteria[Fedora Release Criteria], and releases will be delayed if this is not the case.

The schedule for the release currently under development is on its https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[release schedule] page.
Beta and General Availability (final) releases happen at approximately 14:00 UTC.


Fedora development planning is handled by the xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Release Planning Process].
So-called ''Changes'' are proposed, initially reviewed, and monitored through the development process by the xref:fesco::index.adoc[Fedora Engineering Steering Committee] (FESCo) and xref:program_management::index.adoc#_fedora_program_manager[Fedora Program Manager].


Fedora uses a system involving two 'development' trees. xref:rawhide.adoc[Rawhide] is a constantly rolling development tree.
No releases are built directly from Rawhide.
Approximately 10 weeks before the planned date of a Fedora release, a tree for that release is "xref:branched.adoc[branched]" from the Rawhide tree.
At that point the Rawhide tree is moving towards the release ''after'' the new Branched release, and the pending release is stabilized in the Branched tree.

TIP: This means that development of a Fedora release is considered to begin at the time its ''predecessor'' branches from Rawhide.
For instance, development on Fedora Linux 31 began the day after Fedora Linux 30 branched from Rawhide and entered the stabilization process.

After the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc#updates-testing-activation[Bodhi activation point] , the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi[Bodhi] system is permanently active on the Branched release (all the way until it goes end of life), and requirements for updates to be marked as ''stable'' are set out in the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy].
Packages must go through the xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc#the-updates-testing-repository[''updates-testing''] repository for the release before entering its xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc#stable-is-not-a-repository[''stable''] repository, according to rules defined in the updates policy.
These rules tighten gradually from Beta through to post-GA (Final), but the basic process does not change.

For some time prior to a milestone (Beta, Final) release a https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Milestone_freezes[freeze] is in effect which prevents packages moving from ''updates-testing'' to ''stable'' except in accordance with the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_blocker_bug_process[blocker] and https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_freeze_exception_bug_process[freeze exception] bug policies.
This freeze is lifted once the milestone is finished, and so packages begin to move from ''updates-testing'' to ''stable'' as normal again, until the next milestone's freeze date.


Fedora Linux release schedules repeat ad infinitum with "early target" dates of the third Tuesday in April and October.
Significant changes to the release schedule must be approved by FESCo.
The Fedora Program Manager works with teams across the project to incorporate their activities into the overall schedule and will make updates that do not affect release milestones.



Fedora generally develops new releases over a six month period to provide a regular and predictable release schedule. The bi-annual targeted release dates are the third Tuesday of April and October, making them easy to remember and avoid significant holiday breaks.
Changes to this standard must be approved by FESCo.

A six month release schedule also follows the precedence of Red Hat Linux (precursor to Fedora).
Former Red Hat software engineer Havoc Pennington offers a https://web.archive.org/web/20240607150548/https://listman.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2006-December/002039.html[historical perspective].
GNOME started following a time based release based on the ideas and success of Red Hat Linux and other distributions following Fedora having adopted a similar release cycle.
Several other major components have started following a time-based release schedule.
While the exact release schedules vary between these components and other upstream projects, the interactions between these components and Fedora Linux makes a six month, time-based release schedule a good balance.


If ''Mass rebuild'' is not completed on time, all the subsequent milestones starting with ''Branch point'' are pushed back for one week until the ''Mass rebuild'' is completed.

If the Beta https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Go_No_Go_Meeting[Go/No-Go_Meeting] results in a "No Go" determination, rescheduling of the milestone and subsequent milestones follows these rules:

* Slip of the Beta from the Early Target to Target #1 does not affect Final Release (GA) date. The Final Release (GA) date remains on ''Early Final Target''.
* Slip of the Beta to Target #1 adds a new ''Beta Target #2''
* Slip of the Beta past Target #N (where N >= 2) adds a new ''Beta Target #(N+1)'' and also adds a new ''Final Target #N''

If the Final https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Go_No_Go_Meeting[Go/No-Go_Meeting] results in a "No Go" determination, that milestone and subsequent milestones will be pushed back by one week.

One week is added to the schedule to maintain the practice of releasing on Tuesdays.
Tuesdays are the designated release day because they are good days for news coverage and correspond to the established day we synchronize our content with the mirrors that carry our releases.
Be aware of holidays and of possible PR conflicts with the new proposed final date.

Go/No-Go Meetings receive input from representatives of xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo], https://docs.pagure.org/releng/[Release Engineering], and https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA[Quality Assurance].

We say maintained for ''approximately 13 months'' because the supported period for releases is dependent on the date the release under development goes final.
As a result, ''Release N'' is supported until four weeks after the release of ''Release N+2''.



Fedora Linux is focused on free and open source software innovations and moves quickly.
If you want a distribution that moves slower, but has a longer lifecycle, CentOS Stream or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which are downstream of Fedora might be more suitable for you.

Historically, the Fedora Project has found that supporting two releases plus Rawhide and the pre-release Branched code to be a manageable work load.


When a release reaches the point where it is no longer supported when no updates are created for it, then it is considered End of Life (EOL).
Branches for new packages in the SCM are not allowed for distribution N after the Fedora N+2 release and new builds are no longer allowed.

The tasks performed at EOL are documented in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/release_guide/sop_release_eol/[End of life SOP].

xref:eol.adoc[Information about EOL releases] is available.

Spins are alternate versions of Fedora Linux, tailored for various types of users via hand-picked application sets and other customizations.

We first offered Spins with the release of Fedora Linux 7 in May 2007.
Previously, we distinguished between Spins—variants featuring non-default desktop environments—and Labs—variants tailored for a particular use case.
While the websites still maintain this distinction, there is no practical difference.
One day, we may even get the "Solutions" moniker to catch on.



https://spins.fedoraproject.org and https://labs.fedoraproject.org have a full list of all the spins currently offered, and information about each.
For historical information, see the per-release information on the sidebar.


Teams within Fedora are responsible for curating their Spins.
The release-specific Spins listings on the sidebar have links to the maintainers for each Spin.

Each release, the Fedora Program Manager checks with each Spin maintainer to make sure they still want to keep their Spin active.
If they do not, or if there is no reply, the Spin is offered to the community for adoption.
Unmaintained Spins are dropped in order to make sure our users get the intended experience.


More information on creating spins is available in the xref:spins/creating.adoc[Creating Spins documentation].


You can.
Customized spins are merely targeted versions of Fedora Linux.
It is possible to customize plain Fedora Linux to match any official spin.
A customized spin can save you time and effort.


Custom spins let you experience a select set of Fedora software, possibly in a particular way.
For example, a desktop live CD could boot directly to a GNOME desktop, with 3D desktop effects enabled and selected backgrounds, colors and featured applications.
With further customization, a custom spin could boot directly to a movie player or launch a Web server that is ready to publish custom data.

This page describes the process for creating a new Spin or adopting an abandoned Spin.


There are a few steps you'll need to do first.
Some of these may seem obvious, but it's best to be clear.

* Create a https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Account]
* Sign the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement[Fedora Project Contributor Agreement] in the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[Accounts system]
* Sign up for the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel-announce.lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/spins.lists.fedoraproject.org/[spins] mailing lists.
You may also want to join the higher-volume https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] mailing list and any lists or https://discussion.fedoraproject.org[Discussion] categories that are relevant to your Spin.


To start a new Spin, you'll need to file a Self-Contained xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Change proposal].
Since Release Engineering will need to start building the Spin, you'll need to submit a https://pagure.io/releng[ticket with Release Engineering].
If you want the Spin to have a non-descriptive name (for example: "Fedora Llamanator" instead of "Fedora Llama Herder Spin"), file a trademark issue with the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[Fedora Council].
But before you do any of that...


In order to be successful, there are a few things you should do as you're starting the process.

* **Find helpers.**
Whether it's a single co-maintainer or a full team, having help will lighten the load.
It gives you the ability to step away when you need to.
And if you're working with someone else, you can make each other's ideas better.
* **Set your goals.**
You can make a Spin for just about any reason.
But if you don't identify the reason, you'll have a hard time building a solution for it.
Who are you trying to serve?
What problem will you solve for them?
How will you solve it?
* **Make sure a Spin is the right solution.**
Is a software group in repo a better solution?
* **Notify the Respins SIG.**
The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Respins-SIG[Respins SIG] produces updated install media post-release.
Let them know you have a new Spin coming by posting in the #fedora-respins channel or emailing https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/jbwillia/[Ben Williams].


Great!
Your proposal is approved.
Now it's time to make it happen.

* **Work with Release Engineering to build the Spin.**
See the xref:spins/maintaining.adoc[Maintaining a Spin docs] for more about this.
* **Open a ticket with the Websites & Apps team.**
You'll need to get your Spin added to the website if you want people to be able to find it.
The xref:websites::index.adoc[Websites & Apps team] can help you get ready.
* **Open a ticket with the Design team.**
At a minimum, you'll want a header image for the website.
You may also want additional art for the website, stickers, etc.
The https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues[Design team repo] is your starting point for those requests.
* **Open a ticket with Fedora Media Writer.**
Create an issue in the https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter/issues[MediaWriter repository] to add your Spin to the media creation tool.


If a Spin is abandoned and you want to take it over, it doesn't take much beyond raising your hand.
If the Program Manager has announced that the Spin is abandoned, just reply to their email.
For a Spin that has been retired, first make sure there's a good use case for bringing it back.
If there is, submit a Self-Contained xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Change proposal] as if it were a new Spin.


The contents and configuration of Spins come from kickstart files in the https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/[fedora-kickstarts] repo.
To make changes, you can submit pull requests against the appropriate file.
If you have a particularly meaningful change to make, you may want to file a xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Change proposal] in order to communicate it to the wider community (and get it into the release notes).



You may want to start watching the https://pagure.io/releng/failed-composes/issues[failed composes repo] to see when your Spin fails to compose.
Currently, you can't get per-Spin notifications, so you'll get notified for all failures.
You'll probably want to set up a mail filter for this.

If you're not sure what a failure message means or how to resolve it, ask for help on the spins or devel mailing lists, in chat, or somewhere else that seems appropriate.


Spins are not release-blocking by default.
If you want your Spin to block the release, xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo] must approve this.

In addition, we do not re-run release candidate composes for failed non-blocking deliverables.
That means if your spin fails in the release candidate compose, it will not be a part of the official release artifacts.
Most failures these days are systemic (in other words, they represent an actual problem with the Spin), so it's on Spin maintainers to watch for and resolve failures as the Go/No-Go decision approaches.


Once per release cycle, the Fedora Program Manager will check with all Spin maintainers to ensure the Spin should continue to be produced.
If you do not respond, the Program Manager will attempt to find someone to take maintainership of the Spin.
* Development Releases

"Rawhide" is the name given to the current development version of Fedora Linux.
It consists of a xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc[package repository] called "rawhide" and contains the latest build of all Fedora Linux packages updated on a daily basis.
Each day, the build system attempts to create a full set of deliverables (installation images and so on), and all that compose successfully are included in the Rawhide tree for that day.

Rawhide is sometimes called "development" or "main" (as it's the "main" branch in package git repositories).


Rawhide has the following Goals:

* To allow package maintainers to integrate the newest _usable_ versions of their packages into Fedora.
* To allow advanced users access to the newest _usable_ packages in a rolling manner.
* To allow incremental changes to packages that are either too minor or major to go to stable Fedora releases.
* To identify and fix issues with packages before they reach a stable release of Fedora.
* To allow a place where certain low-level packages (approved by FESCo), including (but not limited to) glibc and gcc, can gain real-world testing of pre-release versions.


Rawhide is targeted at advanced users, testers, and package maintainers.

As a Rawhide consumer, you should:

* Be willing to update on an almost daily basis.
Rawhide gets hundreds of updates a day, and applying those updates on a regular basis allows you to more easily isolate when a bug appeared and what package(s) are responsible.
* Be willing and able to troubleshoot problems.
From time to time there are problems with Rawhide packages, and you will need strong troubleshooting skills and the ability to gather information for bug reports.
You need a good understanding of dnf and how to downgrade packages, as well as boot time troubleshooting.
* Have time and desire to learn new interfaces and changes.
Rawhide packages stick closely to upstream projects, so interfaces and command-line options are subject to frequent changes.
* Be willing to reboot frequently to test new kernel versions and confirm functionality of the boot process.
If you can't reboot often, consider using a stable release instead.
* Be willing and able to report bugs to Bugzilla as you find them and help maintainers gather information to fix them.

If the above doesn't match you, you may wish to instead follow the xref:branched.adoc[Branched] release (depending on the point in the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[release cycle]) or use regular stable Fedora releases.


See the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Rawhide_branched_install_methods[wiki template] for instructions on installing and using Rawhide.


There are a number of ways to communicate with other Rawhide users:


Rawhide discussion is on topic and welcome in both the https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-devel[#fedora-devel] and https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-qa[#fedora-qa] IRC channels.


Rawhide discussion is on topic and welcome in both the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists.


Rawhide bugs should be reported against the _Fedora_ product, _rawhide_ version and the affected component.
Please do follow xref:quick-docs::howto-file-a-bug.adoc[best practices] when filing.
Remember that IRC and mailing lists are useful to help narrow down if some behavior is a bug or where to report it, but are themselves not bug reporting channels.
Always file bugs in http://bugzilla.redhat.com[Bugzilla].

Note that broken dependencies are mailed to maintainers for each daily Rawhide compose where a package has such broken dependencies.
Therefore, it's usually not worth filing a bug for broken dependencies unless they don't appear in the daily report, or you have a fix or improvement to suggest.


Package owners must build for Rawhide using Koji just like you would any other build; you do not go through the Bodhi process and the build becomes available almost immediately.

The Rawhide repository is composed every day starting at 05:15 UTC.
All rawhide builds in the buildsystem at that time are included in the compose attempt.
The compose process also attempts to build all the standard Fedora 'deliverables' (live and install images, ARM and Cloud disk images, container images and so on).
If any release-blocking image fails to build as part of the compose, the compose is considered to have failed.
If the compose completes successfully, the compose will be 'synced out' to the mirror system.
(A system where the sync only happens if a set of automated tests run on it passes is planned, but not yet fully implemented).

Rawhide is under `development/rawhide` on the mirrors.
You can find a local "development" mirror on the https://mirrormanager.fedoraproject.org/mirrors/Fedora/development[public mirror list]. Compose time varies depending on number of changes, but is typically between 2 and 3 hours.

Composes are done in a rawhide chroot using the 'pungi' tool called from https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/blob/main/f/nightly.sh[a script maintained by Fedora Release engineering].
If the base set of packages in Rawhide needed to compose Rawhide are broken, the daily compose may fail.

A report for each Rawhide compose is sent to to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists.
This report contains output from the repodiff tool from the previous compose as well as a broken dependency report for packages with broken dependencies.
Additionally, private email is sent to maintainers with packages containing broken dependencies.

Package maintainers should read and follow the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc#_rawhide[Rawhide updates policy] for building any packages in Rawhide.

If needed and approved by xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo], mass rebuilds are done by Release Engineering in Rawhide a month or so before the next release branches from it.
Typically these are done for a global change over all packages such as a new gcc release, or rpm package format.


*Doesn't rawhide eat babies / kill pets / burn down houses / break constantly?*

No.
Please stop telling everyone that.

*So Rawhide is very stable and we can all use it?*

No. See audience above.
There are things that break from time to time, but if you are able to downgrade or troubleshoot, such issues aren't too severe.
Most users should still stick to stable Fedora releases, but Rawhide is a viable option for enthusiasts to experiment with.

*I'm using a Stable Fedora release, but I want a newer package version that's only available in Rawhide. Can I just `dnf install` it?*

No.
Mixing releases like this is a bad idea. Better options are:

* Ask the Fedora maintainer in a bug report to update the stable version if permitted by policy.
If not, there may be a http://copr.fedoraproject.org/[Copr repository] that provides the updated version.
See the COPR page for more details.
* Obtain the src.rpm for the package you wish and try to `rpmbuild --rebuild` it (which may or may not work depending on dependencies).

*I want to run the Rawhide kernel on my stable Fedora machine. Can I do that?*

Sometimes yes.
The kernel is more self-contained than other Rawhide packages and you also can easily boot your older kernel if the Rawhide kernel goes wrong.
Download and `dnf install` the package.
However, note that Rawhide kernels often have debugging code enabled, which results in them performing noticeably worse than release kernels (they will be slower and consume more memory).

*Is Rawhide a "rolling release"?*

It depends on how you define that, but yes.

*How can I tell when the Rawhide compose for the day has finished?*

Check the reports sent to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists, or watch fedora-messaging for the `org.fedoraproject.prod.pungi.compose.status.change` topic.

*What happens during branching, does it affect my Rawhide release somehow?*

No, you're still on Rawhide and no action is required.
(This was handled differently in the past).

*How do I get out of Rawhide again? I want to switch to the Branched release or a stable release.*

Note that downgrading your system to a lower release is not supported, not tested, not a good idea, and definitely _at your own risk_.
The safest approach is to reinstall the system.
If you really want to downgrade, at least make a filesystem snapshot first (if you use the default Btrfs filesystem).

One common use case is to switch your system to Branched right after it is created (split from Rawhide).
In this case, the sooner you do it (after branching), the safer and easier it is—the difference between systems is minimal at that point.
Downgrading after a long time, or downgrading to a stable release (which is completely different from Rawhide) will be more problematic.

You can (attempt to) downgrade to Branched or a stable release using xref:quick-docs::dnf-system-upgrade.adoc[DNF system upgrade] (the same approach as for upgrades).
However, because Rawhide uses a different set of system repositories, you need to explicitly disable those during the download phase, and explicitly enable the set or repositories used on non-Rawhide systems.
So the download command would look like this (this will disable and enable the correct repositories, and if you have some additional (including third-party) repositories installed, it will keep them enabled or disabled as they are currently; replace `NN` with the target release number): `sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=NN --disablerepo='rawhide,rawhide-modular' --enablerepo='fedora,updates'`

Everything else should be unchanged, you can use the rest of the aforelinked guide to proceed.
There is a higher chance of encountering broken dependencies when downgrading, because while package dependencies must work correctly when going up in versions.
They don't need to work when going down.
In that case, you can try `--skip-broken` or removing the offending packages (if possible), otherwise you're mostly out of luck.

*As a package maintainer do I have to build rawhide packages or does the nightly compose take care of that?*

You must build for Rawhide yourself (using Koji).
The nightly compose only collects packages already built and marked with the appropriate target (rawhide) in Koji.

*Are rawhide packages signed?*

All of them are now signed.
Make sure you have gpgcheck=1 set in your repo file to take advantage of this.


* Your package management system can be of great help in diagnosing and working around issues you find. Do read up and understand:
** `dnf downgrade`
** `dnf history`
** `dnf update --skip-broken`
** `koji download-build`
* If you are using an immutable variant like Silverblue, you should make good use of the features of OSTree like:
** `rpm-ostree rollback`
** `ostree admin config-diff`
** `ostree admin pin 0`
* You should update frequently (preferably every day).
This allows you to more easily narrow down when a problem or issue appeared.
If you apply a week of Rawhide updates at once, you have many more packages to examine to narrow down issues.
* Reboot often (preferably whenever new kernels arrive).
This allows you to test the boot up process and packages related to it, as well as newer kernels.
Read and understand the Dracut troubleshooting steps.
* Follow the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists for Rawhide issues.
Try to at least skim them before doing your daily Rawhide updates.
Look for '[rawhide]' subjects or reports of issues.
Additionally, if you find a problem and are not sure what to file bugs against, you can open a discussion there.
* Rawhide kernels are often built with varying degrees of debugging code enabled, which will result in worse performance and increased resource usage. See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/KernelDebugStrategy[Kernel Debugging Strategy] for details on exactly what debugging code is enabled for which kernel builds.
You can disable SLUB debugging for those builds for which it is enabled by passing `slub_debug=-` to your kernel command line in `/etc/default/grub` (and re-generating your GRUB config, or just adding it directly).
Additionally, you can run kernels in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RawhideKernelNodebug[Rawhide Kernel Nodebug] repo that have all debugging disabled.
* If you are using a graphical desktop environment in your Rawhide install, you may wish to install several of them.
This allows you to still login and troubleshoot when your primary desktop environment is not working for some reason.
* Have rescue media handy of the current stable Fedora release for emergencies.


Red Hat Linux "Raw Hide" http://lwn.net/1998/0820/rawhide.html[announcement].

The name might come from the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide_%28song%29[song with the same name] that starts with "Rolling, rolling, rolling, ...".

At one time, Rawhide would freeze before release milestones.
This was changed with the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_Frozen_Rawhide_Proposal[No Frozen Rawhide Proposal] and Branched process which we now follow.

Branched is the name given to a version of Fedora that has "branched" from the rolling xref:rawhide.adoc[Rawhide] tree and will become the next stable Fedora release.
It consists of a http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/development/[Fedora development release tree] named after the Fedora release it will become.
It contains builds of all Fedora packages updated by maintainers with the goal of stabilizing before release and fixing any release xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Changes].
Full nightly composes are also produced each night when a Branched release exists, usually containing all images and installer trees (minus any which fail to build).


Branched has the following goals:

* To allow package maintainers to integrate their packages into Fedora for a stable release.
* To allow advanced users access to the newer packages than stable releases typically provide.
* To identify and fix issues with packages before they reach a stable release of Fedora.


Branched is targeted at advanced users, testers and package maintainers.

As a Branched consumer, you should:

* Be willing to update often.
Branched doesn't get as many updates as rawhide (and at times they are frozen), but it still gets a larger amount than a Stable release.
* Be willing and able to troubleshoot problems.
From time to time there are problems with Branched packages, and you will need strong troubleshooting skills and the ability to gather information for bug reports.
You need a good understanding of dnf and how to downgrade packages, as well as boot-time troubleshooting.
* Frequent reboots to test new kernel versions and confirm functionality of the boot process.
If you can't reboot often, consider using a stable release instead.
* Be willing and able to report bugs as you find them and help maintainers gather information to fix them.

If the above doesn't match you, you may wish to use regular stable Fedora releases.


See the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Rawhide_branched_install_methods[wiki template] for instructions on installing and using Branched.


There are a number of ways to communicate with other Branched users:


Branched discussion is on topic and welcome in both the https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-devel[#fedora-devel] and https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-qa[#fedora-qa] IRC channels.


Branched discussion is on topic and welcome in both the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists.


Branched bugs should be reported against the _Fedora_ product, and version that this branched will become and the affected component.
Please do follow xref:quick-docs::howto-file-a-bug.adoc[best practices] when filing.
Remember that IRC and mailing lists are useful to help narrow down if some behavior is a bug or where to report it, but are themselves not bug reporting channels.
Always file bugs in https://bugzilla.redhat.com[Bugzilla].

Note that broken dependencies are mailed to maintainers for each daily Branched compose where a package has such broken dependencies.
Therefore, it's usually not worth filing a bug for broken dependencies unless they don't appear in the daily report, or you have a fix or improvement to suggest.


The Branched compose runs every day starting at 09:15 UTC.
All branched package builds at that time that are marked as xref:quick-docs::repositories.adoc[_stable_] are included in the compose attempt.
If any release-blocking image fails to build as part of the compose, the compose is considered to have failed.
If the compose completes successfully, a set of automated tests intended to check its compliance with the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Basic_Release_Criteria[Basic Release Criteria] are run.
If these tests pass, the compose will be synced out to the mirror system.
Note that during https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Milestone_freezes[freezes] there will be many days where 0 packages are added to the compose.
The Branched tree is under `development/branched` on the mirrors (when it exists).
You can find a local mirror on the https://mirrormanager.fedoraproject.org/mirrors/Fedora/development[public mirror list].
Compose time varies depending on number of changes, but is typically between 2 and 3 hours.

Branched is subject to various policies during its life cycle.
For most of its existence, it is subject to the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Updates Policy] and package updates for it are gated through the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi[Bodhi] package review process.
At various points of the xref:lifecycle.adoc[Fedora Release Life Cycle], other freezes, policies and requirements come into effect, including the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Software_String_Freeze_Policy[Software String Freeze Policy], the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Milestone_freezes[freezes], and the xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc#_change_process_milestones[Change freezes].
See all the above links for more details on exactly what changes may occur in the Branched tree under what conditions at what times.

Composes are done using the 'mash' and https://pagure.io/pungi[Pungi] tools called from a script maintained by Fedora Release Engineering.
If the base set of packages needed to compose are broken, the daily compose may fail.

A report for each Branched compose is sent to to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists.
This report contains output from the https://pagure.io/compose-utils[compose-changelog] tool from the previous compose as well as a broken dependency report for packages with broken dependencies.
Additionally, private email is sent to maintainers with packages containing broken dependencies.

Package maintainers should read and follow the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc[Branched release updates policy] for building any packages in Branched.

Until the xref:fesco::Updates_Policy.adoc#updates-testing-activation[Bodhi enabling point], you cannot expect all packages in the Branched tree to be signed.
To use Branched at these times, GPG signature checking in your package management tool must be disabled.

== Questions and Answers ==

*So Branched is very stable and we can all use it?*

Not quite, though it has improved substantially in recent years.
Still, see audience above.
There are things that break from time to time, but if you are able to downgrade or troubleshoot, such issues aren't too severe, however most users should stick to stable Fedora releases.

*I'm using a stable Fedora release, but I want the newer package for foo that is only available in Branched. Can I just yum|dnf install it?*

No.
Mixing releases like this is a very bad idea. Better options are:

* Obtain the src.rpm for the package you wish and try to `mock --rebuild` it (which may or may not work depending on dependencies).
* Ask the Fedora maintainer in a bug report to update the stable version if permitted by policy.

*How can I tell when the branched compose for the day has finished?*

You can see the reports it sends to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists.
You can also watch fedora-messaging for the messages that rawhide compose has finished.


* Your package management system can be of great help in diagnosing and working around issues you find.
Do read up and understand: `dnf downgrade`, `dnf history`, `dnf upgrade`, and `koji download-build`.
* You should update frequently (preferably every day).
This allows you to more easily narrow down when a problem or issue appeared. If you apply a week of Branched updates at once, you have many more packages to examine to narrow down issues.
* Reboot often (preferably whenever new kernels arrive).
This allows you to test the boot up process and packages related to it, as well as newer kernels.
Read and understand the Dracut troubleshooting steps.
* Follow the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel] lists for Branched issues.
Try to at least skim them before doing your daily Branched updates. Look for "[branched]" or "[F<N+1>]" subjects or reports of issues.
Additionally, if you find a problem and are not sure what to file bugs against, you can open a discussion there.
* At some times, Branched kernels are made with a large amount of debugging enabled.
You can often gain a good deal of performance by passing `slub_debug=-` to your kernel boot line in `/etc/grub2.cfg`.
Additionally, you can run kernels in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RawhideKernelNodebug[Rawhide Kernel Nodebug] repo that have all debugging disabled.
* If you are using a graphical desktop environment in your Branched install, you may wish to install several of them.
This allows you to still login and troubleshoot when your primary desktop environment is not working for some reason.
* Have rescue media handy of the current stable Fedora release for emergencies.


Branched was created as part of the "No frozen Rawhide" proposals:

:release-version: 43

This is the list of release-blocking deliverables.
The goal is to provide single point of information for Fedora QA,
Release Engineering
and other teams.

* QA knows what's release blocking and they know where testing priority is
* Release Engineering knows what's going to be produced for upcoming release ahead of time
* We can avoid last minute juggling with release at Go/No-Go meeting

This list is static
and will be updated when a Change proposal that includes changing the blocking status is approved by FESCo.

NOTE: This is not an exhaustive list of Fedora deliverables
This page only lists the blocking deliverables.
Teams are encouraged to maintain a list of non-blocking deliverables for which they are responsible.

NOTE: Fedora CoreOS deliverables are not included here because they use a different compose process.

NOTE: Images starting "IoT/" below are found in the separate Fedora-IoT composes, not the main
Fedora composes.

NOTE: Maximum sizes for compressed raw disk images apply to the uncompressed size.

Prior to Fedora Linux 21, releases had code names.
This page documents the history of release names.


Name n and n+1 must share an "is-a" (not a "has-a") relationship, but n and n+2 must not share the same is-a relationship as n and n+1.
The release names we put up for vote tend to have multiple meanings so as to allow us to select a new name with a different relationship for the next release.
It is part of the fun!

The motivation for the Changes process is to raise the visibility of planned changes and make coordination and planning effort easier.
It is nearly impossible to follow all changes happening in a big project such as Fedora.
By providing a mechanism for sharing changes, it is easier for contributors to know what is coming and to ensure that we can address impacts of changes well before the release date.
Change proposals should be shared as early as possible, before the change is implemented and even in the very early state of the idea, to gather community feedback and review.

The list of accepted changes, or _change set_, is used by different teams across the project.
For example, the change set may be used to prepare external facing materials like release notes and release announcements.

Change owners are trusted _and depended upon_ to highlight all relevant changes.
Not noting important changes (whether due to oversight, different opinion of importance, or intentionally) breaks the Change process.

The Change process is an internal planning and tracking tool, and the final release is not required to reflect all proposed changes.

Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee (FESCo) has defined two Change categories:

1. Self-contained changes
2. System-wide changes

A self-contained change is a change to isolated package(s), or a general change with limited scope and impact on the rest of the distribution/project.
Examples include addition of a group of leaf packages, or a coordinated effort within a Special Interest Group (SIG) with limited impact outside the SIG's functional area.
Self-contained changes could be used for early idea state proposals for wider and complex changes.
xref:releases::spins/creating.adoc[Creating a new Solution] (e.g. a Spin/Lab) is a Self-Contained Change.

Public announcement of a new self-contained change promotes cooperation on the change, and extends its visibility.
Change owners may find help from the community or useful comments.
Based on the community review, the self-contained change can be updated to the system-wide change category, and the owner may be asked to provide more details and extend the change proposal page.

System-wide changes involve system-wide defaults, critical path components, or other changes that are not eligible as self-contained changes.
Promoting a deliverable to Edition status is a System-Wide Change by xref:council::policy/edition-promotion-policy.adoc[Council policy].

For changes that require modifications to the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Fedora Packaging Guidelines]:

* The person or group proposing the Change is responsible for providing a first draft of packaging guideline changes to the FPC.
* Ideally, this draft will be available as a pull request _before submitting the Change proposal_ so that the community and FESCo can evaluate the specific changes.

For all system-wide changes you must file an issue in https://pagure.io/releng/issues[releng pagure] to check if your change requires Release Engineering involvement.


NOTE: Release Engineering tickets are not required by default for self-contained changes, but may be necessary if the change involves, for example, adding a new output artifact.


If your Change may require trademark approval (for example, if it is a new Spin), https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[file a ticket] requesting trademark approval from the Fedora Council.

This is the general flow for change proposals:

* The owner creates their proposal by making a copy of the changes template https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EmptyTemplate.
** It is a good idea to keep the name of the wiki page as similar as possible to the name in the proposal to avoid confusion.
* The owner submits the change proposal by setting the wiki page to the *ChangeReadyForWrangler* category.
* The Change Wrangler (FOA) checks the proposed change page for formal correctness.
This includes Release Engineering, Fedora Packaging Committee, and trademark approval tickets where necessary.
* Once the change proposal is correct, the Change Wrangler (FOA) announces it on the devel-announce and creates a post on discussion.fedoraproject.org.
* The change owner must have a username on discussion.fedoraproject.org so their change may be assigned to them. This is easly done by signing in once to discourse using your FAS login credentials.
* Any team can share their views on the discussion post (preferred) and devel mailing list and escalate a proposed change to FESCo.
The change owner may be asked to provide more details or address proposed concerns.
* FESCo members are encouraged to ask questions on the discussion post ahead of the change ticket being openend.
* The Change Wrangler (FOA) files a FESCo ticket no sooner than one week after the announcement on the mailing list and discussion post.
* Change owners are subscribed to the FESCo ticket once it has been created by the Program Manager.
** Occasionally, more information is needed on some proposals, and FESCo members may use the ticket filed for clarificiation instead of waiting for the meeting.
* FESCo will then vote to approve or deny a change proposal in accordance with the xref:fesco:ROOT:index.adoc#_ticket_policy[FESCo ticket policy].
Do not implement your proposal until the FESCo vote has ended.
When the Change Wrangler (FOA) creates a tracking bug for your issue, that is your indication to proceed.
** Occasionally, FESCo assigns the change to one of the FESCo members or a trusted community member within the functional area (a _change shepherd_), who follows the detailed status of the change with FESCo and helps with processes within Fedora. For example, the change shepherd may communicate high-impact aspects of the change, or point out that a buildroot will be necessary. The shepherd follows the status of the change until final release.
* The Change Wrangler (FOA) will create Bugzilla trackers in the _Changes Tracking_ component and issues in the Release Notes repository for approved changes.
* FESCo will re-review the status of changes one week before the beta freeze following an Incomplete Changes report from the Change Wrangler (FOA).
At this time, FESCo typically decides whether to activate the contingency plan.
Any change for which FESCo can't make this decision one week before beta must include a note on its Change wiki page and tracking bug.
Changes that cannot be completed will automatically be deferred to the next release and do not require re-submission unless substantial revisions are made.

NOTE: In most cases, you should not submit code changes to Rawhide until after FESCo has voted to approve the proposal.



New change proposals may be submitted using the guidelines described elsewhere and until the appropriate change proposal submission deadline.
For a given release, this date is available in the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[release schedule] and will be announced well in advance.

NOTE: Changes do not have to be accepted by this deadline, but they must have been submitted to the Change Wrangler (FOA) by then.


* By this date, a new change must be feature complete or close enough to completion that a majority of its functionality can be tested prior the Beta release.
* If a change proposal page specifies a change will be enabled by default, it must be so by this milestone.
* Changes that are testable should have their tracking bug set to the *MODIFIED* status.

NOTE: At this point, Rawhide and the immediately-upcoming "N+1" release are already separate branches.
If development, testing, integration — and integration testing! — are not really all lined up by this point, there is no shame in re-targeting for the next (N+2) release.
Now is the time for you to bring that to FESCo.
Or, if this change is time-sensitive, but needs more resources or attention from across the community, bring that to FESCo, to the Fedora Council, and to the Fedora community at large.


* Changes must be code complete, meaning all the code required to enable the new change is finished.
* The level of code completeness is reflected as tracker bug state *ON_QA*.
The change does not have to be fully tested by this deadline.

NOTE: Code complete (100%) deadline coincides with the Beta Freeze date because that is the last date on which it can be ensured that a build will appear in a milestone release.
The idea is really that these requirements be met in the Beta release, but due to the nature of the milestone freezes, in order to ensure this is the case, the requirements must be met by the freeze date.

Approved change proposals will have Bugzilla issues created by the Change Wrangler (FOA). The following status fields should be used to reflect the status of the change:

.Bugzilla tracker statuses
|===
|BZ Status|Meaning

|ASSIGNED|Change approved by FESCo
|MODIFIED|Change is code complete enough to be testable
|ON_QA|Change is 100% code complete
|===

NOTE: Do not close tracking bugs when a change is complete. Instead, please comment on your tracking bug that this change is complete.
The Change Wrangler (FOA) will auto-close tracking bugs as part of release housekeeping.

TIP: If you know the process already, you can jump immediately to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EmptyTemplate[an empty Change Proposal form].
For help with understanding the fields, see the xref:changes_guide.adoc[change submission guidance] page.
Watch the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERoxg-VYPo[Fedora Changes policy video] for a quick introduction to the process.

To report an issue with the proposal template, file an issue in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_docs[pgm_docs repo].

The motivation for the Changes process is to raise the visibility of planned changes and make coordination and planning effort easier.
It is nearly impossible to follow all changes happening in a big project such as Fedora.
By providing a mechanism for sharing changes, it is easier for contributors to know what is coming and to ensure that we can address impacts of changes well before the release date.
Change proposals should be shared as early as possible, before the change is implemented and even in the very early state of the idea, to gather community feedback and review.

The list of accepted changes, or _change set_, is used by different teams across the project.
For example, the change set may be used to prepare external facing materials like release notes and release announcements.

Change owners are trusted _and depended upon_ to highlight all relevant changes.
Not noting important changes (whether due to oversight, different opinion of importance, or intentionally) breaks the Change process.

The Change process is an internal planning and tracking tool, and the final release is not required to reflect all proposed changes.

Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee (FESCo) has defined two Change categories:

1. Self-contained changes
2. System-wide changes

A self-contained change is a change to isolated package(s), or a general change with limited scope and impact on the rest of the distribution/project.
Examples include addition of a group of leaf packages, or a coordinated effort within a Special Interest Group (SIG) with limited impact outside the SIG's functional area.
Self-contained changes could be used for early idea state proposals for wider and complex changes.
xref:releases::spins/creating.adoc[Creating a new Solution] (e.g. a Spin/Lab) is a Self-Contained Change.

Public announcement of a new self-contained change promotes cooperation on the change, and extends its visibility.
Change owners may find help from the community or useful comments.
Based on the community review, the self-contained change can be updated to the system-wide change category, and the owner may be asked to provide more details and extend the change proposal page.

System-wide changes involve system-wide defaults, critical path components, or other changes that are not eligible as self-contained changes.
Promoting a deliverable to Edition status is a System-Wide Change by xref:council::policy/edition-promotion-policy.adoc[Council policy].

For changes that require modifications to the xref:packaging-guidelines::index.adoc[Fedora Packaging Guidelines]:

* The person or group proposing the Change is responsible for providing a first draft of packaging guideline changes to the FPC.
* Ideally, this draft will be available as a pull request _before submitting the Change proposal_ so that the community and FESCo can evaluate the specific changes.

For all system-wide changes you must file an issue in https://pagure.io/releng/issues[releng pagure] to check if your change requires Release Engineering involvement.


NOTE: Release Engineering tickets are not required by default for self-contained changes, but may be necessary if the change involves, for example, adding a new output artifact.


If your Change may require trademark approval (for example, if it is a new Spin), https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[file a ticket] requesting trademark approval from the Fedora Council.

This is the general flow for change proposals:

* The owner creates their proposal by making a copy of the changes template https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EmptyTemplate.
** It is a good idea to keep the name of the wiki page as similar as possible to the name in the proposal to avoid confusion.
* The owner submits the change proposal by setting the wiki page to the *ChangeReadyForWrangler* category.
* The Change Wrangler (FOA) checks the proposed change page for formal correctness.
This includes Release Engineering, Fedora Packaging Committee, and trademark approval tickets where necessary.
* Once the change proposal is correct, the Change Wrangler (FOA) announces it on the devel-announce and creates a post on discussion.fedoraproject.org.
* The change owner must have a username on discussion.fedoraproject.org so their change may be assigned to them. This is easly done by signing in once to discourse using your FAS login credentials.
* Any team can share their views on the discussion post (preferred) and devel mailing list and escalate a proposed change to FESCo.
The change owner may be asked to provide more details or address proposed concerns.
* FESCo members are encouraged to ask questions on the discussion post ahead of the change ticket being openend.
* The Change Wrangler (FOA) files a FESCo ticket no sooner than one week after the announcement on the mailing list and discussion post.
* Change owners are subscribed to the FESCo ticket once it has been created by the Program Manager.
** Occasionally, more information is needed on some proposals, and FESCo members may use the ticket filed for clarificiation instead of waiting for the meeting.
* FESCo will then vote to approve or deny a change proposal in accordance with the xref:fesco:ROOT:index.adoc#_ticket_policy[FESCo ticket policy].
Do not implement your proposal until the FESCo vote has ended.
When the Change Wrangler (FOA) creates a tracking bug for your issue, that is your indication to proceed.

In general, Changes are for coordination of development effort and for communication (both internally and externally).
They aren't mandates that someone else implement an idea (no matter how good that idea).
If you have improvement in mind, work to get implementers committed to the effort _before_ filing a Change proposal, rather than expecting them to show up for work once the Change is accepted.

TIP: Watch the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERoxg-VYPo[Fedora Changes policy video] for a quick introduction to the process.

In order to be considered an official change proposal accepted for the next Fedora Linux release, the change proposal must be formally documented on a separate wiki page.

TIP: Read the xref:changes_policy.adoc[policies] for self-contained changes and system-wide changes.

TIP: Pick the right category. Remember, the category can be changed to another one based on community or FESCo review!

. Create a new wiki page
.. When logged in, click the *View Source* button on the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EmptyTemplate[empty change proposal form].
.. Copy the contents
.. Change the URL to ++https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/<YourTitle>++ (changing "<YourTitle>" to a slug for your page, e.g. "ExampleChangeProposal")
.. Click "Create"
.. Paste the contents
. Fill in the required details for the selected category (see inline comments and guidance below).
. Once you're satisfied with the change proposal page, set the wiki page category to `ChangeReadyForWrangler`, _and_ set the appropriate change category (`SelfContainedChange` or `SystemWideChange`.
Both categories must be set.
. Click the *Save Changes* button

TIP: You can remove the HTML comments in the template if you choose.


WARNING: Make sure to finish your change proposal by the change proposal submission deadline!
If you do not meet this deadline, you must seek an exception from FESCo.

The Program Manager is responsible for the actual announcement of the change proposal, creating the FESCo ticket and tracking bug in Bugzilla.

The progress of development is shown in Bugzilla with defined bug states as explained in the change proposal template.
Use this tracking bug to show blockers, using the Blocks/Depends on fields (for example package reviews), update the bug description with an actual status, and modify the bug status to reflect current state.
You may be asked by the Program Manager or FESCo members to provide more detailed status (especially for system-wide changes).

A Change is considered _code complete_ when the bug state is moved to ON_QA and when there are no blocking bugs open.

NOTE: See the xref:changes_policy.adoc#_bugzilla_trackers[Bugzilla trackers] section of the Changes policy for more information on Bugzilla statuses.

NOTE: In most cases, you should not submit code changes to Rawhide until after FESCo has voted to approve the proposal.

See the xref:changes_policy.adoc#_change_process_milestones[Change Process Milestones] section of the Changes policy for information on the process milestones.

Changes which cannot be completed for the release are automatically deferred to the next release.
You do not need to re-propose the Change unless you are making substantial revisions to it.
If you need to defer a change, let the Program Manager know and they will update the wiki page and the Bugzilla tracker appropriately.


Minor modifications can be made at any time.
If you have significant modifications to make after a Change is approved, seek FESCo's approval.



This should be descriptive, but unique.
For example "glibc 2.29" is preferable to "glibc upgrade".

TIP: Make sure your page is in the `Changes` namespace (e.g. call it `Changes/glibc_2.29`)

A sentence or two summarizing what this change is and what it will do. This information is used for the overall changeset summary page for each release.
Note that motivation for the change should be in the Motivation section below, and this part should answer the question "What?" rather than "Why?".

TIP: Assume that not everyone who sees this will know what you're talking about.
Give a brief description of packages or services where it makes sense.

For change proposals to qualify as self-contained, owners of all affected packages need to be included here. Alternatively, a SIG can be listed as an owner if it owns all affected packages.

TIP: Use your Bugzilla email in the `email` field to make your Program Manager happy.

Do not edit this section except to set the target release version and update the `[[Category:*]]` tags.

Expand on the summary, if appropriate.
A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better.
If there are multiple reasonable approaches, you should indicate why you declined to use the others.

Summarize the feedback from the community and address why you chose not to accept proposed alternatives.
This section is optional for all change proposals, but is strongly suggested.
Incorporating feedback here as it is raised gives FESCo a clearer view of your proposal and leaves a good record for the future.
If you get no feedback, that is useful to note in this section as well.
This section is inspired in part by the "Rejected Ideas" section described by https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#id46[PEP-0001].

For innovative or possibly controversial ideas, consider collecting feedback before you file the change proposal.
This could be done via a post to the devel mailing list for full community feedback, or sharing with some additional people who you trust to give you candid feedback.
In the future, there will be more specific guidance about how to post pre-proposal feedback.
Either way, when you receive feedback, you should summarize it in this section.

TIP: You should fill in this section as feedback is received.
As this is optional the Program Manager does not need to wait for you to complete this section before submitting to FESCo.
If the discussion gets heated, consider asking a neutral party to summarize the discussions for you.
This helps avoid bias and emotional response.


What is the benefit to the distribution?
Will the software we generate be improved?
How will the process of creating Fedora Linux releases be improved?

Be sure to include the following areas if relevant:

* If this is a major capability update, what has changed?
For example: This change introduces Python 5 that runs without the Global Interpreter Lock and is fully multithreaded.
* If this is a new functionality, what capabilities does it bring?
For example: This change allows package upgrades to be performed automatically and rolled-back at will.
* Does this improve some specific package or set of packages?
For example: This change modifies a package to use a different language stack that reduces install size by removing dependencies.
* Does this improve specific Spins or Editions?
For example: This change modifies the default install of Fedora Workstation to be more in line with the base install of Fedora Server.
* Does this make the distribution more efficient?
For example: This change replaces thousands of individual %post scriptlets in packages with one script that runs at the end.
* Is this an improvement to maintainer processes?
For example: Gating Fedora packages on automatic QA tests will make rawhide more stable and allow changes to be implemented more smoothly.
* Is this an improvement targeted at specific contributors?
For example: Ensuring that a minimal set of tools required for contribution to Fedora are installed by default eases the onboarding of new contributors.

TIP: When a Change has multiple benefits, it's better to list them all.


* Proposal owners: What work do the feature owners have to accomplish to complete the feature in time for release?  Is it a large change affecting many parts of the distribution or is it a very isolated change? What are those changes?
* Other developers: *REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES* What work do other developers have to accomplish to complete the feature in time for release?
Is it a large change affecting many parts of the distribution or is it a very isolated change?
What are those changes?
* Release engineering: *REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES* Does this feature require coordination with release engineering (e.g. changes to installer image generation or update package delivery)?
Is a mass rebuild required?
Include a link to the releng issue.
The issue is required to be filed prior to feature submission, to ensure that someone is on board to do any process development work and testing, and that all changes make it into the pipeline; a bullet point in a change is not sufficient communication.
* Policies and guidelines: Do the packaging guidelines or other documents need to be updated for this feature?
If so, does it need to happen before or after the implementation is done?
If a FPC ticket exists, add a link here.
Where possible, file a pull request against the appropriate policy documents _before submitting the change proposal_.
That way, the community and FESCo can evaluate the specific changes required.
* Trademark approval: If your Change may require trademark approval (for example, if it is a new Spin), file a https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[Fedora Council ticket] requesting trademark approval.
* Alignment with Objectives: Does your proposal align with the xref:project::objectives.adoc[current Fedora Objectives]? This will not apply to many Changes, but it's important to consider when proposing a Change.
Being out of alignment isn't an automatic rejection, it's just one more aspect to consider.

*REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES*
What happens to systems that have had a previous versions of Fedora Linux installed and are updated to the version containing this change? Will anything require manual configuration or data migration?
Will any existing functionality be no longer supported?

*REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES*
This does not need to be a full-fledged document.
Describe the dimensions of tests that this change implementation is expected to pass when it is done.
If it needs to be tested with different hardware or software configurations, indicate them.
The more specific you can be, the better the community testing can be.

Remember that you are writing this how to for interested testers to use to check out your change implementation - documenting what you do for testing is OK, but it's much better to document what *I* can do to test your change.

A good "how to test" should answer these four questions:

. What special hardware / data / etc. is needed (if any)?
. How do I prepare my system to test this change? What packages need to be installed, config files edited, etc.?
. What specific actions do I perform to check that the change is working like it's supposed to?
. What are the expected results of those actions?


If this change proposal is noticeable by users, how will their experiences change as a result?

This section partially overlaps with the Benefit to Fedora section above.
This section should be primarily about the User Experience, written in a way that does not assume deep technical knowledge.
More detailed technical description should be left for the Benefit to Fedora section.

Describe what Users will see or notice, for example:

* Packages are compressed more efficiently, making downloads and upgrades faster by 10%.
* Kerberos tickets can be renewed automatically. Users will now have to authenticate less and become more productive. Credential management improvements mean a user can start their work day with a single sign on and not have to pause for reauthentication during their entire day.
* LibreOffice is one of the most commonly installed applications on Fedora Linux and it is now available by default to help users "hit the ground running".
* Green has been scientifically proven to be the most relaxing color. The move to a default background color of green with green text will result in Fedora Linux users being the most relaxed users of any operating system.

*REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES*
What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?
Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this change depends?
In other words, completion of another change owned by someone else and might cause you to not be able to finish on time or that you would need to coordinate?
Other upstream projects like the kernel (if this is not a kernel change)?

*REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES*
If you cannot complete your feature by the final development freeze, what is the backup plan?
This might be as simple as "Revert the shipped configuration".
Or it might not (e.g. rebuilding a number of dependent packages).
If your feature is not completed in time, we want to assure others that other parts of Fedora will not be in jeopardy.

A contingency plan should include:

* Contingency mechanism: (What to do?  Who will do it?)
* Contingency deadline: When is the last time the contingency mechanism can be put in place?

TIP: The contingency deadline will most likely be the beta freeze.
In some cases, it may be more appropriate to set it to the start of the mass rebuild or branch day.
Rarely, you can use final freeze, but this should only be used for Changes that are trivially-revertable.

*REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES*
Is there upstream documentation on this change, or notes you have written yourself?
Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved.

The Fedora Linux Release Notes inform end-users about what is new in the release.
Examples of xref:release-notes::index.adoc[past release notes] are on Fedora Docs.
The release notes also help users know how to deal with platform changes such as ABIs/APIs, configuration or data file formats, or upgrade concerns.
If there are any such changes involved in this change, indicate them here.
A link to upstream documentation will often satisfy this need.
This information forms the basis of the release notes edited by the documentation team and shipped with the release.

In general, Changes are for coordination of development effort and for communication (both internally and externally).
They aren't mandates that someone else implement an idea (no matter how good that idea).
If you have improvement in mind, work to get implementers committed to the effort _before_ filing a Change proposal, rather than expecting them to show up for work once the Change is accepted.

TIP: Watch the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERoxg-VYPo[Fedora Changes policy video] for a quick introduction to the process.

In order to be considered an official change proposal accepted for the next Fedora Linux release, the change proposal must be formally documented on a separate wiki page.

TIP: Read the xref:changes_policy.adoc[policies] for self-contained changes and system-wide changes.

TIP: Pick the right category. Remember, the category can be changed to another one based on community or FESCo review!

. Create a new wiki page
.. When logged in, click the *View Source* button on the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EmptyTemplate[empty change proposal form].
.. Copy the contents
.. Change the URL to ++https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/<YourTitle>++ (changing "<YourTitle>" to a slug for your page, e.g. "ExampleChangeProposal")
.. Click "Create"
.. Paste the contents
. Fill in the required details for the selected category (see inline comments and guidance below).
. Once you're satisfied with the change proposal page, set the wiki page category to `ChangeReadyForWrangler`, _and_ set the appropriate change category (`SelfContainedChange` or `SystemWideChange`.
Both categories must be set.
. Click the *Save Changes* button

TIP: You can remove the HTML comments in the template if you choose.


WARNING: Make sure to finish your change proposal by the change proposal submission deadline!
If you do not meet this deadline, you must seek an exception from FESCo.

The Program Manager is responsible for the actual announcement of the change proposal, creating the FESCo ticket and tracking bug in Bugzilla.

The progress of development is shown in Bugzilla with defined bug states as explained in the change proposal template.
Use this tracking bug to show blockers, using the Blocks/Depends on fields (for example package reviews), update the bug description with an actual status, and modify the bug status to reflect current state.
You may be asked by the Program Manager or FESCo members to provide more detailed status (especially for system-wide changes).

A Change is considered _code complete_ when the bug state is moved to ON_QA and when there are no blocking bugs open.

NOTE: See the xref:changes_policy.adoc#_bugzilla_trackers[Bugzilla trackers] section of the Changes policy for more information on Bugzilla statuses.

NOTE: In most cases, you should not submit code changes to Rawhide until after FESCo has voted to approve the proposal.

See the xref:changes_policy.adoc#_change_process_milestones[Change Process Milestones] section of the Changes policy for information on the process milestones.

Changes which cannot be completed for the release are automatically deferred to the next release.
You do not need to re-propose the Change unless you are making substantial revisions to it.
If you need to defer a change, let the Program Manager know and they will update the wiki page and the Bugzilla tracker appropriately.


Minor modifications can be made at any time.
If you have significant modifications to make after a Change is approved, seek FESCo's approval.



This should be descriptive, but unique.
For example "glibc 2.29" is preferable to "glibc upgrade".

TIP: Make sure your page is in the `Changes` namespace (e.g. call it `Changes/glibc_2.29`)

A sentence or two summarizing what this change is and what it will do. This information is used for the overall changeset summary page for each release.
Note that motivation for the change should be in the Motivation section below, and this part should answer the question "What?" rather than "Why?".

TIP: Assume that not everyone who sees this will know what you're talking about.
Give a brief description of packages or services where it makes sense.

For change proposals to qualify as self-contained, owners of all affected packages need to be included here. Alternatively, a SIG can be listed as an owner if it owns all affected packages.

TIP: Use your Bugzilla email in the `email` field to make your Program Manager happy.

Do not edit this section except to set the target release version and update the `[[Category:*]]` tags.

Expand on the summary, if appropriate.
A couple sentences suffices to explain the goal, but the more details you can provide the better.
If there are multiple reasonable approaches, you should indicate why you declined to use the others.

Summarize the feedback from the community and address why you chose not to accept proposed alternatives.
This section is optional for all change proposals, but is strongly suggested.
Incorporating feedback here as it is raised gives FESCo a clearer view of your proposal and leaves a good record for the future.
If you get no feedback, that is useful to note in this section as well.
This section is inspired in part by the "Rejected Ideas" section described by https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#id46[PEP-0001].

For innovative or possibly controversial ideas, consider collecting feedback before you file the change proposal.
This could be done via a post to the devel mailing list for full community feedback, or sharing with some additional people who you trust to give you candid feedback.
In the future, there will be more specific guidance about how to post pre-proposal feedback.
Either way, when you receive feedback, you should summarize it in this section.

TIP: You should fill in this section as feedback is received.
As this is optional the Program Manager does not need to wait for you to complete this section before submitting to FESCo.
If the discussion gets heated, consider asking a neutral party to summarize the discussions for you.
This helps avoid bias and emotional response.


What is the benefit to the distribution?
Will the software we generate be improved?
How will the process of creating Fedora Linux releases be improved?

Be sure to include the following areas if relevant:

* If this is a major capability update, what has changed?
For example: This change introduces Python 5 that runs without the Global Interpreter Lock and is fully multithreaded.
* If this is a new functionality, what capabilities does it bring?
For example: This change allows package upgrades to be performed automatically and rolled-back at will.
* Does this improve some specific package or set of packages?
For example: This change modifies a package to use a different language stack that reduces install size by removing dependencies.
* Does this improve specific Spins or Editions?
For example: This change modifies the default install of Fedora Workstation to be more in line with the base install of Fedora Server.
* Does this make the distribution more efficient?
For example: This change replaces thousands of individual %post scriptlets in packages with one script that runs at the end.
* Is this an improvement to maintainer processes?
For example: Gating Fedora packages on automatic QA tests will make rawhide more stable and allow changes to be implemented more smoothly.
* Is this an improvement targeted at specific contributors?
For example: Ensuring that a minimal set of tools required for contribution to Fedora are installed by default eases the onboarding of new contributors.

TIP: When a Change has multiple benefits, it's better to list them all.


* Proposal owners: What work do the feature owners have to accomplish to complete the feature in time for release?  Is it a large change affecting many parts of the distribution or is it a very isolated change? What are those changes?
* Other developers: *REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES* What work do other developers have to accomplish to complete the feature in time for release?
Is it a large change affecting many parts of the distribution or is it a very isolated change?
What are those changes?
* Release engineering: *REQUIRED FOR SYSTEM-WIDE CHANGES* Does this feature require coordination with release engineering (e.g. changes to installer image generation or update package delivery)?
Is a mass rebuild required?
Include a link to the releng issue.
The issue is required to be filed prior to feature submission, to ensure that someone is on board to do any process development work and testing, and that all changes make it into the pipeline; a bullet point in a change is not sufficient communication.
* Policies and guidelines: Do the packaging guidelines or other documents need to be updated for this feature?
If so, does it need to happen before or after the implementation is done?
If a FPC ticket exists, add a link here.
Where possible, file a pull request against the appropriate policy documents _before submitting the change proposal_.
That way, the community and FESCo can evaluate the specific changes required.
* Trademark approval: If your Change may require trademark approval (for example, if it is a new Spin), file a https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[Fedora Council ticket] requesting trademark approval.
* Alignment with Objectives: Does your proposal align with the xref:project::objectives.adoc[current Fedora Objectives]? This will not apply to many Changes, but it's important to consider when proposing a Change.
Being out of alignment isn't an automatic rejection, it's just one more aspect to consider.

The reason we have a Changes process is to coordinate work across the project.
We want to make sure everyone is aware of what's going on in order to get community feedback and ensure we're working in the same direction.
The Changes process is ultimately about _communication_, not _gatekeeping_.

For an opinionated view on the Changes process, see Ben Cotton's https://opensource.com/article/19/3/managing-changes-open-source-projects[Opensource.com article] or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVV1K3Junkc[DevConf.CZ 2019 talk].


Prior to Fedora 20, Fedora used a process called the “Features” process.
This involved determining if a change was a “feature” or an “enhancement”.
Enhancements were considered not worth tracking, but features were highly user-visible or marketing-worthy and got extra attention.
This was done in the form of manually specifying completion percentage in the wiki and other fun tasks.

FESCo identified several key problems with this process:

* The definition of a “feature” was ambiguous which led to people submitting features unnecessarily, leading to extra administrative overhead.
* The wiki page had duplicated data input
* The process didn’t account for different types or scopes of features
* Features weren’t visible to the community until after the feature proposals were approved

For Fedora 20, we introduced a new process called the “Changes” process.
In some ways, it looks very similar to the previous Features process, but it had a few key differences.
First, Changes are broken out into “System-Wide” and “Self-Contained” changes.
System-Wide changes involve system-wide defaults, critical path components, or other changes that have a broad impact.
Self-Contained changes have limited scope and impact on the rest of the project.
They may be the changes to leaf packages or changes that occur within the responsibility of a single team.
Notably, Changes aren’t necessarily things that get shipped in the distribution—they may also include changes in how packages are built or other sorts of meta-work.

Both System-Wide and Self-Contained Changes go through the same process.
The main differences are the standard of scrutiny and the required input.
System-Wide Changes must list the impact on other developers, a listing of policy changes required, upgrade impact, a test plan, a contingency plan, and documentation.

NOTE: The elections process for the Fedora Linux 40 cycle has begun.
See the xref:_schedule[schedule below] for key dates.
////

Fedora has several elected bodies that regularly conduct elections every release cycle.
In addition, Fedora teams can request one-off elections from the Fedora Program Manager when trying to select new leadership or otherwise reach a decision through a formal voting process.

The following elections will take place after each release:

* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Development/SteeringCommittee/Nominations[FESCo (Engineering)]
* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council/Nominations[Fedora Council]
* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mindshare/Nominations[Mindshare]
* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/Nominations[EPEL Steering Committee]


See the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-43/f-43-elections-tasks.html[election schedule] for authoritative dates.
Dates may change based on the final release date.

From the set of collected questions for nominees to FESCo (Engineering), Fedora Council, and Mindshare|Mindshare teams, top 3 questions are selected, based on https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/156[Council decision].
The selected questions will be given to each candidate to answer before the voting period begins as part of campaign.

The top selected questions for each body are put in templates in a non-public part of the elections-interviews repo (`ssh://git@pagure.io/tickets/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews.git`).

During this period people may self-nominate to open seats.
If they wish to nominate someone else, please consult with that person ahead of time.

Nominees are requested to answer the selected questions using a https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/issues[private issue in Pagure].
In this way, only the Program Manager and Fedora Action and Impact Coordinator (as election wrangler substitute) are allowed to see these answers.

It is the responsibility of the Program Manager to validate the eligibility of nominees for elections.
In compliance with https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/135[Fedora Council decision #135], nominees not having completed their interviews (as a private issue in Pagure) are excluded from the list of nominees.

The Program Manager is responsible for publishing these interviews on the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Community Blog] as well as setup of the https://elections.fedoraproject.org/[voting machine] for the elections.


The xref:elections_guide.adoc[Fedora Elections Guide] has information on the voting method used in the Fedora elections and detailed instructions on how to cast your vote.

If you are familiar with the voting process, you may go straight to the https://elections.fedoraproject.org/[elections application] to cast your votes.

* See the https://elections.fedoraproject.org/archives[Elections archive] for historical results.

Fedora Elections are run using the Elections App and Range Voting.

Eligible voters are determined by their Fedora Account System (FAS) membership.

* To vote for the Fedora Council you must have `cla_done` in FAS.
* To vote for FESCo you must have `cla_done` + one other "non-cla" group in FAS.
* To vote for Mindshare you must have a `cla_done` in FAS.
* To vote for EPEL Steering Committee you must have `cla_done` + one other "non-cla" group in FAS.

Visit the link:++https://elections.fedoraproject.org/++[Elections App] and select the election box you would like to vote in. You may vote in all of the elections if you wish, but you may only vote in each election box once, i.e. you may vote in Council, FESCo and EPEL but you may only vote in each group once and not multiple times. Click on the ‘vote now’ button on the elections box page and select the range you wish to place against each candidate running. It is advisable to allocate a number to each candidate based on your preference.

You will be asked to preview your score, and once you are happy, press the ‘Submit your vote’ button. Then you are done, and don't forget to claim your ‘I Voted!’ Fedora badge too!

Fedora Project has implemented *Range Voting* for our elections, in particular the "Range (score-summing, blanks treated as zero score, no quorum rule)" range voting system.

To cast your vote in this election simply select a value between 0 and 3 with 0 as 'least or no preference' and 3 as 'highest preference'.

At the end of the election, the highest ranking candidate(s) are marked as the winners.

During this period people may self-nominate to open seats.
If they wish to nominate someone else, please consult with that person ahead of time.

Nominees are requested to answer the selected questions using a https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/issues[private issue in Pagure].
In this way, only the Program Manager and Fedora Action and Impact Coordinator (as election wrangler substitute) are allowed to see these answers.

It is the responsibility of the Program Manager to validate the eligibility of nominees for elections.
In compliance with https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/135[Fedora Council decision #135], nominees not having completed their interviews (as a private issue in Pagure) are excluded from the list of nominees.

The Program Manager is responsible for publishing these interviews on the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Community Blog] as well as setup of the https://elections.fedoraproject.org/[voting machine] for the elections.


The xref:elections_guide.adoc[Fedora Elections Guide] has information on the voting method used in the Fedora elections and detailed instructions on how to cast your vote.

If you are familiar with the voting process, you may go straight to the https://elections.fedoraproject.org/[elections application] to cast your votes.

[NOTE]
====
*Eligible Voters*
Voting eligibility is determined by a community member's Fedora Account System (FAS) memberships.

* To vote for the Fedora Council you must have cla_done in FAS.
* To vote for FESCo you must have cla_done + one other "non-cla" group in FAS.
* To vote for Mindshare you must have a cla_done in FAS.
* To vote for EPEL Steering Committee you must have cla_done + one other "non-cla" group in FAS.

The purpose of this process is to help with processing backlog of bugs and issues found during the development, verification, and use of Fedora distribution.
The main goal is to raise visibility of bugs and issues to help contributors focus on the most important issues.
The general criterion for such bugs is "failure to resolve this bug will result in unpleasantness for a subjectively large subset of users".

Bugs that are evaluated as part of the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_blocker_bug_process[blocker bug process] are considered prioritized by virtue of their blocker status.
The prioritized bugs process intentionally excludes include blocker bugs for that reason.

All Fedora community members are welcome to participate by joining the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/triage%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[Triage mailing list] and attending the xref:_evaluation[evaluation meetings].


All the bugs and issues in the Fedora distribution are tracked in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/[Bugzilla].
As such, every item on the "Prioritized bugs and issues" list has assigned a bug ID and can be tracked using standard Bugzilla tools.

The process consists of three main parts:

* Nomination
* Evaluation
* Ageing

NOTE: Prior to November 2019, bugs were tracked using the _Keywords_ and _Whiteboard_ fields in Bugzilla.
This occasionally lead to collisions with how development teams used those fields, so we switched to using a specific flag.


Issues eligible for this status are those which do not necessarily fail a release criterion, but which have critical impact on a Fedora Edition or on a council-approved Fedora Objective.
Issues may also be nominated from the Common Bugs list when they are deemed by QA to have critical impact.

Anyone from the Fedora community can nominate a bug to be evaluated for inclusion to the "Prioritized bugs and issues" list.
The nomination is done by setting the `fedora_prioritized_bug` flag to `?`.

TIP: You may need to click the _set flags_ link on the bug in order for the available flags to appear.

The list of currently nominated bugs waiting for evaluation can be seen using the link:++https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&f1=flagtypes.name&f2=OP&list_id=10626345&o1=substring&query_format=advanced&v1=fedora_prioritized_bug%3F++[Bugzilla search tool].


Evaluation of nominated bugs is done by the Evaluation team.
This team is comprised of the xref:council::fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader] (FPL), xref:council::fpgm.adoc[Fedora Program Manager] (FPgM), and people representing Fedora Working Groups and Special Interest Groups, as well as interested community members.
The team does not have fixed group of members.
Instead members of the Evaluation team are formed at the beginning of the meeting during Roll Call.

The team of evaluators meets on regular bi-weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 10:00 AM US/Eastern in the https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-meeting-1[#fedora-meeting-1] channel.
See https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/base/[Base Fedocal] for the authoritative meeting schedule.
The purpose of the regular meeting is to review bugs nominated to the "Prioritized bugs and issues" list and follow up on previously-approved bugs.

All the bugs accepted during the Evaluation meeting are marked by setting the `fedora_prioritized_bug` flag to `+`.
Bugs that are rejected during the Evaluation meeting are marked by setting the `fedora_prioritized_bug` flag to `-`.
After the evaluation meeting, the chair exports the list of all Prioritized bugs to the "Prioritized bugs and issues" list and sends a report to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/triage%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[Triage mailing list].
Accepted bugs are reviewed in subsequent meetings, time permitting, and if there is no movement, they will be escalated.

The list of currently approved bugs can be seen using the link:++https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&f1=flagtypes.name&f2=OP&list_id=10626381&o1=substring&query_format=advanced&v1=fedora_prioritized_bug%2B++[Bugzilla search tool].



The hope is that most maintainers will see that a bug is flagged as a Prioritized Bug and move it to the top of the pile.
After all, we prioritize relatively few bugs.
However that doesn't always pan out for a variety of reasons.
This is a rough idea of what happens after a bug is accepted as a Prioritized Bug:

* The FPgM marks the bug as prioritized in Bugzilla after the meeting
* After ~1 weeks with no visible progress or acknowledgement, the FPgM marks the assignee as NEEDINFO in Bugzilla
* After another ~1 week with no visible progress or acknowledgement, the FPgM contacts the assignee outside of Bugzilla
* After another ~2 weeks with no visible progress or acknowledgement, the FPL or FPgM will escalate the bug to the assignee's manager (if they are a Red Hat employee acting in their work role) or to a provenpackager

NOTE: The escalation is not intended to be "this person isn't doing their job" in character.
It is a "hey, can you make sure your team has resources to look at this problem that Fedora has identified as a priority?"

NOTE: When need dictates (e.g. a coming release milestone), the timeline above may be compressed.

If the evaluation team determines after working with the maintainers that a resolution is not possible, the team may decide to remove Prioritized Bug status.

This page collects training and reference resources.

This guide provides information on how to do the work of the Fedora Program Manager.
If you are not the Fedora Program Manager, you are welcome to keep reading — this document may be informative for you — but if you don't understand something, that's probably okay.



Fedora's Change Process is important to coordinate the development of the next Fedora release.
We need to know about disrupting changes coming to the next release to set the scope of release, but it also helps as marketing tool even for leaf changes.
For more details on Change Process, see the xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Changes Policy].

The Program Manager's key responsibility is to maintain the Changes Process — xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-announce.adoc[announcements], xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-submit.adoc[submission], xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-process.adoc[processing], xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-contingency.adoc[tracking], xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-defer.adoc[deferring], xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-drop.adoc[dropping]. Completed Changes are closed as part of the xref:pgm_guide/sop/release_day.adoc[Release Day SOP].
One of the main responsibilities is helping Change owners through the submission process.
The Program Manager works on the xref:program_management::changes_policy.adoc[Changes Policy] with the xref:fesco::index.adoc[Fedora Engineering Steering Committee] (FESCo), Working Groups and other Fedora teams and bodies (documentation, marketing, etc.).

This section covers program management information related to the process of getting a release out the door.
The document is in chronological order, referencing various SOPs, with small steps directly in-line, and notes below.

TIP: You may choose to create a https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/31/HouseKeeping[wiki page] to track the status of housekeeping tasks, as has been done historically.


* New release (~1 year before target date)
** xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-new.adoc[New release SOP]
* Spin keepalive deadline (~3 weeks before Branch point)
** xref:pgm_guide/sop/spins-keepalive.adoc[Spins keepalive SOP]
* Rawhide rebase warning (1-3 weeks before Branch point)
** Send the xref:_rebase_warning_mail[rebase warning mail] to devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org, replacing
instances of "TKTK" appropriately
* Branch day
** xref:pgm_guide/sop/branch.adoc[Branching SOP]
** See xref:_bug_rebase_notes[notes on the bug rebase process]
* One week before each Go/No-Go meeting date
** Schedule and announce the meeting, or cancel it if the decision is clearly No-Go:
xref:pgm_guide/sop/go-nogo.adoc[Go/No-Go Meeting SOP]
* Go/No-Go meeting dates
** Run the meeting, following the xref:pgm_guide/sop/go-nogo.adoc[Go/No-Go Meeting SOP].
See xref:gonogo_notes[Go/No-Go Meeting notes]. Follow up with the xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-go.adoc[Go] or xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-no_go.adoc[No-Go] SOP.
* Release day
** xref:pgm_guide/sop/release_day.adoc[Release day SOP]
* 2-14 days after release day
** Follow xref:pgm_guide/sop/eol-warning.adoc[EOL warning SOP] for the N-2 release
* Four weeks after release day
** Follow xref:pgm_guide/sop/eol-day.adoc[EOL day SOP] for the N-2 release


This is the email that should be sent out 1-3 weeks before the Branch point. The actual rebase
is covered in the xref:pgm_guide/sop/branch.adoc[Branching SOP].
....
Greetings,

This e-mail is intended to inform you about the upcoming Bugzilla changes
happening on TKTK (Rawhide bug rebase) and what you need to do, if anything.

We will be automatically changing the version for most rawhide bugs to Fedora TKTK.
This will result in regular bugs reported against rawhide during the Fedora TKTK
development cycle being changed to version 'TKTK' instead of their current
assignment, ‘rawhide’.  This is to align with the branching of Fedora TKTK from
rawhide and to more accurately tell where in the lineage of releases the bug was
last reported.

Note that this procedure does not apply to bugs that are open for the ‘Package
Review’ or 'kernel' components or bugs that have the ''FutureFeature'' or ''Tracking'' keywords
set. These will stay open as rawhide bugs indefinitely.

If you do not want your bugs changed to version ‘TKTK‘, add the ''FutureFeature''
keyword. If you need help changing a large amount of bugs manually, we’d be glad
to help.

The process was re-approved by FESCo https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1096 .
....


Bugs that meet all of the following conditions are branched from Rawhide to the newly-created version:

* product == "Fedora" or "Fedora Container Images"
* version == rawhide
* component != "Package Review"
* component != "Container Review"
* component != "kernel"
* component != "Changes Tracking"
* keyword ''FutureFeature'' is '''not''' present
* keyword ''Tracking'' is '''not''' present
* the string ''RFE'' is '''not''' present in the summary
* status != CLOSED

According to jforbes, the reason we exclude kernel bugs is two-fold:
1. A number of reported kernel bugs are longer-term issues that need to be solved over time, or bugs which upstream has to eventually get to.
It has become the place to file these bugs, even if not against the rawhide kernel in specific so that they do not get auto closed in a year.
2. Rawhide kernels are most typically built as debug kernels only, and many bugs filed against them are not reproducible on branched non-debug kernels.


The https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/go_nogo.txt[meeting script] in the xref:pgm_guide/sop/go-nogo.adoc[Go/No-Go SOP] provides a general framework for running the Go/No-Go meeting.
The general flow is to verify that a compose is available, review blocker bugs, check that the test matrices are completed, and that CoreOS and IoT are ready.

The compose section is generally very quick.
Release Engineering or QA will confirm that a candidate compose exists.
If there is no candidate compose, skip straight to a "no-go" decision.

If there are proposed or accepted blocker bugs, the meeting becomes a blocker review meeting to evaluate them.
This portion of the meeting can be led by a member of the QA team or by the Program Manager.
It is not uncommon to defer some bugs until later in the meeting so that last-minute testing can be performed.

In the test matrices section, QA will review the results of tests.
Some optional tests may not be complete.

Finally, the Program Manager polls each of the constituent teams.
If they all vote "go", then the release is "go" and will be released on the coming Tuesday.
The Program Manager's work is done (at least as far as this goes).
If the release is "no-go", then a follow-up meeting must happen.

The link:../../prioritized_bugs[Prioritized Bugs] process is designed to get attention for issues that are not blockers, but are still high-impact or high-visibility.
The criteria are intentionally subjective and we will drop bugs from the list if we can't convince developers to make progress.

On Fridays (or whatever day you prefer), it's good to review the accepted Prioritized Bugs and make sure they're not getting stale.
See the link:../../prioritized_bugs#_process_for_accepted_bugs[process documentation] for guidance on how to give nudges.

The Fedora Program Manager is responsible for conducting elections for various bodies within Fedora.
After each release, the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee run an election. The Fedora Council, Mindshare Committee and EPEL Steering Committee run an election on a once per year basis.
Other teams may request elections at any time if they have a need.

The Fedora Community Architect (FCA) is the backup elections wrangler.
The FCA & FPgM cannot be candidates for elected positions.

NOTE: FESCo has a xref:fesco::FESCo_election_policy.adoc[separate election policy] that requires more candidates than open seats.

Fedora's election process is important to our community governance model.
Therefore, transparency and trust are vital.
This is one area where strictly adhering to the published process is important.
Avoid giving the appearance of special treatment to candidates.

NOTE: At one time, we were hoping to have the Fedora Podcast conduct interviews with candidates as well, but that has fizzled.

NOTE: A long time ago, we conducted IRC town halls with candidates.
We stopped doing that.

Developing and maintaining the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[Fedora Project's schedule] may be the most important part of the Fedora Program Manager's job.
The good news is that it is not very hard.
https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2211#comment-590831[FESCo approved] reusing the same general structure for every release, with target release dates of the third Tuesday in April and October.
Now it will only change if there are major requirements that necessitate a deviation.
This helps with planning for Fedora as well as for our downstreams (read: RHEL).

Of course, you can—and should—make small changes to the schedule as processes evolve.
This may mean adding, removing, or moving some tasks.
Or it might mean changing which teams are reflecting in the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[web view] of the schedule.

NOTE: FESCo https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2329[authorized] Release Engineering to start the mass rebuild up to five days after the scheduled start date.
This allows RelEng to accommodate travel for Flock and DevConf.CZ, which often fall near the start of the mass rebuild.


The schedule lives in https://app.smartsheet.com[Smartsheet] (only available to Red Hat employees).
Every so often, go in and copy a few releases forward.

In your new schedule:

* Update the “Fedora XX Release”
* Find and replace N-1 with N (have to do it manually so as to not get dates)
* Find and replace N-2 with N-1 (same)

Tasks are assigned to teams with flags.
The `pp` flag has no meaning for the community, but is used to keep in sync with other Red Hat products.
Some fields (e.g. requirements gathering) are not relevant, but required for xref:_product_pages[Product Pages].
Product Pages only cares about the *key* flag.

TIP: If you want links in the schedule, add the URL in the “links” column for that task (the `Link:` keyword is optional now). It will be shown in the rendered schedule.

The Early Final target date is the “master milestone” against which everything else is anchored.

TIP: Before publishing the schedule, check to be sure that it doesn't conflict too horribly with major holidays, etc.

To publish the schedule, *Export to Microsoft Project (XML)* and save the file to the `f-N` directory in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/schedule[schedule repository] as `Fedora.Schedule.xml`.

TIP: If *Export to Microsoft Project (XML)* is not an option, you might need to switch to Gantt view.
Smartsheet isn't very smart in that regard.

When schedules slip:

1. Add a new target date (e.g. Beta target date #2)
2. Update the “Current X target date” when you know it's really going to happen


The files used to publish the scripts live in a https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/schedule[git repository].

To create a schedule for a new version (f-30 in this example):

. `mkdir f-30`
. `cp ../f-29/Makefile . && vi Makefile` # copy forward from previous and change the version
. Export the XML file (see previous section)
. `git add Fedora.Schedule.xml Makefile`
. `git commit -m ‘Your commit message here’`
. to see the changes locally: `make` # `make clean` cleans up your mess
. `make publish` # publish html and friends to fedorapeople

NOTE: The rsync invocations in the Makefile assume you have your user name set in `~/.ssh/config` if your local name does not match your Fedora account.

To update the index page of the website, or the CSS file used to style it, start from the schedule repo above:

1. `cd html`
2. Edit the appropriate file
3. `make publish` to rsync to fedorapeople
4. Commit and push your edits



https://pp.engineering.redhat.com/[Product Pages] is the central resource for Red Hat internal product schedule and status information.

To register a new version in product pages:

. Go to admin page (*Platforms* > *Fedora Project* > *Overview*)
. Click *Add new release* button
. Short name: 30
. Select all the sections to copy
. Click *OK*
. Click *Schedules* tab
. Click *Add schedules* button
. Handle: <get the Smartsheet file URL or ID>
. Switch draft to approved
. Set phase to planning

TIP: Prior to May 2021, we used a Red Hat CVS server for the schedule files.
They now are pulled directly into Product Pages from Smartsheet.

Key fields:

* *Platforms*: if you want to update it, add the list of platforms Fedora supports (used by RH releng, but Fedora releng doesn't use it. so it's entirely optional)
* *Documents*: just make a link to the wiki
* *People*: update this as appropriate
* *Communication*: list of important IRC channels and mailing lists


Update the phases when there's a significant change (e.g. Beta release -> change to testing).

Update the status on a weekly basis (due Thursday afternoon US East coast time).
Green means no risks and no slippage; you don't need to say much.
Yellow means there are risks, but we have it under control.
Describe what went wrong and how we're going to address it.
Red means "oh noes!"; explain a lot more.


This section is a collection of loosely-organized facts that give some of the history of schedule wrangling.

* Schedules used to be done with TaskJuggler (version 2, specifically).
If you ever need to do anything with the old schedule files, you will need to get a copy of that.
(By the time you read this, it will likely be retired from Fedora.)
* We used to copy key milestones to a wiki page.
Ben Cotton stopped doing that because it was annoying and he's error-prone.


Communicating is the most important part of the Fedora Operations Architect's job.
There are few _required_ communications for the Fedora ops architect, but your success will depend in part on communicating information out to the community.

This section describes what Ben Cotton did.
Feel free to modify and adapt it to fit your style.

Unless otherwise indicated, the communications in this section are stored in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/[pgm_communication] repository.


This is a https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/[weekly report] in the Fedora Community Blog.
It is published on Friday afternoons and contains a summary of the previous week's activities and upcoming events.
The readership numbers, as reported by WordPress, are not overwhelming, but everyone I talk to about it expresses appreciation.
When you're doing your job right as a program manager, you don't get much feedback.

I keep the content up-to-date during the week by editing the `fridays_fedora_facts.md` file in the `pgm_communication` repository.
You can use `pandoc` to convert this to HTML to paste directly into the WordPress console.

The sections to include are:

* *Announcements* — Important announcements, including package retirements, conference calls for papers (see below), policy proposals and changes, etc.
For items with a defined deadline, I generally leave the announcement in there until the deadline has passed.
For items without a defined deadline, I leave them for 1–4 weeks, depending on the relevance and impact.
* *Help wanted* — Requests for help from teams within Fedora.
These generally come from observing the meeting minutes and mailing lists of teams within Fedora.
I generally leave them for a few weeks.
* *Upcoming meetings & test days* — Project-level meetings that will occur within the next week.
I generally include Council meetings, blocker review meetings, prioritized bugs meetings, and the xref:_fpgm_office_hours[FPgM office hours] as regular entries.
I also include the xref:release_process.adoc#_gono_go_meeting[Go/No-Go] meetings when appropriate.
If the QA team has organized test days, I will include those as well.
* *Fedora N* — Information about the current in-progress Fedora release (you may have N+1 as well).
** *Schedule* — Upcoming schedule milestones, generally within the next month
** *Changes* — Changes announced, submitted to FESCo, and approved/rejected by FESCo.
These are normally removed the week following approval or rejection.
I link to the wiki page and — while the proposal is pending with FESCo — a link to the FESCo ticket.
If changes are withdrawn after being approved, I will keep the withdrawal in the report a length of time that seems reasonable to me at the time.
** *Blocker bugs* — A table including the bug ID (with a link to Bugzilla), blocker status (proposed or accepted), component, and bug status.
I include this once I begin producing the xref:_blocker_report[blocker bug report].


There's no one, unified place to get relevant CfPs.
Pay attention to social media (particularly upstream accounts), etc.
You can also use:

* https://confs.tech/cfp
* http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=open%20source
* https://www.cfpland.com/

This is no longer active, but if a need for it resurfaces, content can be found in the file `office_hours.md` in the `pgm_communication` repository.


The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_blocker_bug_process[blocker bug process] belongs to the QA team, but Ben Cotton adopted the weekly blocker review email to give Adam Williamson more time to test and diagnose bugs.
The content of the email is in the `blocker_email.txt` file in the `pgm_communication` repository.

Begin sending the emails on the first Friday of the Beta freeze and continue until the final release is declared "Go".
I generally ignore the final blockers until Beta is released.

To produce the report:

1. Go through each of the bugs in the https://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs[Blocker Bugs] list
2. Review the content of the bug and summarize the current state, including upstream bug URLs, package updates that require testing, etc.
3. Note the action required for each bug.
This may be QA verifying a fix, upstream fixing the bug, the package maintainer producing a new release, etc.
If the bug has the _needinfo_ flag set, include that.
4. Add the bug owner to the bcc list if they have an action item.
Also include anyone marked as needinfo.
5. Include an action summary at the top.
6. Send the email to the devel and test mailing lists, and bcc the people you identified above.

The Fedora Program Manager sits on the Fedora Council as an auxiliary member.
The FPgM generally leads the regular Council meetings and keeps an eye on the https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issues[ticket queue].
There is not much to say here, just help bring some structure to the Council and make sure tickets are appropriately categorized and don't languish.

The `provenpackagers` group grants members write privileges across all Fedora packages.
Thus, we want to make sure the privilege doesn't linger on inactive accounts.
In early 2021, https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2549[FESCo adopted] a policy for xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc#_maintaining_provenpackager_status[maintaining provenpackager status].

The Fedora Program Manager is charged with performing an audit of these accounts.
This should take place at about the branch point of each development cycle.

The https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/provenpackager/inactive_provenpackagers.py[inactive_provenpackagers.py] script will check for provenpackagers that have not submitted a Koji build in the last six months.
It produces a list of accounts that fail this test, as well as accounts that do not exist in Koji.

After running this script, send the output to the named accounts as well as devel-announce.
You will get some replies from people who would like to retain the status.
By policy, all they have to do is ask to keep it and they may.

After two weeks, submit an infrastructure ticket to remove provenpackager status from anyone who did not request keeping the group membership.
You do not need to submit it to FESCo for a vote.

TIP: Some packagers may choose to submit a build without telling you.
Before you submit the removal request, you probably want to re-run the inactive_provenpackagers script to see if anyone dropped off the list.

This page contains information about administering the Fedora aspects of Red Hat Bugzilla.
Information on xref:pgm_guide/sop/branch.adoc[branching], xref:pgm_guide/sop/eol-warning.adoc[EOL warning], and xref:pgm_guide/sop/eol-day.adoc[EOL closure] are in this guide's SOPs.


The following groups are used for Fedora:

|===
|Name|Purpose

|fedora_contrib|Grants additional permissions.
Populated automatically from several groups in Fedora Accounts.
|fedora_pm|Can edit components in various products in the Fedora classification
|fedora_pm_approves|Users who can approve membership of fedora_pm
|fedora_rules_admin|Can administer rules engine for Fedora
|===

NOTE: Membership in the _++fedora_pm++_ group only grants permissions to edit components the like.
_++fedora_contrib++_ is what lets people do the usual stuff.

Congratulations!
You're the new Fedora Program Manager.
Whether you're new to Red Hat, to the Fedora Community, or both, there's a lot to learn.
Here's a list of things you'll need to get started:

You can't do much of anything in Fedora without this. Visit the https://accounts.fedoraproject.org[account signup page] to create an account. If you already have one from your previous work with Fedora, then you're all set.

* *https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/elections/[elections]* — Used to manage the xref:elections.adoc[elections].
* *https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/council/[council]* — Grants access to Council-related things
* *https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/program-management/[program-management]* — Grants access to the xref:pgm_guide/schedule.adoc[schedule] project on fedorapeople.org

** SOPs
*** Release steps

This document outlines procedures for new releases.
Note that schedules are often generated up to three years in advance,
so they are covered separately.


On or about a year before the target release date.

If a Change proposal is submitted for the release, that's a good time to start this process.


. Create a tracking bug in Bugzilla
.. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?component=Changes%20Tracking&product=Fedora&version=rawhide[Create a bug in the "Changes Tracking" component]
.. Set the summary to "Fedora Linux NN Change proposal tracker"
.. Set the description to "This is a tracking bug for FNN Changes."
.. Click "Submit Bug" so you can add additional information
.. Add "Tracking" to the Keywords field
.. Click "Show advanced fields" if they're not already visible
.. Click "Edit" on the Alias and set it to "FNNChanges"
.. Click "Save Changes"
. Add docs to the xref:releases::index.adoc[Releases] module
.. Make an `fNN` directory
.. Copy the contents from the previous release to this directory
.. Update the `:release-version:` macro in each adoc file
.. Add listings to `nav.adoc` under the "Upcoming Releases" header.
Copy the previous release's entries and update version numbers as appropriate.
. Update the schedule
.. Create a schedule for the new release, following the ../schedule[Schedule SOP]
.. Add the new release to the index.html page on the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[web view]
of the schedule.
. Update the wiki Change pages for the new release
.. Create the `Releases/NN/ChangeSet` page on the wiki. Use the template below for guidance

.Wiki template for ChangeSet page

This document outlines the procedures for activities that occur on "branch day":
when the next Fedora Linux release branches from Rawhide.

Many of the branching activities are handled by Release Engineering, but several are in the scope of the Fedora Program Manager.


This process occurs once per release.
The branch day happens between the mass rebuild and the Beta freeze.


All of the following procedures should be run in the order listed.

. Adjust wording of the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/editproducts.cgi?action=edit&product=Fedora[Fedora product] in Bugzilla to reflect the branch.

....
Bugs related to the components of the Fedora distribution. If you are reporting a bug
against a stable release or a branched pre-release version, please select that
version number. The currently maintained released versions are: Fedora Linux N-1, Fedora Linux N.
The branched pre-released version is Fedora Linux N+1. If you have a bug to report against
the daily development tree (rawhide), please choose 'rawhide' as the version.

For more information about filing a bug against Fedora packages, see
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/
....

. Create N+1 in Bugzilla's https://bugzilla.redhat.com/editversions.cgi?product=Fedora[Fedora] product versions.
. Create N+1 in Bugzilla's https://bugzilla.redhat.com/editversions.cgi?product=Fedora%20Container%20Images[Fedora Container Images] product versions.


WARNING: If you run this after Branch Day, you will need to add constraint on the bug open date. See below.

. Change the F<N+1>Changes bug and bugs that block it to the branched version.
. Run the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/closebugs/fedora_bz.py[`fedora_bz.py` script] to change the version on rawhide bugs to the new release. For example: `./fedora_bz.py branch 40` (if the new release is 40).
. If you are running the script late, use the `--date` option to specify the branch date: `./fedora_bz.py branch --date=2024-02-06 40`. This will make the script only change the version on bugs filed before the branch date.

WARNING: This script will take a while to run.
Execute it from a machine with stable power and networking.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?classification=Fedora&f1=component&f3=component&f4=bug_status&f5=component&f6=component&keywords=FutureFeature%2C%20Tracking%2C%20&keywords_type=nowords&list_id=10832664&o1=notequals&o3=notequals&o4=notequals&o5=notequals&o6=notequals&product=Fedora&product=Fedora%20Container%20Images&query_format=advanced&short_desc=RFE&short_desc_type=notregexp&v1=Package%20Review&v3=kernel&v4=CLOSED&v5=Changes%20Tracking&v6=Container%20Review&version=rawhide[This Bugzilla query] is similar to the one the script uses to select bugs that meet the xref:pgm_guide/release_process.adoc#_branch_day[criteria]. You can use it to check the list before running the script if you like.



. Set F<N> to the "Development/Testing" phase.
. Set F<N+1> to the "Development" phase.

This document outlines procedures for scheduling and running the xref:pgm_guide/release_process.adoc#_gono_go_meeting[Go/No-Go meeting].


The first go/no-go meeting occurs on the Thursday before the early target date for a release.
Meetings recur weekly until the release is GO.



. Schedule the meeting in Fedocal's https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/Fedora%20release/[Fedora release] calendar.
The Go/No-Go meeting is traditionally held on the Thursday prior to the release date from 17:00–19:00 UTC.
. Select an available meeting channel.
It is best to set the meeting to recur weekly for 3 weeks in case of multiple slips.
. Send an email 5–7 calendar days before the meeting to the devel-announce, logistics, and test-announce mailing lists.


The https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/go_nogo.txt[script for the Go/No-Go meeting] is in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/[pgm_communication repo].

Follow this script and then follow the xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-go.adoc[Go] or xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-no_go.adoc[No-Go] SOP as appropriate.

The document outlines the procedure for delaying the release.
Refer to the xref:releases::lifecycle.adoc#_schedule_contingency_planning[schedule contingency planning] docs for when to delay future milestones.

1. In xref:pgm_guide/schedule.adoc#_smartsheet[Smartsheet], add a new milestone (if needed) and update the Current (Beta|Final) Target date milestone to have the new target date as a predecessor.
2. Save the updated schedule to the xref:pgm_guide/schedule.adoc#_git_repo[git repository] and publish to the web.
3. Update xref:pgm_guide/schedule.adoc#_product_pages[Product Pages].
If the new target date is beyond target date #1 or you have reason to believe the release will slip further, set the status to yellow.
If the new target date is beyond target date #2 or you have reason to believe the release will slip further, set the status to red.
4. Send an announcement email similar to the below to logistics@lists.fedoraproject.org, devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org, test-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org, and rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org.
5. Update the dates in the xref:pgm_guide/pgm_communication.adoc#_fpgm_report[report] and xref:pgm_guide/pgm_communication.adoc#_fpgm_office_hours[office hours] files.


TIP: These are suggestions.
You can and should customize them to meet specific releases and your own "voice".

TIP: For the Beta release announcement, include the date that the Final freeze starts.


This document outlines the procedure for when a release is declared "no-go".


1. Follow the xref:pgm_guide/sop/release-delay.adoc[Release delay SOP].
2. Cancel the go/no-go meeting if the "no-go" determination is made preemptively.

For the Final milestone:

1. Submit a pull request to the <VERSION-2> release's https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-release[fedora-release package] to update the eol_date variable in the `fedora-release.spec` file.
You may need to request a new package build from the Release Engineering team.
2. Update the <VERSION-2> release schedule's EOL date entry.
3. File a https://pagure.io/releng/new_issue[releng issue] requesting update of the <VERSION-2> release's EOL date in Bodhi.

This document outlines the procedure for release day activities.
Unless otherwise specified, it applies to both Beta and Final releases.


Ensure the following people are in the https://matrix.to/#/#release-day:fedora.im[Release Day chat channel]:

* You, as the Program Manager
* A representative from the Infrastructure team with access to force a re-sync of web proxies
* A representative from the Websites team
* A representative from the Magazine team
* A representative from the Docs team
* The Fedora Project Leader

This channel is used to coordinate the last-minute checks before publishing the release announcements:

* Websites are updated with the new release information:
** fedoraproject.org
** spins.fedoraproject.org
** labs.fedoraproject.org
* (Final milestone only) Docs are updated with the new release information:
** Release Notes
** Quick Docs
* Fedora Magazine posts
** Release announcement
** (Final milestone only) What's new in FXX Workstation.

NOTE: The "What's new in FXX Workstation" needs to go out with the release announcement because GNOME Software expects the target link to exist.

WARNING: The release announcement and "what's new in workstation" articles need to have URLs that match the patterns that GNOME Software expects.
Beta announcement is `announcing-fedora-XX-beta`.
Final announcement is `announcing-fedora-XX`.
"What's new" is `whats-new-fedora-XX-workstation`.
The Magazine team is ultimately responsible for this, but it's good to verify.


This section applies to the Final milestone only.

Adjust wording of the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/editproducts.cgi?action=edit&product=Fedora[Fedora product] in Bugzilla to reflect the new release.

....
Bugs related to the components of the Fedora Linux distribution. If you are reporting a
bug against a stable release or a branched pre-release version please select that
version number. The currently maintained released versions are: Fedora Linux N-2,
Fedora Linux N-1, and Fedora Linux N. If you have a bug to report against the daily
development tree (rawhide), please choose 'rawhide' as the version.

Close all of the Changes Tracking bugs still open for the version with:

* Status: _CLOSED_
* Resolution: _CURRENTRELEASE_
* Comment: Something to the effect of "F<VERSION> was released today, so I am closing this tracker. If this Change was not completed, please notify me ASAP."

Then close the FNNTracking bug.

TIP: You can use https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?f1=blocked&list_id=11983255&o1=substring&query_format=advanced&v1=F39Changes[this Bugzilla query] with the version number changed.


This section applies to the Final milestone only.

* Edit the ChangeSet page in the wiki to include a link to the release notes and take the table of contents off the top.
* Update the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes[Changes wiki page] to move the release to the "Previous Releases" section.


This section applies to the Final milestone only.

Update the index.html page on the https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[web view] of the schedule to change the class of the release from "current" to "supported".
Publish the changes using the xref:pgm_guide/schedule.adoc#_git_repo[instructions for the schedule git repo].


This section applies to the Final milestone only.

Update the xref:releases::index.adoc[Releases page] (or really, the `nav.adoc` sidebar).

* Move the link to the release's index page from Upcoming to Supported.
* Remove the additional pages nested under the release.


For the Beta milestone, set the release to *Testing* status.

For the Final milestone, set the release to *Maintenance* status.
Then add a status for version N-2 to indicate that EOL is in four weeks.

This document outlines the procedure for doing the end-of-life (EOL) warning.


This process is triggered by the release of Fedora Linux N+2.
The schedule calls for it to occur two days after the release, but any time within two weeks of release day is sufficient.


Add a warning comment on open bugs for the release that will soon go EOL using the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/closebugs/fedora_bz.py[`fedora_bz.py` script].

For example, to post the warning on Fedora Linux 37 bugs: `./fedora_bz.py eolwarn 37`

The script will read the EOL date from Bodhi, or you can override it, e.g. `./fedora_bz.py eolwarn --date=2023-12-05 37`

WARNING: This script will take a while to run.
Execute it from a machine with stable power and networking.
If the script does die, you can re-run it like `./fedora_bz.py --start-bug 123456 eolwarn 37` to start after bug #123456.
Use the number of the last bug that was successfully edited.
As a safety check, the script will exit if the first bug in the list already has the comment.

The script comments on all "Fedora" and "Fedora Container Images" bugs for the release which are still open, unless they have the **Tracking** keyword.
This {bugzilla_eol_query}[Bugzilla query] is similar to the one it uses (if you want to examine the list before running the script).

This document outlines the procedure for performing end-of-life (EOL) activities.


This process occurs four weeks after the release of Fedora Linux N+2.



Close open bugs using the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/closebugs/fedora_bz.py[`fedora_bz.py` script].

For example, to close Fedora Linux 37 bugs: `./fedora_bz.py eolclose 37`

The script will read the EOL date from Bodhi, or you can override it, e.g. `./fedora_bz.py eolclose --date=2023-12-05 37`.

You can re-run the script to verify that all bugs are closed (it should change 0 bugs).

WARNING: This script will take a while to run.
Execute it from a machine with stable power and networking.
If it dies, you can re-run it and it should pick up where it left off.

The script closes all "Fedora" and "Fedora Container Images" bugs for the EOL release which are still open, unless they have the **Tracking** keyword.
This {bugzilla_eol_query}[Bugzilla query] is similar to the one it uses (if you want to examine the list before running the script).


If you get a request to re-open a bug, do that as a service to the users.



Adjust the wording of the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/editproducts.cgi?action=edit&product=Fedora[Fedora product] in Bugzilla to reflect the EOL.

[#update_changeset]

After processing approved or deferred Changes, and regularly throughout the late part of the release cycle, update the wiki page listing that release's approved Changes.

. Process the status with the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/changes[scripts]
.. Run `make version=<NN> type=<SystemWide|SelfContained> build` to download and parse the wiki pages.
This includes a check of the current status of the tracker bugs in Bugzilla
. Copy the content of the `ChangesList` file
. Paste it into the appropriate section of the `Release/F<NN>/ChangeSet` page in the wiki

This document describes the process of announcing xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes].


This process is constant.


Proposals are sent to the development community for public comment.

. Verify that the proposal is complete and correct
.. You can choose to announce proposals that are missing some required fields (e.g. Releng ticket), on the condition that those are complete before it is sent to FESCo
.. Ensure the page has the `{{Change_Proposal_Banner}}` macro at the top
.. Put the _Owner_ and _Email_ fields are one line instead of multiple.
This will make the BZ creation easier later.
. Compose an email as follows.
.. Set the `to:` field to `devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org` and the `reply-to:` field to `devel@lists.fedoraproject.org`
.. Set the subject to _F<NN> proposal: <title> (<System-Wide|Self-Contained> Change proposal)_.
This is to make it clear to external readers that this is a _proposal_ and not a final decision.
.. In the body of the email, add the URL to the wiki page
.. Copy the "this is a proposal" content from the wiki page into the body.
Again, this is so that it's unambigiously clear.
.. Copy the wiki source into the body, removing comments and performing other readability cleanup as you deem necessary.
. Send the email
. Create a post in the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/project/changes/89[Discourse Change Proposals category].
.. Set the topic to _F<NN> Change Proposal: <title> (<System-Wide|Self-Contained>)_.
.. Place a link to the wiki page and a link to the devel-announce post at the top of the post.
.. Then copy the "this is a proposal" content from the wiki page into the post.
.. Copy the contents of the wiki page into the post, applying Markdown formatting as appropriate. You can try converting the wiki text to markdown by saving it as `change.txt` and running  `pandoc -f mediawiki -w markdown /change.txt -o /change.md`, but it will not work perfectly and will still require manual adjustment.
. Reply to your original announcement email, again with `reply-to` set to `devel@lists.fedoraproject.org`, with the content:
`The discussion thread to provide feedback for this change proposal can be found here: https://(link_to_discourse_post)`
. Update the wiki page
.. Replace the `ChangeReadyForWrangler` category with `ChangeAnnounced`
.. Add a link to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce thread] in the _Current status_ section, with the title "Announced"
.. Add a link to the Discourse thread in the same section, with the title "Discussion Thread"
. Add an entry to the _Changes_ table for the release in xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.adoc[Friday's Fedora Facts]

Once you have sent the email, you do not need to further participate in the discussion.
However, you should at least monitor the tone in case it gets heated.

TIP: You can use the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/changes/pending_changes.py[pending_changes.py script] to list proposals that are awaiting announcement.
This is particularly helpful if you set it up in a cron job or systemd timer.

This document describes the process of submitting xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes] to FESCo.


Submit Changes one week after the proposal is xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-announce.adoc[announced].


After a week of discussion (or longer if the discussion is still productively active), submit it to FESCo for approval.

. Open an issue with the https://pagure.io/fesco/new_issue?template=change_proposal[Change proposal template]
.. Use `Change: <title>` as the issue title
.. Replace the angle bracketed fields as appropriate
.. Set the _Assignee_ of the issue to be the first person listed on the proposal
.. Set the _system-wide change_ or _self-contained change_ tag as appropriate
.. Set the _Milestone_ as appropriate
. In the proposal wiki page
.. Replace the `ChangeAnnounced` category with `ChangeReadyForFesco`
.. Add the FESCo ticket URL in the _Current status_ section
. Update the xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.adoc[Friday's Fedora Facts] entry

This document describes the process of processing xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes] after FESCo's vote.


Process Changes after the vote is final per xref:fesco::index.adoc#_ticket_policy[FESCo's ticket policy].



. Note the vote (e.g. "APPROVED (+6,0,-0)") in the comment, if not already recorded
. Apply the _pending announcement_ label if the issue is still open.
This lets the next meeting chair know to include an announcement of the decision in the agenda
. Edit the proposal's wiki page
.. Remove the `{{Change_Proposal_Banner}}` macro
.. Replace the `ChangeReadyForFesco` category with `ChangeAcceptedF<NN>`
. Create new bugs with the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/changes[scripts]
.. Run `make version=<NN> type=<SystemWide|SelfContained> build` to download and parse the wiki pages
.. Run `make bz` to create tracking bugs in Bugzilla.
. Edit the created bug
.. Add yourself to the _cc_ field
.. Set the bug to block the `F<NN>Changes` tracking bug
.. Set the bug status to `ASSIGNED`
. When appropriate (see below), create a Release Notes issue with the https://gitlab.com/fedora/docs/fedora-linux-documentation/release-notes/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Change[Change template].
.. Use `Change: <title>` as the issue title
.. Replace `URL HERE` with the wiki URL
.. Set the _Milestone_ appropriately
. Add the Bugzilla and Release Notes links to the wiki page
. Update the xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.adoc[Friday's Fedora Facts] entry
. Update the ChangeSet page
.. In the scripts directory, run:
... `make clean`
... `make version=<NN> type=<SystemWide|SelfContained> build` to regenerate the content
... Copy the contents of _ChangesList_ and paste into the appropriate section of the ChangeSet page
. If the Change involves a new Spin, add it to the xref:releases::index.adoc[Releases docs].

WARNING: Bugzilla requires an email address to exist in the system in order to add it to a bug.
If an email address listed on a wiki page does not exist in Bugzilla, that address will not be CCed on the bug.
If no address listed exists in Bugzilla, the bug will remain assigned to the Change Wrangler.
In that case you should try and find an address for a Change owner that does exist in Bugzilla and re-assign it, or ask the Change owner(s) to register in Bugzilla.

TIP: If the Change involves creating a new Spin, send the owners the xref:releases::spins/creating.adoc[Creating a Spin docs].
Otherwise, the coordination with Websites et al will probably be overlooked.

RELEASE NOTES: most Changes should be considered for release notes, but sometimes this does not make sense.
When a Change will not result in any notable impact on end users that can comprehensibly be explained to them, a release note is not necessary.
An example of such a Change is https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/PortingToModernC : this is a highly technical Change that is only of consequence and interest to Fedora maintainers, not end users.
When it does not make sense for a Change to have release notes, put "Release Notes tracker: N/A" in the "Current status" section of the Change page.


If a Change proposal is rejected by FESCo:

. Add `{{Change_Rejected_Banner}}` to the proposal's wiki page below the title
. Update the wiki page category to `Category:ChangePageIncomplete`
. If a tracking bug was pre-created, close it with Status _CLOSED -> DEFERRED_.

This document describes the process of evaluating the contingency plans of  xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes].


Evaluate contigency plans at the following points in the release schedule:

* Start of the mass rebuild
* Branch day
* Completion Checkpoint (Testable) deadline
* Completion Checkpoint (100% complete) deadline
* Start of Beta freeze
* Start of Final freeze

In addition, if a Change has a different contingency deadline for whatever reason, evaluate plans then.


In general, the process is to check with the owner and ask if the Change is on track.
If not, work with them to xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-defer.adoc[defer it].

The two "change completion checkpoint" milestones on the schedule have specific actions.


This part of the process runs at the "Completion deadline (testable)" and "Completion deadline (100% complete)" milestones of the release schedule.

. On the deadline day, use the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/closebugs/fedora_bz.py[`fedora_bz.py` script] to comment on bugs that block the Changes tracking bug that do are not at least as far as MODIFIED (testable deadline) or ON_QA (100% complete deadline).
.. For the testable deadline, run e.g. `./fedora_bz.py deadline-testable 2024-02-20 40`, where 40 is the release number and 2024-02-20 is the **100% complete** deadline date (**NOT** the testable deadline date - this date is needed because the comment mentions it).
.. For the 100% complete deadline, run e.g. `./fedora_bz.py deadline-complete 40`, where 40 is the release number. No date is needed here.
. The next day, create a FESCo issue using one of the xref:#fesco-issue-templates[FESCo issue templates] below.
You may choose to try to figure out if a change is complete yourself, but you are not obligated to.
. Continue to update the FESCo issue as bugs are updated.
. Update or defer Changes as voted by FESCo.

This document describes the process of deferring xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes] to the next release.


This process is triggered by FESCo or the owner deciding to defer a change.
Often, this is the result of missing a xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes-contingency.adoc[contingency deadline or completion milestone].
Unless the Change changes significantly, it does not need to go through the process again.
Chnages can be deferred indefinitely.


. **Reply to the mailing list thread**, only if the proposal has not yet been submitted to FESCo.
. **Update the _Milestone_ in the FESCo ticket**, only if the ticket is still open
(in other words, if FESCo has not yet reached a decision).
. **Update the Change's wiki page.**
Change the "Targeted Release" to the new release.
Change the category to "ChangeAcceptedF<N>".
. **Update the tracking bug.**
Update the _Blocks_ field with the new release's Change tracking bug.
If the Change is deferred after bugs have been branched, reset the version to "rawhide".
. **Update the Release Notes issue.**
Set the _Milestone_ field to the new target release.
. **Re-run the Change processing scripts for the old and new target release.**
See the xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes.adoc#update_changeset[instructions].

NOTE: If the Change was previously approved, do not award the badge for the re-targeted release.

This document describes the process of dropping xref:changes_policy.adoc[Changes].


This process is triggered by FESCo or the owner deciding to drop a change.
Often, this is the result of a Change having significant issues, or a maintainer losing interest.
For the Change to be revived it must go through the full process again, starting by being updated and moved back to ChangeReadyForWrangler.


. **Reply to the mailing list thread**, only if the proposal has not yet been submitted to FESCo.
. **Close the FESCo ticket**, if one has been opened and is still open.
. **Update the Change's wiki page.**
Clear the "Targeted Release".
Change the category to "ChangePageIncomplete".
Add a header at the top: `{{admon/important|Change dropped|This Change is dropped. It can be re-proposed if interest in it revives.}}`
It is a good idea to also include an appropriate reference - a link to a FESCo ticket or meeting log, or a message from the Change owner.
. **Update the tracking bug, if it exists.**
Clear the _Blocks_ field.
Reset the version to "rawhide".
Close the bug as DEFERRED.
. **Close the Release Notes issue, if it exists.**
. **Re-run the Change processing scripts for the old and new target release.**
See the xref:pgm_guide/sop/changes.adoc#update_changeset[instructions].

This document outlines the process for managing xref:prioritized_bugs.adoc[prioritized bugs].


Meetings occur every two weeks.
Follow-up occurs weekly when priortized bugs exist.



The day before the meeting:

. Update the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/prioritized_bugs.txt[IRC script]
.. Add the link:++https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&f1=flagtypes.name&f2=OP&list_id=10626345&o1=substring&query_format=advanced&v1=fedora_prioritized_bug%3F++[nominated bugs]
.. Check the status of link:++https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&f1=flagtypes.name&f2=OP&list_id=10626381&o1=substring&query_format=advanced&v1=fedora_prioritized_bug%2B++[accepted bugs]
... Note any changes since the previous meeting
.. Note any acepted bugs closed since the last meeting in the "Bugs fixed since last meeting" section
.. Update the next meeting date
. Send an email with the agenda to triage@lists.fedoraproject.org and cc devel@lists.fedoraproject.org, test@lists.fedoraproject.org .
bcc the assignee of nominated and accepted bugs.
bcc the nominator of nominated bugs.

TIP: If there are no nominated bugs and the accepted bugs (if any) are not stuck, cancel the meeting.


. Follow the the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/prioritized_bugs.txt[IRC script]
. Try to achieve consensus on each decision
. Note decisions with the `#agreed` command


. For each nominated bug
.. Note the decision in a comment
.. For accepted bugs, set the `fedora_prioritized_bug` flag to `+`
.. For rejected bugs, set the `fedora_prioritized_bug` flag to `-`
. Update the table in xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.md[Friday's Fedora Facts]


Once a week, check that status of accepted bugs.
If no progress has been recorded in 1–2 weeks, nudge the assignee.
If bugs are stuck, send a summary email to the devel mailing list soliciting help.

Update the xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.md[Friday's Fedora Facts] table as appropriate.

This document describes the procedure for sending blocker status emails.
The email is intended to provide a high-level overview of release-blocking bugs.


Send weekly beginning after the upcoming release branches from Rawhide.
It is typically sent on Fridays, however this is not a hard requirement.


For each accepted and proposed blocker in the https://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs[BlockerBugs application] for the relevant milestone,

. Add a line to the table in xref:pgm_guide/sop/fridays_fedora_facts.adoc[Friday's Fedora Facts].
See that SOP for formatting instructions.
. In the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/blocker_email.txt[blocker_email.txt] file,
.. Add information in the bug-by-bug detail section
... First line: <#>. <component name> — <bug link> — <bug state>
... Second line: <bug title/summary>
... Third line: (blank)
... Subsequent lines: Include a brief summary of the behavior and key constraints.
Include the following, if appropriate:
.... Link to upstream bug or pull request
.... Updates that contain a candidate or verified fix
.. Add information in the action summary section
... First line: <#>. <component name> — <bug title/summary> — <bug state>
... Section line: ACTION: <action statement (see below)>
... Third line (if applicable): NEEDINFO: <person marked NEEDINFO in the bug>

When the information is fully collected, create the email message

. To: test@lists.fedoraproject.org, devel@lists.fedoraproject.org
. cc: (appropriate team mailing lists, if applicable)
. bcc: action-ed and needinfo-ed people (excluding upstream trackers)
. Open the body with a quick summary of schedule status.
For example, indicate the current target date.
. Include the contents of the blocker_email.txt afterward


Action statements generally take the form of "<person/group> to <action>."
You can write them however you want, but most will look like one of the following:

* When there's an upstream bug:
"Upstream to diagnose issue"
* When there's an upstream PR:
"Upstream to merge <PR ID>"
* When there's no upstream report and no diagnosis:
"Maintainers to diagnose issue"
* When there's a patch/PR or new upstream release:
"Maintainers to create an update with <patch/PR or upstream release>"
* When there's an update with a candidate fix:
"QA to verify <update ID>"
* When the bug is in VERIFIED state:
"(none)"
* When there's informating missing:
" "<person> to provide <missing info>"


The following is general advice.

* Don't worry about getting too deep into the technical aspects.
You're not there to diagnose issues.
* Update bugs if the state is inconsistent with reality.
(e.g. if an upstream PR exists, set it to POST)
* If you're short on time, skip the bugs that seem likely to be rejected.
* Remove the emails from the cc and bcc lines in the text file _before_ committing changes.

This document outlines procedures for the Spins keepalive process.
This process was https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1972[approved by the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee] to ensure that xref:releases::spins.adoc[Spins and Labs] are actively maintained.


The process begins **two weeks** before the Self-Contained Change proposal deadline.


1. Click the *New issue* button in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/schedule/[schedule repo].
2. Select '<spins_labs_keepalive>' as the issue template
3. Set `<Spin/Lab name> keepalive` as the issue title
4. Update the body of the ticket with the maintainer name, deadline date and Fedora Release #
5. Apply the *spins keepalive* tag, target release as the milestone and assign the ticket to the maintainer
5. Click *Create Issue*
6. Once all spins and labs keepalive requests are filed, send an email to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/spins%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[spins] mailing lists (update the date and release):
7. After one week, send a reminder email
8. At the deadline, send a final email
9. After one week post the deadline, send a notification email that the spin or lab will be dropped for this release and follow removal process.
10. File the respective tickets for dropped spins/labs (see removal process below)

NOTE: Ignore the Test Days spin.
It's useful to QA, but we don't release it publicly.



To notify maintainers that the keepalive deadline is coming up, the first step is to create keepalive tickets for each Spin/Lab as listed above. The ticket is templated so you need to just update the fields and tag the ticket correctly.
The email template to then send announcing the spins and labs keepalive requests is as follows:

....
FESco previously approved a requirement that Spin/Labs owners send a
keepalive request in order to keep building the spin or lab. I have
opened Pagure issues[1] for all Spins and Labs for this release[2].

If you are the owner of one of those spins and labs, please reply in
the appropriate ticket by <DATE>> to indicate the spin should
continue to be produced. If there is a spin or lab that does not have
an open ticket, please create one[3].

The reasoning for this is to not ship spins that are not actively
maintained. Future improvements to the release process that will allow
for teams to self-publish solutions will eventually remove the need
for these keepalives.

[1] https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/schedule/issues?status=Open&tags=spins+keepalive
[2] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/f<RELEASE>/spins/
[3] https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/schedule/new_issue
....



At the deadline, send this email to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce] and https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/spins%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[spins] mailing lists with a list of spins that have not been kept alive.

....
The following Spins/Labs maintainers have not indicated they wish to
continue producing the deliverables for the upcoming release. Any
that have not been adopted in one week will be dropped.

* <list of Spins/Labs>
....


One week after deadline, if=f there are still Spins/Labs that have not been adopted or had the current maintainer send a keepalive,

1. Open a https://pagure.io/releng/issues[Release Engineering issue] to have those deliverables removed.
2. Open a https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/issues[Websites issue] to remove the deliverables from the website for the release.

IMPORTANT: Submit the removal ticket before branch day so that the images are never produced for that release.

NOTE: Spins and Labs maintainers who engage in the keepalive ticket should file their own removal request or change of ownership PR, but it is always good practice to confirm with them that these steps are completed in the ticekt.


This document outlines procedures for processing inactive package maintainers.
FESCo https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2759[approved] a xref:fesco::Policy_for_inactive_packagers.adoc[policy for removing inactive packagers].
In concert with the xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc#_maintaining_provenpackager_status[Provenpackager policy], this policy is intended to reduce the risk of account compromise for inactive packagers.


This process occurs once per release.
The initial list of inactive packagers is created a week before Beta freeze.
Removal of inactive packagers happens a week after the final release.

We wait until after the final release to prevent orphaning packages near/during a freeze, which could be very unpleasant.


Both parts of the process require the https://pagure.io/find-inactive-packagers[find-inactive-packagers script].
By default, it will open issues in the https://pagure.io/find-inactive-packagers/issues[find-inactive-packagers repo].


. Generate a kerberos ticket with `fkinit -u <YOUR FEDORA ACCOUNT ID>`
. Set your https://pagure.io/settings#nav-api-tab[Pagure API key] with `export PAGURE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`
. Run `python3 find_inactive_packagers.py --privacy step-one --open-tickets` .
This opens Pagure tickets for each packager.
It also produces a `inactive_packagers.csv` file listing the inactive packagers it found.
. Send a list of inactive packagers to https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce].
See the template below.
. (optional) Run `python3 find-inactive-pacakgers.py check-impact`.
This will generate a list of pacakges that will be orphaned.
This uses open tickets.
It does not perform an additional check.
You can re-run it several times between steps 1 and 2 in order to keep an updated list.

....
In accordance with FESCo's Inactive Packager Policy[1], packagers that have been identified as inactive have a ticket in the find-inactive-packagers repo[2]. One week after the final release, packagers who remain inactive will be removed from the packager group. (Note that pagure.io is one of the systems checked for activity, so commenting on your ticket that you're still around will prevent you from showing up in the second round.)

If you have suggestions for improvement, look for the open feature issues[3] and file an issue in the find-inactive-packagers repo[4] if it's not there already.

For the curious, here are the stats from today's run:

<INSERT STATS FROM SCRIPT>

[1] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Policy_for_inactive_packagers/
[2] https://pagure.io/find-inactive-packagers/issues?tags=inactive_packager&status=Open
[3] https://pagure.io/find-inactive-packagers/issues?tags=feature
[4] https://pagure.io/find-inactive-packagers/new_issue
....


If the packager replies that they would like to keep packager status, close the ticket _Keep pacakger status_.

If the packager replies that they are okay with dropping their packager status, add the _asked_removal_ tag, but *do not close the ticket.*


. Run `python3 find-inactive-packagers.py step-two --close-tickets`.
This generates a `still_inactive.csv` file and closes active tickets appropriately.
. Open a https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues[Fedora Infrastructure ticket] to remove inactive packagers.

This document describes the process for identifying and removing inactive provenpackagers in accordance with xref:fesco::Provenpackager_policy.adoc#_maintaing_provenpackager_status[FESCo policy].


This process occurs once per release cycle, starting at or near the branch day.
It occurs in two parts.



. Generate a kerberos ticket with `fkinit -u <YOUR FEDORA ACCOUNT ID>`
. Run the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_scripts/blob/main/f/provenpackager/inactive_provenpackagers.py[inactive_provenpackagers.py script] from the pgm_scripts repo.
This script iterates over all members of the _provenpackagers_ group, so it may take a while.
Since it's a read-only operation, it's safe to re-run if it gets interrupted.
. Send an announcement of accounts identified as inactive using the template below.
Use the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce mailing list] in the _to:_ field and bcc the _@fedoraproject.org_ addresses of listed as inactive.

....
In accordance with FESCo policy[1], the following provenpackagers will
be submitted for removal in two weeks based on a lack of Koji builds
submitted in the last six months. If you received this directly, you
can reply off-list to indicate you should still be in the
provenpackager group.

Note that removal from this group is not a "punishment" or a lack of
appreciation for the work you have done. The intent of the process is
to ensure contributors with distro-wide package privileges are still
active and responsive. This process is done regularly at the branch
point in each release.

[1] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Provenpackager_policy/#_maintaining_provenpackager_status

<OUTPUT of inactive_provenpackagers.py script>
....


. Wait two weeks from the initial notification.
. File an https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues[issue with the Infrastructure team] listing the accounts to remove from the _provenpackagers_ group.

This document describes the procedures for publishing the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/[Friday's Fedora Facts] posts on the Fedora Community Blog.


Publish the post weekly on Friday (hence the name).
For ease of maintenance, update the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/pgm_communication/blob/main/f/fridays_fedora_facts.md[source file] throughout the week.

** Upcoming https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/[schedule] milestones
. **Collect calls for participation (CfPs).**
This is an h3 level.
Sources are listed in the markdown file.
Use your best judgment in determining what might be of broad interest to the Fedora community.
CfPs should be a table sorted by the CfP close date, ordered from soonest to latest.
The table has the following columns:
** Conference.
Includes the name and a link to the event website.
** Location.
Includes the city and country (use the 2-letter code).
Add the state if it takes places in the United States.
For online conferences, use "virtual" as the location.
For hybrid conferences, use the city and "and virtual".
** Date.
List day(s) of month followed by the three-letter month abbreviation.
Do not include the year.
** CfP.
Use "closes <date>" for CfPs with a defined close date.
Use "open" for CfPs with an ambiguous or unstated close date.
In that case, sort it based on a reasonable interpolation from event dates.
In all cases, link directly to the CfP portal or a page specifically describing the conference's CfP process.
. **Add help wanted calls.**
This is an h2 level.
Include the following:
** A link to https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/[open package review requests], and specificially call out the count awaiting a reviewer and the count needing a sponsor.
** A link to orphaned package or package retirement announcements from the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce mailing list].
** Community surveys if any are open.
** Other calls for help that you notice on mailing lists, Discussion, or in chat.
. **Add upcoming test days.**
This is an h3 level.
Comment it out if there are no active test days.
Add upcoming test days as an unordered list with the form "<date> — <subject>".
Include a link to a CommBlog announcement or wiki page, if available.
Sources include the https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/list/QA/[QA calendar] and the https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/issues?tags=test+days&status=Open["test days" label in the fedora-qa repo].

Keep the meetings at project-level interest.
For example: blocker reviews, Council, Mindshare, FESCo, prioritized bugs, Flock.
. **Add releases.**
This is an h2 level.
Generally, the only thing in this level should be a table of open bugs.
The open bugs table should list all supported and in-development releases (including Rawhide) with a count of open bugs.
. **Add prioritized bugs.**
This is an h3 level.
Include a link to the xref:prioritized_bugs.adoc[Prioritized Bugs process documentation].
List the bugs in a table with the following columns:
** Bug number (with a link to the bug in Bugzilla)
** Component
** Status
. **Add release-specific information.**
For each release where one of the following has content, include an h3 of "Fedora Linux <N>".
** Count open of Fails To Build From Source and Fails To Install bugs as an unordered list.
** Upcoming schedule milestones.
Only include important deadlines within the next 6–8 weeks.
List them as an unordered list in the form "**<date>** — <Milestone/deadline>" under an h4 of "Schedule".
** Changes.
List active change proposals in a table.
Remove proposals after publishing the FFF where they have reached a terminal state (approved, rejected, or withdrawn).
Link to the change set page and the tracking bug so readers can find approved proposals.
The table should have the following columns:
*** Proposal.
This is the title of the proposal with a link to the wiki page.
*** Type.

This is a table with the following columns:
*** Status.
The Bugzilla status.
*** Count.
The number of tracking bugs in that status.
** Blockers.
List all active blockers for the next release milestone, starting after branch day.
(You can choose to include final blockers prior to the beta release, if you feel like doing the work.)
List blockers in a table with the following columns:
*** Bug ID.
The Bugzilla number with a link to the Bugzilla bug.
*** Component.
The current component that the bug is filed against.

* Edit the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Election_Banner[election banner template] in the wiki to update the dates and current status
* Edit the link:../../elections[Elections docs page] to point to the current release's schedule
* Add a milestone for the release in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/settings#roadmap-tab[elections-interviews repo roadmap]
* Create tracking issues for each of the elections in the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/issues[elections-interviews repo].
These issues can be used to tie interview tickets to the specific election.


Open a ticket with each of Council, FESCo, EPEL and Mindshare Committee to see if they want to change the questions.
Include:

* The deadline for finalizing questions.
If they have not provided updated questions by the deadline, use the previous cycle's questions.
* The questions used in the previous cycle.


* Update wiki pages for each election
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council/Nominations[Council],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Development/SteeringCommittee/Nominations[FESCo],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mindshare/Nominations[Mindshare])
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mindshare/Nominations[EPEL]):
** Update any references to the version
** Update the list of ending terms
** Clear the candidates table
** Remove edit protection


* Publish a Community Blog post with:
** Links to the wiki pages
** Nomination deadline
** General information
** The "sticky" bit set

TIP: Copy the previous election's post with dates and versions updated.
The https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/f38-election-nominations-now-open/[F38 post] is a good example.

* Send an email with a link to the Community Blog post and a link to the wiki page(s) to:
** announce list (all elections)
** devel-announce list (FESCo election)
* Post to Fedora Discussion with a link to the Community Blog post and a link to the wiki page in the:
** `#council` tag (Council election)
** `#mindshare` tag (Mindshare election)

TIP: Halfway through the nomination period, nudge the emails (only devel) and Discussion threads to remind people of the nomination deadline.


This document outlines the procedure for closing the post-release election cycle.
This covers two parallel activities:
. Finalizing questions to use in interviews
. Closing the nomination period


This process happens two weeks after the elections are xref:pgm_guide/sop/elections-open.adoc[opened].


* If the number of candidates is greater than or equal to the number of open seats, set the nomination wiki pages to protected.
Otherwise, extend the nomination deadline _for that election only_ by one week.
Repeat until the number of candidates is greater than or equal to the number of open seats.
* Edit the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Election_Banner[election banner template] in the wiki to update the dates and current status
* Comment on the Council, FESCo, and Mindshare Committee tickets with the final questions that will be used.
* Update the `templates/*` files in the repo (ssh://git@pagure.io/tickets/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews.git) with the questions
* Email all candidates to inform them to submit their interviews
** Interviews are submitted to the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/issues[elections-interviews repo]
** Candidates who do not submit an interview by the deadline will not be on the ballot
* If the Community Blog post announcing nominations is set to "sticky", un-sticky it.

TIP: As a service to candidates, send regular reminders to anyone who has not yet submitted their interviews.

This document outlines the process for handing election interviews.


This process occurs when a candidate submits and interview.


* Ensure the "private" box is checked on the issue.
* Acknowledge the submission in the ticket.
You can use the canned response.
** Check if the candidate has an account in the Community Blog.
If they do not, add the `login needed` tag and include the log in request in the acknowledgement.
* Add the `interview` tag and set the milestone on the ticket.
* Add the appropriate election to the "Blocking" field.
* Add the issue link in the "ticket" column of the nomination wiki page.

When you are ready to add the interview to the Community Blog,

* Move the issue to the Processing column on the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/boards/Interviews[Interviews board].
* Create the Community Blog post
** Include FAS account, IRC/Matrix information, wiki page (see previous examples)
** Set the candidate as the author.
If the candidate has not yet logged in, use the "Fedora Project Community" account.
** Select the public preview option.
** Schedule the interview to post.
*** 15 minutes before the start of the voting period (Council candidate interviews)
*** 10 minutes before the start of the voting period (FESCo candidate interviews)
*** 5 minutes before the start of the voting period (Mindshare candidate interviews)
* Comment on the ticket to let the candidate know the post is available for review.
Provide the public preview URL.
* Add the URL in the "interview" column of the nomination wiki page.
* Move the issue to the Ready for Review column on the https://pagure.io/fedora-pgm/elections-interviews/boards/Interviews[Interviews board].

This document outlines the procedures for setting up the elections.


This process occurs the day before voting starts.


In the nomination pages on the wiki, strike through any candidates that did not submit an interview question.
If the number of candidates is less than the number of open seats, extend the deadline _for just that election_ by one week.
Repeat until the number of candidates is at least equal to the number of open seats.


The elections app runs on https://elections.fedoraproject.org[elections.fedoraproject.org].

* maximum range: # of candidates
* URL: link to wiki page with nominations
* Admin groups: automatically includes the elections group
* When adding users, add link to the interview on Community Blog
* Edit the link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Election_Banner[election banner template] in the wiki to update the dates and current status

NOTE: FESCo elections require that the `FPCA + 1` box be checked in the election setup.

WARNING: Do not put any groups in the "Legal voters groups" unless you intend to restrict voting to a specific group.
This field is not necessary for the regular elections.


* Create a Community Blog post that includes
** A link to the Elections app
** Links to all candidate interviews
* Set it to be sticky
* Schedule it to publish at the beginning of the voting period.


After the Community Blog post publishes, send announcements to:

* announce list (all elections)
* devel-announce list (FESCo election)
* `#council` tag on Discussion (Council election)
* `#mindshare` tag on Discussion (Mindshare election)

TIP: Halfway through the voting period, nudge the emails (only devel) and Discussion threads to remind people of the voting deadline.
