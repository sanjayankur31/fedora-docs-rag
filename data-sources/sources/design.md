1.  Join the Element Fedora Design [group
    chat](https://matrix.to/#/#design:fedoraproject.org).

2.  Introduce yourself to the group; talk about your art/design
    experience and interests so we'll know what kinds of design tasks
    you might be interested in helping out with.

3.  Sign up for a [Fedora
    Account](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/user),
    you'll need it later!

4.  Complete the [Fedora Project Contributor
    Agreement](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/fpca) (FPCA)
    through the [Account
    System](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/user).
    This will ensure that the contributions you make are properly
    licensed!

5.  Complete a small task to join the team. To find something to work
    on, you can do any of the following:

    - Claim and complete a design ticket at the [Fedora Design Issue
      Request
      queue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues).

    - Look at the [Fedora Design
      issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/design/team/-/issues),
      and see if any are flagged for newbies!

    - Ask the group in Element if there are any tickets that need
      attention. Note: We definitely recommend for folks starting out
      with our team to look for tasks that are not icon-related. Icon
      designs pose additional burdens and challenges that we don't want
      you to have to deal with just starting out! The same applies to
      logos.

6.  Once you've completed an initial draft of your design task, comment
    on the ticket, and pop the link or artwork in the [Element design
    group chat](https://matrix.to/#/#design:fedoraproject.org) for
    feedback and approval.

7.  Once your design is approved, send a message to the design team in
    Element requesting an invite to the design-team group. Provide your
    Fedora Account username so we can add you in.

After you have completed these steps, you can begin contributing to a
project as a full member of the design team. Questions and suggestions
may be asked within the ticket as well as the Fedora Design group chat
on Element.

Video meetings will be held every **Monday at 14:30 UTC** on
[**Jitsi**](https://meet.jit.si/FedoraDesign). Please note that audio
and video is not required to join the meeting - you can always use the
chat for input if that is more comfortable for you.

Check the [Design Calendar](https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/design)
for updated meeting times. Meeting logs can be found at
[meetbot.fedoraproject.org](https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/).

You can file an
[issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues/) to:

- Request new design work

- Tell us if something's wrong with an existing design

- Make a suggestion for a future design

Because this is mainly a volunteer-staffed team, we don't guarantee to
handle all tickets. If you think a ticket needs attention and would like
to work on it, but someone else took ownership of the ticket: try to
contact the owner and see if they are working on it. If you don't hear
from them within a week you can probably take the ticket over. If you
have a filed a ticket and have not heard from anyone, please feel free
to [join our chat](https://matrix.to/#/#design:fedoraproject.org) for
attention / guidance / support.
