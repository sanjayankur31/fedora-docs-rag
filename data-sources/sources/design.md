# Getting Started {#_getting_started}

1.  Join the Element Fedora Design [group
    chat](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;design:fedoraproject.org).

2.  Introduce yourself to the group; talk about your art/design
    experience and interests so we'll know what kinds of design tasks
    you might be interested in helping out with.

3.  Sign up for a [Fedora
    Account](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/user),
    you'll need it later!

4.  Complete the [Fedora Project Contributor
    Agreement](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/fpca) (FPCA)
    through the [Account
    System](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/user).
    This will ensure that the contributions you make are properly
    licensed!

5.  Complete a small task to join the team. To find something to work
    on, you can do any of the following: &#42; Claim and complete a
    design ticket at the [Fedora Design Issue Request
    queue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues).
    &#42; Look at the [Fedora Design
    issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/design/team/-/issues), and
    see if any are flagged for newbies! &#42; Ask the group in Element
    if there are any tickets that need attention. Note: We definitely
    recommend for folks starting out with our team to look for tasks
    that are not icon-related. Icon designs pose additional burdens and
    challenges that we don't want you to have to deal with just starting
    out! The same applies to logos.

6.  Once you've completed an initial draft of your design task, comment
    on the ticket, and pop the link or artwork in the [Element design
    group chat](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;design:fedoraproject.org)
    for feedback and approval.

7.  Once your design is approved, send a message to the design team in
    Element requesting an invite to the design-team group. Provide your
    Fedora Account username so we can add you in.

After you have completed these steps, you can begin contributing to a
project as a full member of the design team. Questions and suggestions
may be asked within the ticket as well as the Fedora Design group chat
on Element.

## Filing an issue {#_filing_an_issue}

You can file an
[issue](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/requests/-/issues/) to:

&#42; Request new design work &#42; Tell us if something's wrong with an
existing design &#42; Make a suggestion for a future design

## Now what? {#_now_what}

Because this is mainly a volunteer-staffed team, we don't guarantee to
handle all tickets. If you think a ticket needs attention and would like
to work on it, but someone else took ownership of the ticket: try to
contact the owner and see if they are working on it. If you don't hear
from them within a week you can probably take the ticket over. If you
have a filed a ticket and have not heard from anyone, please feel free
to [join our
chat](https://matrix.to/&#35;/&#35;design:fedoraproject.org) for
attention / guidance / support.
