Fedora Project participates in multiple mentored project programs and is
actively looking for new mentors, projects and programs that fit the
criteria and can help the project/community grow.

Two main programs that the Fedora Project has been a part of for a long
time are

&#42; [Google Summer of Code](gsoc/2021/index.xml) &#42;
[Outreachy](outreachy/2020/index.xml)

# Roles {#_roles}

What are the different roles that people can play in the mentored
projects workflow?

&#42; Intern. &#42; Mentor. &#42;&#42; Pitching a project &#42;&#42;
Joining an existing project &#42; Program manager. &#42; Mentored
project coordinator.

# How to get from a 'project idea' to 'running an internship with Fedora'? {#_how_to_get_from_a_project_idea_to_running_an_internship_with_fedora}

## Want to be an intern with Fedora project? {#_want_to_be_an_intern_with_fedora_project}

Intern application process varies from project to project. Please refer
to *some fedora page* to check the existing programs where Fedora is
participating.

## Want to be a mentor? {#_want_to_be_a_mentor}

In Fedora there are 2 kind of mentors.

&#42; Who guide mentees and work with them on the project. To mentor a
project, you need to first contact the Mindshare/mentored-projects team
by creating an issue on the mentored-projects gitlab. Please, check the
project elegibility criteria defined by Fedora community. &#42; Who
coordinate the programs. They collaborate closely with Mindshare
committee. They are responsible to provide proper communication with
interns, project mentors, ensuring feedback/evaluation submission and
ensure project mentors are following Fedora community guidelines.

## Want to propose a project? {#_want_to_propose_a_project}

In order to propose a project, follow these steps.

&#42; Check the existing programs where Fedora project is participating.
*link to a webpage* &#42; Check the eligibility criteria for running a
project under Fedora. &#42; Mentoring is a time consuming activity and
is not meant to reduce your project workload. When volunteering as a
mentor, you are committing time and effort to guide and help a newcomer.
&#42; Open an issue on *mentored-projects gitlab* and choose the
template for the program you consider is a good fit for your project.

# Eligibility criteria used for running a project under Fedora {#_eligibility_criteria_used_for_running_a_project_under_fedora}

Fedora project will evaluate all the projects proposed and will use the
following criteria to accept or reject them. A project should meet one
of the following criteria:

&#42; The project is directly related to Fedora project &#42;&#42;
Fedora branding with the project &#42;&#42; We use the project to build
our operating system &#42;&#42; We use the project inside by Fedora
project &#42; The project is heavily used by Fedora project &#42; The
project provides a direct benefit to Fedora project

# Interns onboarding process {#_interns_onboarding_process}

Note: This process is to enable summer coding participants to
communicate with the community \| With Mindshare, I mean Mindshare:
Mentored project representative hereafter

&#42; Within two weeks of announcing accepted students (by Google Summer
of Code and Outreachy committee), Mindshare coordinates with mentors,
students, and general mentors to publish intern introduction blog posts
on the community blog for the respective programs.

&#42; Mentors ensure that Students are posting a post every 2-3 weeks
once the coding period starts. (Can we use fedocal to set reminder and
send an email to the summer-coding/outreachy list? - needs discussion)

\+ The post should ideally contain

&#42;&#42; Community Interaction &#42;&#42; Project updates/roadmaps
&#42;&#42; Challenges/success &#42;&#42; Other things they want to share

&#42; Summer coding showcase session in Flock/One of the monthly Council
calls

&#42; Post coding period, Mindshare to publish a magazine post with:
&#42;&#42; Outcomes of the GSoC/Outreachy projects &#42;&#42; Fedora
participation in outreach programs &#42;&#42; Reflection &#42;&#42;
Links to the interns\' work &#42;&#42; What's Next: (Ideas and Call for
participation)

&#42; Google Summer of Code &#42;&#42; 2025

# Google Summer of Code 2025

:::: note
::: title
:::

Fedora is proud to have been accepted as a GSoC mentoring organization.
Student applications open on March 24, 2025 1800UTC. Please make sure
you carefully read through the [general
information](gsoc/2025/index.xml) and [application
process](gsoc/2025/application.xml) pages before applying.
::::

![gsoc logo](gsoc_logo.png)

This page contains information about Fedora's participation in Google
Summer of Code (GSoC). Please feel free to contact us via the mailing
list below for clarifications and more information. You can also use the
IRC channel.

## What can I do today?

Fedora is still in the process of applying to be a mentoring
organization. Today there is nothing we can do except wait until Google
makes a decision.

Today you should read through the [ideas](gsoc/2025/ideas.xml) and think
about our [application process.](gsoc/2025/application.xml)

## Student Information

Do you want to contribute to one of the world's leading innovative Linux
distributions? GSoC could be your chance. Please refer to the
information below.

&#42; If you're interested in working on a mentor-submitted idea, read
the [ideas page](gsoc/2025/ideas.xml) and about the project and the
related technology. There is no need to contact the mentor unless you
have a specific question about the project. Don't send an \'I'm
interested\' email.

&#42; You may also wish to start working on the Fedora specific parts of
the application, see below for more information. Carefully review the
student responsibilities section.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS?

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora?

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
you to get started.

&#42; [Fedora Project
Overview](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/project/fedora-overview.html)

IRC](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC) &#42; [Information
about Development in Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Development)

### Student Responsibilities

You are the key ingredient for your project's success. This project is
important to you, your mentor, and the entire Fedora Community.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Communicating early and often with your mentor. &#42; Blogging
every week about what you're learning, how you're doing, challenges and
successes. This is key way to keep the entire Fedora Community informed.
&#42; Working with your mentor on realistic achievable milestones that
provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Attending the brief
student calls, as announced &#42; Being accountable for your success and
your actions

### Student Application

Please read and follow the [student application
process](gsoc/2025/application.xml).

## Mentor Information

Want to help the next generation of contributors grow? Want to bring new
contributors to Fedora? Want to advance your projects along their
roadmap? GSoC can be a chance to do all of this.

:::: note

If you are contacted directly by a student, we encourage you to reply
and include the mailing list and/or IRC channel to keep the process
transparent and to ensure the inquiry is able to be answered by more
people than just you.
::::

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://gitlab.com/fedora/mentoring/home) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

&#42; What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a
project for proposal from [ideas list](gsoc/2025/ideas.xml). While it is
possible to propose your own project, it is often more successful for
you to select one that is already proposed by a mentor.

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email.

&#42; About You - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any
past involvement with the Fedora Project or another open-source project
as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and
non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls,
etc.) &#42;&#42; What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates
you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you
organize your work.

&#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you want to
work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with?

&#42; Why This Project? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which
specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project,
do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits
the community. &#42;&#42; Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for
the project? &#42;&#42; What relevant experience do you have for this
project? &#42;&#42; What do you want to gain from this project?
&#42;&#42; Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

&#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?

&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

&#42; What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are
periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

:::: note
::: title
:::

You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with
your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the
information from the supplemental application requirements section
below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if
any.

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project_2}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project_2}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

Ideas are subject to change as additional mentors are onboarded.
::::

&#42; &lt;&lt;Use natural language to create network
configuration&gt;&gt; &#42; &lt;&lt;Make AI understand NetworkManager
logs&gt;&gt;

### Genric Intro {#_genric_intro}

NetworkManager is the standard Linux network configuration tool suite.
It supports a large range of networking setups, from desktop to servers
and mobile and integrates well with popular desktop environments and
server configuration management tools.

Nmstate is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages
host networking settings in a declarative manner. The networking state
is described by a pre-defined schema. Reporting of current state and
changes to it (desired state) both conform to the schema.

Linux System Roles is a project related to Ansible, a tool for
automating configuration management, application deployment and software
provisioning. The goal of linux system roles is to provide a consistent
user interface, abstracting from any particular implementation of the
linux subsystems, but trying to get the most out of the particular
libraries on each one of them. The Network Linux System Role currently
provides a unique configuration interface for network-scripts and
NetworkManager.

The topic for this internship is enhancing this ecosystem with AI
capabilities to improve the user experience for these projects. Possible
areas are:

#### Use natural language to create network configuration {#_use_natural_language_to_create_network_configuration}

- Difficulty : Easy

- Type : 1person full time 350hrs (12 weeks)

- Technology : ML, AI, git, python, shell, linux, networking, md(for
  docs)

- Mentor : Fernando F. Mancera (Current NetworkManager Developer and
  Maintainer), Wen Liang , Iñigo Huguet

- Email : <ffmancera@riseup.net>, <wenliang@redhat.com>,
  <ihuguet@redhat.com>(as backup)

##### Description {#_description_3}

While it is rather easy for users to describe in natural language what
they would like to configure, it can be hard to find the right options
or using the right syntax in configuration files. AI provides a way to
use natural language. As part of the internship, the projects should be
enhanced to provide user support TUI based on prompts such as "Configure
network devices eth0 and eth1 in a linux bridge".

##### Read Me {#_read_me}

<https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network>
<https://fedoramagazine.org/writing-useful-terminal-tui-on-linux-with-dialog-and-jq/>

##### Deliverables {#_deliverables_3}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Get in touch with the Upstream (Fedora and NM)

- Basic ML/AL and LLM knowledge is preffered. Learn more

- Building a custom LLM which will be trained with dataset of NM and
  NMstate

- Build TUI for prompt and output

- Write documentation

- Python tests and CI automation

#### Make AI understand NetworkManager logs {#_make_ai_understand_networkmanager_logs}

- Difficulty : Easy

- Type : 1 person full time 350hrs (12 weeks)

- Technology : ML, AI, git, python, shell, linux, networking, md(for
  docs)

- Mentor : Fernando F. Mancera (Current NetworkManager Developer and
  Maintainer), Wen Liang , Iñigo Huguet

- Email : <ffmancera@riseup.net>, <wenliang@redhat.com>,
  <ihuguet@redhat.com>(as backup)

##### Description {#_description_4}

AI summarizer or abstract generation is widely deployed and utilized in
various applications, which saves people's time from reading lengthy or
even garbled text.

Analyzing the NetworkManager log is hard for new developers or users,
sometimes it is time-consuming to summarize the networking behavior from
the NetworkManager log. With the assistance of an AI summarizer, we
should expect the model to parse and understand the NM log, and give a
summary of the networking behavior with a confidence score and the
verbose level of the summary can also be easily controlled. With the
assistance of this TUI tool, the developers and users can analyze the
NetworkManager log more easily.

Interested in applying for Google Summer of Code with Fedora? Here is
how you do that!

The following are specific guidelines for students to use to submit an
application for the GSoC program through the Fedora Project. Please go
through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete
by the deadline. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Important {#_important_2}

&#42; Timelines are set by Google for the entire program. [Follow the
timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/). &#42;
Applications are due in Google's system by Feb 6 18:00 UTC. &#42;
Applications Must be filed in the Google system. No other material can
be read or accepted. &#42; The final application is required to be
submitted as a PDF.

## Student Application Process {#_student_application_process_2}

### Learn {#_learn_2}

Before you do anything, learn about the program and Fedora. These links
may be helpful:

&#42; [GSoC official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) &#42;
[Information about Fedora's Participation in GSoC](index.html)

### Communicate {#_communicate_2}

Begin
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
with the community. Our community members can help you understand the
existing project proposals. If you're going to try and propose your own
project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and
find a mentor.

&#42; [the summer-coding
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org)
&#42; [the development
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org).

Don't forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn
more. If you're going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the
time of proposal.

### Apply {#_apply_2}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Fedora is applying to be mentoring Organization. Student applications
open on March 9, 2021.
::::

The application process consists of 5 steps:

1.  Create a FAS account [FAS Account Signup / Login
    Page](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts)

2.  Join the fedora-summer-coding mailing list [Fedora Summer Coding
    Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    This list is fairly low volume.

3.  Join the devel mailing list [Devel Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
    appropriately.

4.  Sign the FPCA by following the directions
    [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System/CompleteFPCA)

5.  Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the
    next section at the [Google Summer of Code
    Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/). We strongly
    encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback
    about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback.
The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and
provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you must find a mentor.
Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key
to doing this. If you don't want to share your proposal publicly
consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the
mentor/reviewers. You can also share the link via a private ticket in
our [Pagure Repository](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues).
While we would normally not suggest a close-sourced tool such as Google
Docs, in this case it is potentially easier for you because you a) must
have a Google account to be able to apply to the program; and b) must
generate a PDF for your application.

#### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements {#_google_summer_of_code_application_and_supplemental_material_requirements_2}

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

&#42; What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a
project for proposal from [ideas list](gsoc/2024/ideas.xml). While it is
possible to propose your own project, it is often more successful for
you to select one that is already proposed by a mentor.

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email.

&#42; About You - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any
past involvement with the Fedora Project or another open-source project
as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and
non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls,
etc.) &#42;&#42; What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates
you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you
organize your work.

&#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you want to
work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with?

&#42; Why This Project? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which
specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project,
do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits
the community. &#42;&#42; Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for
the project? &#42;&#42; What relevant experience do you have for this
project? &#42;&#42; What do you want to gain from this project?
&#42;&#42; Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

&#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?

&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

&#42; What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are
periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

:::: note
::: title
:::

You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with
your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the
information from the supplemental application requirements section
below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if
any.

We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF.
Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however
all information must be readable.
::::

### Keep communicating {#_keep_communicating_2}

We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and
listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your
proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other
contributors are often very busy people.

The Fedora Project will be applying as a mentoring organization in GSoC
2022.
::::

![gsoc logo](gsoc_logo.png)

This page contains information about Fedora's participation in Google
Summer of Code (GSoC). Please feel free to contact us via the mailing
list below for clarifications and more information. You can also use the
IRC channel.

## What can I do today? {#what-can-i-do-today}

The Fedora Project is still in the process of applying to be a mentoring
organization. Today there is nothing we can do except wait until Google
makes a decision.

## Student Information {#student-information}

Do you want to contribute to one of the world's leading innovative Linux
distributions? GSoC could be your chance. Please refer to the
information below.

&#42; If you're interested in working on a mentor-submitted idea, Check
tickets on [our project idea
tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=project-idea&amp;tags=GSoC&amp;close_status=).
There is no need to contact the mentor unless you have a specific
question about the project. Don't send an \'I'm interested\' email.

&#42; If you're interested in proposing your own project, check [Call
for Projects and Mentors: GSoC
2022](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/call-for-projects-and-mentors-gsoc-2022/)

&#42; You may also wish to start working on the Fedora specific parts of
the application, see below for more information. Carefully review the
student responsibilities section.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
you to get started.

    This list is fairly low volume.

3.  Join the devel mailing list [Devel Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
    appropriately.

4.  Sign the FPCA by logging in [FAS Account Signup / Login
    Page](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/accounts)

5.  Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the
    next section at the [Google Summer of Code
    Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/). We strongly
    encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback
    about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback.
The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and
provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you must find a mentor.
Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key
to doing this. If you don't want to share your proposal publicly
consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the
mentor/reviewers. You can also share the link via a private ticket in
our [Pagure Repository](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues).
While we would normally not suggest a close-sourced tool such as Google
Docs, in this case it is potentially easier for you because you a) must
have a Google account to be able to apply to the program; and b) must
generate a PDF for your application.

#### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements {#_google_summer_of_code_application_and_supplemental_material_requirements_3}

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

1.  What project are you applying to?

2.  Contact Information

    c.  Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
        you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

    d.  Propose a rough schedule/roadmap for this project. Ideally you
        will have regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

7.  What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
    university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there
    are periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are
    better at accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

# Google Summer of Code 2021 {#google-summer-of-code-2021}

:::: note
::: title
:::

The Fedora Project was not selected as a mentoring organization in GSoC
2021.
::::

![gsoc logo](gsoc_logo.png)

This page contains information about Fedora's participation in Google
Summer of Code (GSoC). Please feel free to contact us via the mailing
list below for clarifications and more information. You can also use the
IRC channel.

## What can I do today? {#what-can-i-do-today}

Fedora is still in the process of applying to be a mentoring
organization. Today there is nothing we can do except wait until Google
makes a decision.

Today you should read through the [ideas](gsoc/2021/ideas.xml) and think
about our [application process.](gsoc/2021/application.xml)

## Student Information {#student-information}

Do you want to contribute to one of the world's leading innovative Linux
distributions? GSoC could be your chance. Please refer to the
information below.

&#42; If you're interested in working on a mentor-submitted idea, read
the [ideas page](gsoc/2021/ideas.xml) and about the project and the
related technology. There is no need to contact the mentor unless you
have a specific question about the project. Don't send an \'I'm
interested\' email.

&#42; If you're interested in proposing your own project start looking
around the Fedora Project for a mentor and send your idea to the mailing
list or post it on the wiki. A list of potential mentors is also on the
[ideas page](gsoc/2021/ideas.xml).

&#42; You may also wish to start working on the Fedora specific parts of
the application, see below for more information. Carefully review the
student responsibilities section.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
you to get started.

IRC](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC) &#42; [Information
about Development in Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Development)

### Student Responsibilities {#student-responsibilities}

You are the key ingredient for your project's success. This project is
important to you, your mentor, and the entire Fedora Community.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Communicating early and often with your mentor. &#42; Blogging
every week about what you're learning, how you're doing, challenges and
successes. This is key way to keep the entire Fedora Community informed.
&#42; Working with your mentor on realistic achievable milestones that
provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Attending the brief
student calls, as announced &#42; Being accountable for your success and
your actions

### Student Application {#student-application}

Please read and follow the [student application
process](gsoc/2021/application.xml).

## Mentor Information {#mentor-information}

Want to help the next generation of contributors grow? Want to bring new
contributors to Fedora? Want to advance your projects along their
roadmap? GSoC can be a chance to do all of this.

transparent and to ensure the inquiry is able to be answered by more
people than just you.

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project_3}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project_3}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

&#42; &lt;&lt;Fedora QA Dashboard&gt;&gt; &#42; &lt;&lt;KiwiTCMS
integration with Fedora QA workflow&gt;&gt;

### Fedora QA Dashboard {#_fedora_qa_dashboard}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Javascript, React, HTML5, CSS3

- Mentor : Lukas Brabec , Josef

- Email : <lbrabec@redhat.com>, <jskladan@redhat.com> (as backup)

#### Description {#_description_5}

Fedora QA dashboard is an idea of a web application that would be the
landing page for QA related activities. The current state, as we see it,
is that we have tons of helpful documents, tools, and processes, but
these are scattered, or sometimes hard to reach/understand without some
preliminary knowledge. We identified this as the major obstacle in
bootstrapping new members of the community. Goal for this project is
making the learning curve less steep. We have basic PoC, that could
serve as a base to build from, or an inspiration for a rework.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_5}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Code of single-page application in javascript

- Buildable dockerfile, so the app can be deployed in our openshift
  cluster

- Share monthly reports to the community blog and QA meetings

### KiwiTCMS integration with Fedora QA workflow {#_kiwitcms_integration_with_fedora_qa_workflow}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Container basics, JSON-RPC API

- Mentor : Alex Todorov (Kiwi TCMS project lead),Sumantro Mukherjee (QA
  team)

- Email : <atodorov@otb.bg>, <sumukher@redhat.com>

#### Description {#_description_6}

Kiwi TCMS has been in talks for Fedora QA since sometime. Last year,
Fedora team members made a POC run to a KiwiTCMS instance for sometime.
However, the whole idea was to run it and test the viability of Kiwi
TCMS becoming a default TCMS for Fedora. As a initial part of the POC
efforts, QA identified a few missing pieces which become obstruction to
having Kiwi TCMS as our go to TCMS.

- Develop and integrate plugin for FAS/AAA AKA noggin for Authentication

- Integrate bugzilla with the workflow

- Add functionality for submission of anonymous result submission

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_6}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Finishing the Authentication plugin

- Build, test and deploy the TCMS and update as community reviews

- Share monthly reports to the community blog and QA meetings

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project_4}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project_4}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

&lt;&lt;Dashboard for Packit&gt;&gt; &#42; &lt;&lt;Improve Network Linux
System Role&gt;&gt; &#42; &lt;&lt;Add varlink support to Nmstate&gt;&gt;

### Packit can work with Gitlab {#_packit_can_work_with_gitlab}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Flask, Container basics, REST API

- Mentor : Frantisek Lachman

- IRC &amp; Email : Frantisek Lachman \[IRC: lachmanfrantisek,
  <flachman@redhat.com>\]

#### Description {#_description_7}

Packit (<https://packit.dev/>) project has native support exclusively
for GitHub now. There were numerous requests from the community to add
support for GitLab as well. So here we are - are you up for the
challenge to implement support for GitLab in packit-service
(<https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service>) so that it can
process events from GitLab API and return feedback of successful builds
or failed tests back into the merge request? Please bear in mind that
GitLab and GitHub use slightly different workflows (pipelines vs.
external CI systems) so design work needs to be done before writing
code.

Resources can be found at Upstream tracking issue:
<https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/249>

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_7}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

&#42; Code in Packit service repository which makes packit understand
the gitlab events &#42; Packit is able to talk to a GitLab server API
and: &#42;&#42; Comment on merge request &#42;&#42; Report check results
(builds, tests) &#42; On-board at least a single project from GNOME
gitlab instance (<https://gitlab.gnome.org/explore/groups>) to use
packit.

### Dashboard for Packit {#_dashboard_for_packit}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Flask, Container basics, REST API, webdesign (CSS
  &amp; javascript)

- Mentor : Hunor Csomortáni

- IRC &amp; Email : Hunor Csomortáni \[IRC: csomh,
  csomh₊<gsoc@redhat.com>\]

#### Description {#_description_8}

Packit project currently has an extremely basic dashboard
(<https://github.com/packit-service/dashboard/>) with very little
information in it. We'd love to have more tables, more data, charts and
all the shiny stuff, in order to make it easier to get an insight of how
the service operates and how users interact with it.

We're looking for these views:

- Listing for recent build and test runs

- The same listing but per project

- A chart of usage - how many tasks are executed in a given time of a
  day

- Details for projects and builds

This task has a challenge - our API doesn't provide most of the data
needed to accomplish this. So the expectation here is to work with the
upstream project (us) to come up with a final design, provide the data
and develop the dashboard.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_8}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Code in packit-service/dashboard with the functionality

- OpenShift templates and Ansible playbooks in
  packit-service/dashboard,deployment so that we can deploy it in our
  openshift cluster

- Tests to verify that the proposed code works

- The updated dashboard deployed in production

### Improve Network Linux System Role {#_improve_network_linux_system_role}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Ansible

- Mentor : Till Maas, Thomas Haller

- IRC &amp; Email : tyll, till q redhat.com / thaller, thaller q
  redhat.com

#### Description {#_description_9}

The Network Linux System Role provides a uniform configuration interface
for network-scripts and NetworkManager. In this project, the role would
be improved. There are several areas that could be selected by an intern
depending on their interest:

&#42; Add support for more interfaces/options, this includes the
following tasks . Write missing tests/documentation for open PRs to
finalize them . Add support for wake-on-lan options:
<https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/150> . Add proper
support for team and make the configuration more uniform with bonding

&#42; Improve the testing framework . Write an integration test to
become familiar with the role, for example for
<https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/124> . Make the
tests more uniform (they developed over the time. Adjust old tests to
use the conventions of newer tests) . Add support to test the ansible
module directly via pytest instead of only via ansible-playbook .
Simplify test playbooks by writing custom Ansible modules that simplify
test setup/preparation and assertions

&#42; Network state management (most difficult) . Support to update only
partial settings . Return the current network configuration . Initially
only the configuration files . Maybe also the runtime state

&#42; What are we looking for: . Interest in writing high-quality code
in Python for Ansible . Personal accountability with regular, clear and
open communication . Ability to independently transfer feedback into
code . Support for more features or a better test framework . Effective
collaboration via GitHub, IRC and video conferences

&#42; Notes &amp; references: .
<https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/> . Current tests:
<https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/tree/master/tests>

### Add varlink support to Nmstate {#_add_varlink_support_to_nmstate}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Linux shell, REST api, LInux Networking (basic)

- Mentor : Fernando Fernandez Mancera, Till Maas (Helping with
  mentoring) and Gris Ge (Helping with mentoring).

- IRC &amp; Email :ffmancera, <ferferna@redhat.com>

#### Description {#_description_10}

Nmstate is a python library (libnmstate) and a command line tool
(nmstatectl) that manages host networking settings in a declarative
manner. <https://nmstate.github.io/>

There are some users that want to run nmstate in systems that do not
have or do not support python. In order to solve this issue, the student
would implement the varlink support to use nmstate from other languages.
<https://varlink.org/>

Till have implemented a Proof of Concept for this task so the user is
able to use it to understand how varlink works and how to proceed.
<https://github.com/tyll/varlink-nmstate>

Ideally, kubernetes-nmstate should be updated to use varlink. This is
not a must.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_9}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Code of the varlink nmstate support

- Basic usage documentation (User README)

- Code documentation (Not very detailed, just general comments on how is
  the code structured)

through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete
by the deadline. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Important {#_important_5}

&#42; Timelines are set by Google for the entire program. Follow the
timeline. &#42; Applications are due in Google's system by March 31st,
2020 18:00 (UTC). &#42; Applications Must be filed in the Google system.
No other material can be read or accepted. &#42; The final application
is required to be submitted as a PDF.

## Student Application Process {#_student_application_process_5}

### Learn {#_learn_5}

Before you do anything, learn about the program and Fedora. These links
may be helpful:

&#42; [GSoC official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) &#42;
[Information about Fedora's Participation in GSoC](index.html)

### Communicate {#_communicate_5}

Begin
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
with the community. Our community members can help you understand the
existing project proposals. If you're going to try and propose your own
project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and
find a mentor.

&#42; [the summer-coding
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org)
&#42; [the development
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org).

Don't forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn
more. If you're going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the
time of proposal.

### Apply {#_apply_5}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Fedora is proud to have been accepted as a GSoC mentoring organization.
Student applications open on March 16, 2020.
::::

The application process consists of 5 steps:

1.  Create a FAS account [FAS Account Signup / Login
    Page](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts)

2.  Join the fedora-summer-coding mailing list [Fedora Summer Coding
    Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    This list is fairly low volume.

3.  Join the devel mailing list [Devel Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
    appropriately.

4.  Sign the FPCA by following the directions
    [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System/CompleteFPCA)

5.  Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the
    next section at the [Google Summer of Code
    Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/). We strongly
    encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback
    about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback.
The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and
provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you must find a mentor.
Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key
to doing this. If you don't want to share your proposal publicly
consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the
mentor/reviewers. You can also share the link via a private ticket in
our [Pagure Repository](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues).
While we would normally not suggest a close-sourced tool such as Google
Docs, in this case it is potentially easier for you because you a) must
have a Google account to be able to apply to the program; and b) must
generate a PDF for your application.

#### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements {#_google_summer_of_code_application_and_supplemental_material_requirements_5}

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

&#42; What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a
project for proposal from [ideas list](gsoc/2020/ideas.xml). While it is
possible to propose your own project, it is often more successful for
you to select one that is already proposed by a mentor.

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email.

&#42; About You - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any
past involvement with the Fedora Project or another open-source project
as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and
non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls,
etc.) &#42;&#42; What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates
you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you
organize your work.

&#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you want to
work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with?

&#42; Why This Project? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which
specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project,
do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits
the community. &#42;&#42; Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for
the project? &#42;&#42; What relevant experience do you have for this
project? &#42;&#42; What do you want to gain from this project?
&#42;&#42; Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

&#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?

&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

&#42; What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are
periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

:::: note
::: title
:::

You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with
your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the
information from the supplemental application requirements section
below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if
any.

We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF.
Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however
all information must be readable.
::::

### Keep communicating {#_keep_communicating_5}

We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and
listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your
proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other
contributors are often very busy people.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
you to get started.

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project_5}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project_5}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

  <vsiddhar@redhat.com>\]

#### Description {#_description_11}

The CentOS Project runs a public CI resource that is available to all
infra and infra related open source projects to come and consume. The
problem is that the signup process is very manual, both for the incoming
user and the CICO admins. CentOS CI is powered by OKD
(<https://okd.io>), and we would like to have a web application that
handles the login, Admin approval, and OKD project creation (from a
template) steps and also displays links to active CICO namespaces.

Fedora has an android app which lets a user browse the magazine, Fedora
Ask, browse the calendar etc within it.

Repo: <https://pagure.io/Fedora-app>

Goals :

- Make the app available on other platforms

- Implement new integrations based on community interest

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_11}

- Search and integrate with more Fedora services

### Fedora Gooey Karma {#_fedora_gooey_karma}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python, Rest API, Packaging

- Mentor : Sumantro Mukherjee \[<Sumantro@redhat.com>\]

#### Description {#_description_13}

The Fedora QA team is seeking help to fix tooling which enables testers
and lot of contributors post karmas against updates. Fedora uses Bodhi
to track the positiveness or negativeness of a package with respect to
its functionality and overall system performance. The student will be
working to refactor and rewrite the tool from scratch if required.
Currently, the code is hosted at
<https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/fedora-gooey-karma>

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_12}

As a GSoC intern, you will be responsible for the following :

- Look for Community Feedback and work on features

- Application ported to Bodhi2 API and Python3

- Revamp the UI built with QT

- Package and ship

### Change management tool {#_change_management_tool}

- Technology : Python, REST, HTML, CSS

- Mentor : [Ben Cotton](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bcotton)

- IRC &amp; Email : bcotton \| <bcotton@fedoraproject.org>

#### Description {#_description_14}

Fedora's Change process currently involves a lot of manual work to move
proposals through the process. Information is copy/pasted into a variety
of platforms, which is tedious and error-prone.

What are we looking for:

- Work with Fedora Program Manager to fit scripts to Change process

- Work with FESCo, FPL, and community members to determine what reports
  are useful

Resources :

- [Change Process](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Policy)

- [Update
  Process](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bcotton/UsePagureForChanges)

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_13}

As a GSoC intern, you would write a Python script or scripts that would:

- Pull data from the Change source (a Taiga board or Pagure issue, TBD)
  and send email

- Submit issues to other appropriate trackers (e.g. FESCo for approval)

- Update Change source with current state of proposal

- Produce static HTML reports

### Podman Container SECCOMP generation tool {#_podman_container_seccomp_generation_tool}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Golang, Containers, Podman, Linux

- Mentor : Dan Walsh, Valentin Rothberg

#### Contact {#_contact}

- Dan Walsh \[IRC: dwalsh, mail: <dwalsh@redhat.com>, twitter: rhatdan,
  github: rhatdan\],

- Valentin Rothberg \[IRC: vrothberg, mail: <rothberg@redhat.com>,
  twitter: vlntnrthbrg, github: vrothberg\]

#### Description {#_description_15}

Most containers currently have a hard-coded default seccomp profile,
that is pretty loose and meant to support a wide range of use-cases. The
idea of this project is to build a tool that would watch all of the
syscalls made within a container, and generate a seccomp profile for
this specific container to further harden security. We would want to add
a command to the Pod Manager (Podman) tool to basically launch the
container and then collect a set of syscalls either through strace, or
auditing, or similar tracing technologies.

Repo : <https://github.com/containers/libpod>

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_14}

As a GSoC intern you will be responsible for :

- Engage in community discussions

- Research how syscalls for a given workload (i.e., container) can be
  automatically traced (e.g., via strace)

- Implement a prototype based on Podman

- Collaborate with the mentors and the community to integrate the
  functionality upstream

### Release-bot {#_release_bot}

- Difficulty : Intermediate

- Technology : Python

- Mentor : Rado Pitonak \[IRC rpitonak, mail: <rpitonak@redhat.com>\] ,
  Tomas Tomecek \[IRC ttomecek, mail: <ttomecek@redhat.com>\]

#### Description {#_description_16}

Release-bot helps upstream maintainers deliver their software to users,
via automated releases at GitHub and PyPI. Right now there are many ways
how workflow of release-bot can be improved:

- Make release-bot available as GitHub app

- Listen to GitHub callbacks instead of polling GitHub API in endless
  loop

- Improve end to end integration test suite

- Make release-bot \'smarter\' in various ways (e.g communication with
  maintainer)

- We are open to your new ideas

Repo : <https://github.com/user-cont/release-bot>

#### How to start {#_how_to_start}

If you are interested to start working on this project, please see our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/user-cont/release-bot/issues). Choose
an issue to work on and open PR. Issues that are newcomers friendly are
labeled with &#96;good first issue label&#96;. Good code contributions
during application period highly increasing your chance to be selected.

# Google Summer of Code Application Process {#_google_summer_of_code_application_process_6}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Fedora is proud to have been accepted as a GSoC mentoring organization.
Student applications open on March 25, 2019.
::::

Interested in applying for Google Summer of Code with Fedora? Here is
how you do that!

The following are specific guidelines for students to use to submit an
application for the GSoC program through the Fedora Project. Please go
through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete
by the deadline. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Important {#_important_6}

&#42; Timelines are set by Google for the entire program. Follow the
timeline. &#42; Applications are due in Google's system by April 9th,
2019 18:00 (CEST). &#42; Applications Must be filed in the Google
system. No other material can be read or accepted. &#42; The final
application is required to be submitted as a PDF.

## Student Application Process {#_student_application_process_6}

### Learn {#_learn_6}

Before you do anything, learn about the program and Fedora. These links
may be helpful:

&#42; [GSoC official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) &#42;
[Information about Fedora's Participation in GSoC](index.html)

### Communicate {#_communicate_6}

Begin
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
with the community. Our community members can help you understand the
existing project proposals. If you're going to try and propose your own
project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and
find a mentor.

&#42; [the summer-coding
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org)
&#42; [the development
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org).

Don't forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn
more. If you're going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the
time of proposal.

### Apply {#_apply_6}

:::: note
::: title
:::

Fedora is proud to have been accepted as a GSoC mentoring organization.
Student applications open on March 25, 2019.
::::

The application process consists of 5 steps:

1.  Create a FAS account [FAS Account Signup / Login
    Page](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts)

2.  Join the fedora-summer-coding mailing list [Fedora Summer Coding
    Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    This list is fairly low volume.

3.  Join the devel mailing list [Devel Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
    appropriately.

4.  Sign the FPCA by following the directions
    [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System/CompleteFPCA)

5.  Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the
    next section at the [Google Summer of Code
    Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/). We strongly
    encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback
    about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback.
The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and
provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you must find a mentor.
Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key
to doing this. If you don't want to share your proposal publicly
consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the
mentor/reviewers. You can also share the link via a private ticket in
our [Pagure Repository](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues).
While we would normally not suggest a close-sourced tool such as Google
Docs, in this case it is potentially easier for you because you a) must
have a Google account to be able to apply to the program; and b) must
generate a PDF for your application.

#### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements {#_google_summer_of_code_application_and_supplemental_material_requirements_6}

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

&#42; What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a
project for proposal from [ideas list](gsoc/2019/ideas.xml). While it is
possible to propose your own project, it is often more successful for
you to select one that is already proposed by a mentor.

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email.

&#42; About You - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any
past involvement with the Fedora Project or another open-source project
as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and
non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls,
etc.) &#42;&#42; What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates
you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you
organize your work.

&#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you want to
work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with?

&#42; Why This Project? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which
specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project,
do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits
the community. &#42;&#42; Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for
the project? &#42;&#42; What relevant experience do you have for this
project? &#42;&#42; What do you want to gain from this project?
&#42;&#42; Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

&#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?

&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

&#42; What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are
periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

:::: note
::: title
:::

You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with
your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the
information from the supplemental application requirements section
below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if
any.

We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF.
Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however
all information must be readable.
::::

### Keep communicating {#_keep_communicating_6}

We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and
listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your
proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other
contributors are often very busy people.

&#42;&#42; 2018

# Google Summer of Code 2018

![gsoc logo](gsoc_logo.png)

This page contains information about Fedora's participation in Google
Summer of Code (GSoC). Please feel free to contact us via the mailing
list below for clarifications and more information. You can also use the
IRC channel.

## What can I do today? {#what-can-i-do-today}

Today you should read through the [ideas](ideas.xml) and think about our
[application process.](application.xml)

## Student Information {#student-information}

Do you want to contribute to one of the world's leading innovative Linux
distributions? GSoC could be your chance. Please refer to the
information below.

&#42; If you're interested in working on an existing project, read up on
the project and the related technology. There is no need to contact the
mentor unless you have a specific question about the project. Don't send
an \'I'm interested\' email.

&#42; If you're interested in proposing your own project start looking
around the Fedora Project for a mentor and send your idea to the mailing
list or post it on the wiki.

&#42; You may also wish to start working on the Fedora specific parts of
the application, see below for more information. Carefully review the
student responsibilities section.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
you to get started.

&#42; [Fedora Project
Overview](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/project/fedora-overview.html)
&#42; [Fedora Technical and Community
Documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org) &#42; [How to use
IRC](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC) &#42; [Information
about Development in Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Development)

### Student Responsibilities {#student-responsibilities}

You are the key ingredient for your project's success. This project is
important to you, your mentor, and the entire Fedora Community.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Communicating early and often with your mentor. &#42; Blogging
every week about what you're learning, how you're doing, challenges and
successes. This is key way to keep the entire Fedora Community informed.
&#42; Working with your mentor on realistic achievable milestones that
provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Attending the brief
student calls, as announced &#42; Being accountable for your success and
your actions

### Student Application {#student-application}

Please read and follow the [student application
process](application.xml).

## Mentor Information {#mentor-information}

Want to help the next generation of contributors grow? Want to bring new
contributors to Fedora? Want to advance your projects along their
roadmap? GSoC can be a chance to do all of this.

:::: note

If you are contacted directly by a student, we encourage you to reply
and include the mailing list and/or IRC channel to keep the process
transparent and to ensure the inquiry is able to be answered by more
people than just you.

### How to Propose a Project {#_how_to_propose_a_project_6}

If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several
things:

1.  Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project. You will be helping someone else when they get
    stuck. You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

2.  It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how
    an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
    and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
    finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
    Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the
    project. In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the
    student do some of the \'driving.\'

3.  Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case
    are more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support
    from you.

4.  Who can help you? Try to find a second mentor for the project.

If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you
should post your idea to the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues). Your issue should
be tagged &#42;GSoC&#42; and use the &#42;Google Summer of Code&#42;
template. We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with
mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal

### Can I be a Mentor Without a Project? {#_can_i_be_a_mentor_without_a_project_6}

Yes! You can either:

&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
requires a different level of communication throughout the project, but
can be the most rewarding.

&#42; Be a general mentor. This is a person who works with all students
regardless of their project. To become a general mentor please open an
issue in the [Mentored Projects Issue
Tracker](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues) offering your help.
Please tag the issue with the &#42;GSoC&#42; tag.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; Read about good mentoring in the [Manual on
Mentoring](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsoc-mentoring/what-makes-a-good-mentor)

#### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled. &#42; Be the final,
accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not.
This is responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

#### Summary {#_summary}

Add Fedora user account authentication and
[fedmsg](http://www.fedmsg.com/en/stable/) integration to Happiness
Packets to deploy in Fedora's infrastructure

#### Background {#_background}

[Happiness Packets](https://www.happinesspackets.io/) is a web
application to send positive feedback and thank-you notes to open source
contributors. You can send a note with your name or anonymously. The
Fedora community plans to have a Fedora Appreciation Week in 2018, where
contributors thank each other and celebrate our accomplishments
together. Fedora wants to extend Happiness Packets by giving a [Fedora
Badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/about) to anyone who sends a
Happiness Packet to another contributor. To do this, we need to fork
Happiness Packets and add support for Fedora's authentication system and
add a [fedmsg hook](http://www.fedmsg.com/en/stable/publishing/). This
lets Fedora contributors log in and receive a badge when they send a
Happiness Packet.

#### Details {#_details}

### Atomic IoT (likely useful in numerous other Atomic ideas) host upgrade daemon {#_atomic_iot_likely_useful_in_numerous_other_atomic_ideas_host_upgrade_daemon}

- Skill level: medium

- Skills required: python3 ans/or C

- Mentor(s): Peter Robinson

IoT devices need to be almost impossible to brick. When you upgrade a
device if it doesn't work it needs to be able to automatically role
back, or at the very least be able to contact the update service for a
newer fixed version.

A daemon to manage this state is required. The daemon would need to be
able to do the following:

&#42; Monitor the status of available downloads &#42; Apply the Atomic
update delta &#42; Set a \'boot once\' flag to boot the new version via
grub &#42; Set a hardware watchdog &#42; initiate a reboot of the system
&#42; If boot to normal userspace fails the watchdog triggers and it
resets to the old version &#42; If boot succeeds to the point the daemon
starts up it then proceeds to phase two of the upgrade process &#42;
Unsets watchdog so the OS won't reset &#42; Checks it can see all
required network interfaces &#42; Checks it can resolve addresses and
contact the update server &#42; Check it's connected to all other
critical services (eg MQTT or a HTTPS API &#42; Checks it can see and
all sensors and services are running correctly

There needs to be a means of specifying what components are critical to
the successful operation of the device. Some components will be the same
across all types of device such as the ability to check network
interfaces are operating, to check an update service is available, to
check services are available etc but some might be plugins eg to check
GPIO is working, specific IIO sensors, cameras or other such things are
seen as expected.

- What are we looking for: An initial daemon with basic functionality
  with good design that can be extended. Integration with atomic updates
  etc.

### Fedora Dockerfile linter leveraging Container Best Practices {#_fedora_dockerfile_linter_leveraging_container_best_practices}

- Skill level: Intermediate

- Skills required: Python, containers

- Mentor(s): Tomas Tomecek, Eliska Slobodova

- Contacts (IRC &amp; email): ttomecek (ttomecek \@redhat.com), eslobodo
  (eslobodo \@redhat.com)

#### Description {#_description_21}

Fedora infrastructure for container image delivery is lacking any kind
of automated testing of the images or underlying Dockerfiles. [The
Container Best Practices
document](https://github.com/projectatomic/container-best-practices) is
a digest of recommended practices for writing and deploying images.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_18}

With Container Best Practices serving as a "cheatsheet", you will create
a tool to perform basic and advanced checks on Dockerfiles and images
that can be applicable generally regardless of an image. In cooperation
with the Fedora infrastructure team, you will deploy the tool in the
container infrastructure so that the tests can be executed automatically
upon a new build/commit or locally before the developer pushes the
changes remotely.

### Advanced test cases for images running in OpenShift using conu {#_advanced_test_cases_for_images_running_in_openshift_using_conu}

- Skill level: Intermediate

- Skills required: Python, containers, OpenShift

- Mentor(s): Tomas Tomecek, Dominika Hodovska

- Contacts (IRC &amp; email): ttomecek (ttomecek \@redhat.com), dhodovsk
  (dhodovsk \@redhat.com)

#### Description {#_description_22}

[Conu](https://github.com/fedora-modularity/conu) is a library which
provides Python API to interact with a selected container runtime. It
simplifies writing of tests for container images. However, the project
currently lacks support for OpenShift and Kubernetes.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_19}

- Your primary goal will be to deliver at least 10 new functions that
  will enable the users to write tests for OpenShift scenarios.

- Your secondary goal will be to write test for at least 5 images (eg
  mariadb, mysql, postgresql, golang, rust) using conu's full
  capabilities.

### Complete support for OpenShift and Kubernetes as a backend in conu {#_complete_support_for_openshift_and_kubernetes_as_a_backend_in_conu}

- Skill level: Intermediate - Expert

- Skills required: python, containers

- Mentor(s): Tomas Tomecek

- Contacts (IRC &amp; email): ttomecek (ttomecek \@redhat.com)

#### Description {#_description_23}

[conu](https://github.com/fedora-modularity/conu/) defines a generic API
to interact with containers and container engines. To make the project
more usable, we would like to add implementation of well known container
orchestration systems --- Kubernetes and OpenShift.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_20}

- Write a series of pull requests to add support for Kubernetes and
  OpenShift in conu project.

- The newly added functionality needs to have integration tests which
  can run inside CI environment and are passing.

- And finally, the feature should be demonstrated it works well by at
  least 3 real examples.

### Continuous Integration for Fedora Media Writer + Tests {#_continuous_integration_for_fedora_media_writer_tests}

- Skill level: Intermediate

- Skills required: CI, C++, Qt

- Mentor(s): Martin Bříza

- Contacts (IRC &amp; email): mbriza@freenode &amp; <m@rtinbriza.cz>

#### Description {#_description_24}

[Fedora Media Writer](https://github.com/MartinBriza/MediaWriter) is a
tool with two build platforms and three deployment platforms. It's quite
challenging to check all the new added code for being able to build
properly and as of now, there are no tests.

Your task in this project would be to get a CI platform of your choice
to work well with FMW on GitHub. The required environments are Fedora
and macOS. Windows builds are done using the MinGW packages in Fedora
and FMW can run using Wine - this should be sufficient for testing,
however testing the MinGW builds under native Windows is a definite
plus.

Qt provides the QTest framework for testing the application - it's the
preferred platform to write tests in this case, however using a bash or
Python library is likely okay, too. However, once again, as QTest is
easily attachable to the internal structures of FMW, it's strongly
suggested.

Bonus points are if you get automatic binary builds published in the
Releases section for tags.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_21}

Working CI integration for macOS and Fedora-latest or Rawhide. A set of
tests covering at least 5 closed bugs.

### ARM uBoot Support in Fedora Media Writer {#_arm_uboot_support_in_fedora_media_writer}

- Skill level: Intermediate - Expert

- Skills required: C++, Qt, ext4, bash/Python (?)

- Mentor(s): Martin Bříza

- Contacts (IRC &amp; email): mbriza@freenode &amp; <m@rtinbriza.cz>

#### Description {#_description_25}

[Fedora Media Writer](https://github.com/MartinBriza/MediaWriter) now
supports writing ARM images to portable media. These cards can then boot
on devices that support Fedora out of the box, like the Raspberry Pi.
However, to support most other boards, one has to do some modifications
to the image on the flash drive. The first of them is writing uBoot
(open source bootloader) to the start of the drive. Then it's sometimes
necessary to tweak some environment variables or modify a configuration
file.

These are the tasks that are possible to be automated. However, it's
necessary to find a way how to do that in a clean fashion. As an example
of an approach to this problem, you can take a look at the
[arm-image-installer](https://pagure.io/arm-image-installer/). One
option would be to cooperate with the ARM SIG to create a solution that
uses their know-how or code directly. I have some ideas so please go
ahead and talk to me.

Remember, this is pretty trivial to do on Linux, however we need this
functionality to work on Windows and macOS. This induces issues -
especially with filesystem handling. For your project proposal, I expect
you include a rough description of how you're planning to tackle this
problem.

#### Deliverables {#_deliverables_22}

A Fedora Media Writer build that's able to deliver a Fedora SD card that
can boot on a currently unsupported ARM platform (for example,
Cubieboard) on Linux, Windows and macOS.

### Open Ideas From Previous Years {#_open_ideas_from_previous_years}

In addition to the above list of ideas, you may want to check out ideas
from previous years and contact the mentors for those projects to see if
they're still interested in mentoring someone this year.

*Note*: Do not submit a proposal for an idea from a previous year
without contacting the mentor to ensure they will be available to mentor
you. &#42;Without a mentor, proposals will be rejected.&#42;

# Google Summer of Code Application Process {#_google_summer_of_code_application_process_7}

Interested in applying for Google Summer of Code with Fedora? Here is
how you do that!

The following are specific guidelines for students to use to submit an
application for the GSoC program through the Fedora Project. Please go
through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete
by the deadline. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Important {#_important_7}

&#42; Timelines are set by Google for the entire program. Follow the
timeline. &#42; Applications are due in Google's system by March 27,
2018 18:00 (CEST). &#42; Applications Must be filed in the Google
system. No other material can be read or accepted. &#42; The final
application is required to be submitted as a PDF.

## Student Application Process {#_student_application_process_7}

### Learn {#_learn_7}

Before you do anything, learn about the program and Fedora. These links
may be helpful:

&#42; [GSoC official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) &#42;
[Information about Fedora's Participation in GSoC](index.html)

### Communicate {#_communicate_7}

Begin
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
with the community. Our community members can help you understand the
existing project proposals. If you're going to try and propose your own
project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and
find a mentor.

&#42; [the summer-coding
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org)
&#42; [the development
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org).

Don't forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn
more. If you're going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the
time of proposal.

### Apply {#_apply_7}

The application process consists of 5 steps:

1.  Create a FAS account [FAS Account Signup / Login
    Page](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts)

2.  Join the fedora-summer-coding mailing list [Fedora Summer Coding
    Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    This list is fairly low volume.

3.  Join the devel mailing list [Devel Mailing
    List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
    this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
    appropriately.

4.  Sign the FPCA by following the directions
    [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System/CompleteFPCA)

5.  Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the
    next section at the [Google Summer of Code
    Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/). We strongly
    encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback
    about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback.
The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and
provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you must find a mentor.
Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key
to doing this. If you don't want to share your proposal publicly
consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the
mentor/reviewers. You can also share the link via a private ticket in
our [Pagure Repository](https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues).
While we would normally not suggest a close-sourced tool such as Google
Docs, in this case it is potentially easier for you because you a) must
have a Google account to be able to apply to the program; and b) must
generate a PDF for your application.

#### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements {#_google_summer_of_code_application_and_supplemental_material_requirements_7}

In addition to the information Google requests, the Fedora Project
requires you to submit the following information:

&#42; What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a
project for proposal from [ideas list](ideas.xml). While it is possible
to propose your own project, it is often more successful for you to
select one that is already proposed by a mentor.

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email.

&#42; About You - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any
past involvement with the Fedora Project or another open-source project
as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and
non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls,
etc.) &#42;&#42; What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates
you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you
organize your work.

&#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you want to
work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with?

&#42; Why This Project? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which
specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project,
do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits
the community. &#42;&#42; Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for
the project? &#42;&#42; What relevant experience do you have for this
project? &#42;&#42; What do you want to gain from this project?
&#42;&#42; Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to
you? What do you think the final deliverable is?

&#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?

&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period.

&#42; What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in
university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are
periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

:::: note
::: title
:::

You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with
your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the
information from the supplemental application requirements section
below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if
any.

We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF.
Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however
all information must be readable.
::::

### Keep communicating {#_keep_communicating_7}

We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and
listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your
proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other
contributors are often very busy people.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professionals. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning. &#42; Learn tools and processes
that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology
after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many of our contributors are long-time contributors. They remain because
they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise,
advice and mentoring to you! People who stay around the community and do
good work are noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being
hired by Red Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red
Hat, as well as interns in various positions. This is just an example,
as experience and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is
influential in your career in many ways.

As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested, curious, and willing to become comfortable being
productively lost. This is the state of learning. You learn by finding
your way around and figuring things out with the support of your mentor
and the community.

### Student Responsibilities {#student-responsibilities}

You are the key ingredient for your project's success. This project is
important to you, your mentor, and the entire Fedora Community.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Communicating early and often with your mentor. &#42; Blogging
every week about what you're learning, how you're doing, challenges and
successes. This is key way to keep the entire Fedora Community informed.
&#42; Working with your mentor on realistic achievable milestones that
provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Attending a brief
monthly student call &#42; Being accountable for your success and your
actions

### Student Application {#student-application}

Please read and follow the [student application
process](application_process.xml).

## Mentors

Want to help the next generation of contributors grow? Want to bring new
contributors to Fedora? Want to advance your projects along their
roadmap? GSoC can be a chance to do all of this.

The contributors of the Fedora Project can propose ideas and mentor
them. Please feel free to check following links and please add your
ideas to the main idea page. Furthermore, if you are not interested in
proposing an idea but still want to support the program, please check
the students\' idea page and pick one as per your interest. Lastly,
consider becoming a Supporting Mentor and helping students across
projects.

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly. Other ideas
may be more general and require more planning during onboarding.

&#42; It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.
Also, students learn more when they help design and guide the project.
In other words, provide guidance and direction but let the student do
some of the \'driving.\'

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support from you.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones
that provide for regular deliverables and feedback. &#42; Regular
communication with your student. This means you must be regularly
available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you need to know
early and help your student be ready for your brief absence. &#42;
Attend a brief monthly mentors call. &#42; Be the final, accountable
person for deciding if the student is successful or not. This is
responsibility akin to being a professor or boss.

| des           | server, used in businesses globally to authenticate  |
| cription&#42; | and identify people. We have a large code base that  |
|               | has gone through nearly 20 years of evolution.       |

|               | Part of this evolution has been the recent addition  |
|               | of a python administration framework designed to     |
|               | replace our legacy perl tools. The framework already |
|               | has the base classes designed and written, but we    |
|               | need help to knit together the high level            |

|               | be ranked based on their importance, where critical  |
|               | flaws shall be ranked first and potential false      |
|               | positives are ranked last. We will develop a tool to |
|               | perform continuous static analysis with different    |
|               | static analyzers and propose a warning               |
|               | classification method using their outputs. We will   |

| &#42;Idea     | Plinth is developed by                               |
| des           | [Freedombox](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/)    |
| cription&#42; | which is a Debian based project. The Freedombox is   |
|               | aiming for building a 100% free software             |
|               | self-hosting web server to deploy social             |
|               | applications on small machines. It provides online   |
|               | communication tools respecting user privacy and data |
|               | ownership, replacing services provided by            |
|               | third-parties that under surveillance.               |
|               | [Plinth](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Plinth)  |
|               | is the front-end of Freedombox, written in Python.   |
|               |                                                      |
|               | This idea mainly about migrate Plinth from Deb-based |
|               | to RPM-based, and make it available for Fedora       |
|               | Server which will running on ARM machines. It would  |
|               | be better of student to be familiar with ARM based   |
|               | hardware and knowing something about how to running  |
|               | a Fedora Server on it, or use something like Qemu if |
|               | you don't know hardware.                             |
|               |                                                      |
|               | The main goal of this idea is to make Plinth works   |
|               | fine in Fedora Server or Minimal flavor, due to      |
|               | Plinth write APT commands hard coded, so it is       |
|               | better yo make it more adoptive for RPM. The         |
|               | secondary goal is to make a RPM package for Plinth   |
|               | from source and setup a repo for it, so that         |
|               | everyone who use Fedora could use Plinth.            |

| &#42;Idea     | Fedora Media Writer is a tool that makes putting     |
| des           | Fedora images on portable media (such as flash       |
| cription&#42; | drives) much easier. Since Fedora 25, it is offered  |
|               | as the default download options for users coming to  |
|               | [Get Fedora](https://getfedora.org) from a Mac or a  |
|               | Windows computer.                                    |
|               |                                                      |
|               | Ever since the rewrite from liveusb-creator, there   |
|               | has been some features missing from it and due to    |
|               | the popular demand, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get |
|               | them readded. You won't need to implement all of     |
|               | these. Just one would be perfectly fine. However,    |
|               | please contact me first so we can arrange the        |
|               | details of your potential application.               |
|               |                                                      |
|               | There is a short list of some things that could be   |
|               | done (however, feel free to get in touch about       |
|               | anything else, or look on the GitHub page for some   |
|               | more):                                               |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; *Persistent storage*. To explain how it works, |
|               | I'll start with how live media works now for us:     |
|               | After booting into the live system, you can do       |
|               | whatever you want, install programs, save files to   |
|               | your home folder or even modify the root filesystem, |
|               | as much as your free memory permits you. However,    |
|               | after rebooting you lose all those changes because   |
|               | the partitions on the drive are not touched.         |
|               | Persistent storage adds the possibility to retain    |
|               | those changes through reboots so you would be able   |
|               | to install new apps to your live environment or work |
|               | with files stored on the flash drive.                |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; Being able to write the images without         |
|               | destroying the data that was already present on the  |
|               | flash drive before.                                  |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; Having a Fedora ARM image resized to fit the   |
|               | size of your SD card immediately after having it     |
|               | written.                                             |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; Proper privilege escalation through launchd    |
|               | for the helper process on macOS.                     |
|               |                                                      |
|               | Understanding of libraries and techniques relevant   |
|               | to this project on Linux, Mac or Windows (or all of  |
|               | them) is a big plus.                                 |

|               | and be involved in the project that is the first     |

| &#42;Idea     | Fedora Workstation ships custom Qt themes that match |
| des           | its Adwaita and Highcontrast themes from its default |
| cription&#42; | GNOME desktop environment. This makes Qt             |
|               | applications blend nicely into the overall Fedora    |
|               | Worstation experience.                               |
|               |                                                      |
|               | However, to fully support most of the Qt             |
|               | applications, we need to have QtQuickControls (QML)  |
|               | themes implemented, too.                             |
|               |                                                      |
|               | Work on this would consist of three main parts:      |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; Figuring out where and how to install the      |
|               | theme (CMake) &#42; Implementing the look of all     |
|               | necessary widgets (QML) &#42; Making this theme      |
|               | selected by default when the app runs in GNOME       |
|               | (probably C++, in the QGnomePlatform project)        |
|               |                                                      |
|               | This project is best suited to a candidate who wants |

| &#42;Idea     | Right now, metrics collection in CommOps is not very |
| des           | efficient and requires a lot of manual work. Metrics |
| cription&#42; | for various events/FAS groups/users are collected    |
|               | using scripts which query datagrepper and return     |
|               | results. This process is very time consuming and     |
|               | writing scripts each time is a very tedious process. |
|               | Also, querying the datagrepper to get data everytime |
|               | is redundant and time-consuming.                     |
|               |                                                      |

|               | generation system for Fedora with handy features to  |
|               | pull statistics. Take a look at the [Pagure          |

### Open Ideas From GSoC 2016

In addition to the above list of ideas, you may want to check out ideas
from previous years and contact the mentors for those projects to see if
they're still interested in mentoring someone this year.

*Note*: Do not submit a proposal for an idea from a previous year
without contacting the mentor to ensure they will be available to mentor
you. &#42;Without a mentor, proposals will be rejected.&#42;

&#8230;. March 20: 16:00 UTC Student application period opens April 03:
16:00 UTC Student application Deadline

&#42;&#42;Note&#42;&#42; There is a new requirement that you submit all
materials in PDF form. See below. &#8230;.

This timeline is decided and published by Google, see the full timeline
on [the official
page](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

The following are specific guidelines for students to use to submit an
application for the GSoC program through the Fedora Project. Please go
through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete
by the deadline listed above. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Student Application Process {#student-application-process}

### Learn {#learn}

Before you do anything, learn about the program and Fedora. These links
may be helpful:

&#42; [GSoC official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) &#42;
[GSoC 2016 FAQs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
&#42; [The Four Foundations of
Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/project/fedora-overview.html)
&#42; [General GSoC Guidance](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_2017)
&#42; [Mailing List
Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mailing_list_guidelines)

### Communicate {#communicate}

Begin
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
with the community. Our community members can help you understand the
existing project proposals. If you're going to try and propose your own
project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and
find a mentor.

&#42; [the summer-coding
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org)
&#42; [the development
list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org).

Don't forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn
more. If you're going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the
time of proposal.

### Apply {#apply}

The application for students is split into three main parts. All parts
need to be completed by the due date.

\\1. Google Summer of Code Application

\\2. Supplemental Application Materials on the Fedora Project Wiki

\\3. Additional Fedora Requirements

#### Google Summer of Code Application

Submit the application/proposal at the [Google Summer of Code
Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/)

&#42;Note:&#42; You must submit a PDF version of all of the information
you prepare with your application using the Google site. The PDF should
consist of the information from the supplemental application
requirements section below. It should also contain any custom project
you are proposing, if any.

We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF.
Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however
all information must be readable. It is acceptable for you to submit PDF
printouts from the wiki.

#### Supplemental Application Materials on the Fedora Project Wiki

Chose a project for proposal from
[Summer_coding_ideas_for_2017](ideas.xml). While it is possible to
propose your own project, it is often more successful for you to select
one that is already proposed by a mentor.

Create a new wiki page to hold your application. The url should look
like

[&#96;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_2017/Student_Application_Yourusername&#96;](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_2017/Student_Application_Yourusername),
replacing &#96;Yourusername&#96; with your actual [Fedora Account
System](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System) username.

You should include the information that is relevant to the project your
are selecting or proposing as well as information about you, your
background, etc. The following format provides some guidance:

&#42; Contact Information &#42;&#42; List your Name, Email Address, Blog
URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend
to email so be sure you're reading your email. &#42; About You -
Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Do you have any past involvement
with the Fedora Project or another open-source project as a contributor?
What kind of contributions have you made (code and non-code)? Please
share any public contributions you have made (urls, etc.) &#42;&#42;
What are you studying? Why? &#42;&#42; What motivates you to do your
best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you organize your
work. &#42; Why Us? - Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Why do you
want to work with the Fedora Project? &#42;&#42; Do you plan to continue
contributing to the Fedora Project after GSoC? If yes, what
sub-project(s) are you interested with? &#42; Why This Project? -
Consider these questions &#42;&#42; Which specific project interests
you? If you are proposing your own project, do it here. If you are
proposing the project, explain why it benefits the community. &#42;&#42;
Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for the project? &#42;&#42; What
relevant experience do you have for this project? &#42;&#42; What do you
want to gain from this project? &#42;&#42; Describe this project in your
own words. What does it mean to you? What do you think the final
deliverable is? &#42; Why should we choose you over other applicants?
&#42; Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have
regular deliverables throughout the entire period. &#42; What are you
specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in university,
internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are periods of
time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at
accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

#### Additional Fedora Requirements

Students need to do the following as part of the application process:

&#42; Create a FAS account [FAS Account Signup / Login
Page](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts) &#42; If you can't edit
the wiki (see next step), email [Brian (bex)
Exelbierd](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex), the primary
administrator with your FAS ID and request access. &#42; On the project
wiki link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki, create a user page. Do this by
opening a new web browser tab and going to
[&#96;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Yourusername&#96;](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Yourusername),
replacing &#96;Yourusername&#96; with your actual Fedora Account System
username. &#42;&#42; This [user page
template](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:Userpage) provides a
basic layout that you can copy. You can also look at the markup for
other users\' pages. Here's a selection of some nice user pages:
&#42;&#42;&#42; [Joerg
Simon](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jsimon) &#42;&#42;&#42;
[Iliana
Weller](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ilianaw?rd=User:Ianweller)
&#42;&#42;&#42; [Paul W.
Frields](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pfrields) &#42;&#42;&#42;
[Caius C. Chance](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Kaio2012?rd=User:Kaio)
&#42;&#42; Do not forget to add the Summer coding category to your page,
for example for 2017: &#96;[]{#category:Summer_coding_2017}&#96;
&#42;&#42; When you save the page, remember to click \'watch this page\'
at the top. &#42; Join the fedora-summer-coding mailing list [Fedora
Summer Coding Mailing
List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
This list is fairly low volume. &#42; Join the devel mailing list [Devel
Mailing
List](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org) -
this list can be higher volume you may wish to use mail filters
appropriately. &#42; Sign the FPCA by following the directions
[here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Account_System/CompleteFPCA)

### Let others know

Let others know about your submission by forwarding your application URL
with a brief description about your proposal to the
[summer-coding](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
mailing list.

### Keep communicating {#keep-communicating}

We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and
listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your
proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other
contributors are often very busy people.

### Need Help?

If you need help, use the methods described at [GSOC_2017](index.html)

![GSoC_logo](GSoC_2016.png)

The Fedora Project has represented the Google Summer of Code program for
ten years and we are participating in the 2016 program as well. This
wiki page serves as the GSoC portal. Please feel free to contact us via
[sumer-coding](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org/)
list for clarifications and more information. You can also use the IRC

## Students {#students}

Students who are looking for challenges and would like to contribute to
the world's most leading and innovative Linux distribution, this could
be the chance. Please feel free to contact and refer to the material and
start contacting mentors.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Create lifetime connections.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various positions. This is just an example, as experience
and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is influential on your
career in many ways. As long-standing communities with many facets, it
is possible for you to find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being productively lost. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

### Step-by-step guide for students

Please check the [step-by-step guide for
students](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_Guide_students).

### Student's application

Please refer to the following to follow the students\' application
process,

1.  [Student Application Process](student_application_process.xml)

## Administration {#administration}

## Mentors {#mentors}

The contributors of the Fedora Project can propose ideas and mentor
them. Please feel free to check following links and please add your
ideas to the main idea page. Furthermore, if you are not interested in
proposing an idea but still want to support the program, please check
the students\' idea page and pick one as per your interest.

2.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

&#42; It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the
student is successful or not, which affects payment.

## Idea list for GSoC 2016

### Implement Tinykdump

*Status*: Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea*: Tinykdump is a minimal daemon to capture kernel-based
crash dumping (kdump) memory image to usb storage. Compared to the
traditional kdump solution, it is,

&#96;&#42; more reliable and scalable&#96;\
&#96;&#42; has smaller memory foot-print&#96;\
&#96;&#42; more friendly to kernel developers &#96;

More information here: <https://fedorahosted.org/tinykdump/>

*Knowledge prerequisite*: Python, kernel programming (desired)

*Skill level*: intermediate (programming)

*Contacts*: [CAI Qian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:caiqian)

*Mentor(s)*: [CAI Qian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:caiqian)

*Notes*: Rough roadmap:

&#42; Implement tinykdump daemon to be included in Fedora. &#42; Submit
kernel patches for reserving kdump memory at run-time for community
review and inclusion. &#42; Currently, pstore only log kernel messages
for panic and Oops. Patches are needed to support logging of kdump
kernel and initramfs console output.

### Implement MIPS bits to packages

*Status*: Proposed

*Summary of idea*: Some packages are missing implementation bits for
MIPS architecture. The goal of this project is implementing and posting
them upstream.

*URL*: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/MIPS>

*Knowledge prerequisite*: Packaging, Python, C

*Skill level*: intermediate

*Contacts*: [Michal Toman](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mtoman)

*Mentor(s)*: [Michal Toman](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mtoman)

*Notes*: The following packages are in question:

&#42; &#42;java&#42; - builds on 32-bit MIPS but does not work, dies
with SIGILL &#42; &#42;redhat-lsb&#42; - misses assembly bits for MIPS
&#42; &#42;anaconda/blivet&#42; - completely MIPS unaware &#42;
&#42;valgrind&#42; - no FPXX support on 32-bit MIPS, builds on mips64el
but does not work &#42; &#42;elfutils&#42; - unwinding is not supported
on MIPS &#42; &#42;u-boot&#42; - build working MIPS images &#42; &#8230;
there are more but these are the most painful

This is obviously too much for a single project, we are going to agree
on a reasonable subset.

*Expected outcome*:

&#42; Better MIPS support in upstream projects and Fedora packages &#42;
Learn about MIPS architecture &#42; Learn to communicate with upstreams

|               | increasingly instrumenting and integrating automated |
|               | systems to stand up and maintain their               |
|               | infrastructure. This same approach can be taken to   |
|               | support community infrastructure in a distributed    |
|               | and automated fashion, that doesn't force people to  |
|               | choose between using their precious volunteer time   |
|               | to \'build things\' or \'build communities that      |
|               | build things.\' The community operations team works  |
|               | across numerous technologies, and interest areas in  |
|               | Fedora, including Messaging, Storytelling, Fedora    |
|               | Badges, Fedora Hubs, Wiki, Culture, Metrics, Voting, |
|               | and other miscellaneous topics. It is important to   |
|               | note that CommOps team members are generalists, and  |
|               | the strengths and interests of individual applicants |
|               | will determine the precise nature of your work.      |
|               | Enthusiasm for FOSS culture and community            |
|               | organization, and effective communication skills are |
|               | most important. Specific deliverables can include    |
|               | automated metrics gathering, real-time messaging     |
|               | integration with Fedora hubs, and other big-data     |
|               | analysis and visualization. Tools are primarily      |
|               | written in python, and utilize libraries such as     |
|               | fedmsg, numpy, pandas, pygals, flask, sqlalchemy. We |
|               | also leverage other web technologies like HTML5 and  |
|               | Javascript, and frameworks such as bootstrap and     |
|               | handlebars to deliver these metrics.                 |
|               |                                                      |

| Notes         | Fedora has been in the process of creating a new web |
|               | presence for all of the Fedora users, subprojects,   |
|               | and communities. We also plan to integrate some of   |
|               | the features of this system with the                 |
|               | [prototype](https://developer-phracek.rhcloud.com)   |
|               | of the Fedora Developer Portal, which is targeted at |
|               | helping general developers use Fedora. While the     |
|               | Hubs project itself is aimed at Fedora contributor   |
|               | circles, the reusable features will allow the Portal |
|               | to use this work to speak to general developers who  |
|               | may not have an interest in working in the Fedora    |
|               | community, but want to connect with community        |
|               | members for advice, best practices, or to generate   |
|               | interest in *their* upstream project.                |
|               |                                                      |
|               | Several of the principal app developers in the       |
|               | Fedora Engineering team will be working together     |
|               | with you on this project during the GSoC term.       |
|               | You'll participate directly with team members daily  |
|               | on core features of Hubs as well as integration with |
|               | the Portal. This is a great opportunity both for     |
|               | regular mentorship and for being deeply involved in  |
|               | an exciting and fast-moving project with the Fedora  |

| Notes         | Pagure is a forge written in python and offering the |

|               | forge such as GitHub or GitLab it is also pretty     |
|               | different for example it does not namespace projects |

| Notes         | &#42; FreeIPA is a domain and directory server. This |
|               | task implements a UI for setting it up.              |
|               |                                                      |
|               | &#42; The Rolekit Project provides a platform API    |
|               | for deploying Server Roles such as FreeIPA onto a    |
|               | system. Currently, it supports creating a Domain     |
|               | Controller (based on FreeIPA) or a Database Server   |
|               | (based on PostgreSQL). A major component of the      |
|               | Fedora Server is the Cockpit Project, a web-based    |
|               | management console for servers. The goal of this     |
|               | effort would be to enhance the Cockpit UI so that an |
|               | administrator could deploy the FreeIPA role.         |

| Notes         | The Fedora community produces a variety of content   |
|               | suitable for user reference. Members of the Fedora   |
|               | Project produce documentation in a variety of ways - |

|               | material from the infra team; application design,    |
|               | interface design, microservices, buildfarms and      |
|               | more. All at work meeting the needs of a transparent |
|               | organization built on open source technologies and   |
|               | open development practices.                          |

|               | Anerist is intended to consume reference materials,  |
|               | in whatever format they are discovered in, and       |
|               | render them to produce a neatly indexed html site    |
|               | with a common style and theme. To alleviate manual   |
|               | effort in this conversion process, and in the        |
|               | process of \'cycling\' translations, the application |
|               | is event driven, with content regenerated on each    |
|               | change of the sources using CICD technologies. This  |
|               | design relies on modularized conversion tools, which |
|               | also allows for programmatically generated content   |
|               | and drop-in custom views of technologies or          |

## Open Ideas From GSoC 2015

In addition to the above list of ideas, you may want to check out ideas
from previous years and contact the mentors for those projects to see if
they're still interested in mentoring someone this year.

*Note*: Do not submit a proposal for an idea from a previous year
without contacting the mentor to ensure they will be available to mentor

\'\'*\'What to write about in your proposal / application.*

&#42; Details on your previous FOSS contributions (if any).

&#42; A detailed plan with your planned activities in May to September
(eg: Exams in university, internships, vacations..etc)

&#42; Bare mind - Remember to contact your mentor before you submit the
application.

*Mentors are more likely to accommodate summer travel if they know in
advance*

We &#42;\_DO NOT\_&#42; accept any document after Google student

unless you have not informed to Org Admins! However if you have any
difficulty to meet this requirement please let us know in advance
(before the deadline).

*\'*FAQ

What is the need of a detailed plan of my activities? It is important to
get an idea about your free time and arrange things at the early stage.
Therefore this is really important and try to make it accurate as much
as possible.

## Students {#students}

Students who are looking for challenges and would like to contribute to
the worlds\' leading and innovative Linux Distro, this could be the
chance. Please feel free to contact and refer to the material and start
contacting mentors.

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real world large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Create life time connections.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various positions. This is just an example, as experience
and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is influential on your
career in many ways.

As long-standing communities with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being productively lost. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

### Step-by-step guide for students {#step-by-step-guide-for-students}

## Mentors {#mentors}

The contributors of the Fedora Project can propose ideas and mentor
them. Please feel free to check following links and please add your
ideas to the main idea page, further if you are not interested in
proposing an idea but still want to support the program please check the
students\' idea page and pick one as per your interest.

2.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

&#42; It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the
student is successful or not, which affects payment.

## Ideas Page {#ideas-page}

&#42;Status :&#42; Open for Ideas\
&#42;Link :&#42; [Summer coding ideas for 2015](ideas.xml)

We encourage students to provide creative yet useful ideas towards the
Fedora project as well. Please use [Student
Idea](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2016/Students_Idea)
page to note your idea. The idea will be moved to the original idea page
once the idea is picked by a mentor.

## Policy on proposal submissions on non-related project ideas

Over the past period we have observed that few students tend to submit
proposals for their own ideas directly to Google-melange. There will be
no communication after then even we ask more info on Google-melange.
Such nature of submissions need extra effort when it comes to manage
proposals on Google-Melange. Therefore as a policy, proposals for
students ideas (with no supporting mentor indicated) that are being
submitted directly to Google-melange will be marked &#42;Ignore&#42;
after a 24 hours of warning unless the students does not voluntary
withdraw the proposal or explain basis of their idea.\
This will not restrict submitting proposals on students ideas, we always
welcome novel and innovative ideas from students if they follow the
right path. As the first step send us your idea and will start discuss
how to manage it. If you have a supporting mentor for your own idea
please feel free to submit it directly to Google-melange and clearly
note the mentors\' contact details.

## Idea list for GSoC 2016 {#idea-list-for-gsoc-2016}

### Implement Tinykdump {#implement-tinykdump}

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:* Tinykdump is a minimal daemon to capture kernel-based
crash dumping (kdump) memory image to usb storage. Compared to the
traditional kdump solution, it is,

&#96;&#42; more reliable and scalable&#96;\
&#96;&#42; has smaller memory foot-print&#96;\
&#96;&#42; more friendly to kernel developers &#96;

More information here: <https://fedorahosted.org/tinykdump/>

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, kernel programming (desired)

*Skill level:* intermediate (programming)

*Contacts:* [CAI Qian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:caiqian)

*Mentor(s):* [CAI Qian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:caiqian)

*Notes:* Rough roadmap:

&#42; Implement tinykdump daemon to be included in Fedora. &#42; Submit
kernel patches for reserving kdump memory at run-time for community
review and inclusion. &#42; Currently, pstore only log kernel messages
for panic and Oops. Patches are needed to support logging of kdump
kernel and initramfs console output.

### Improve Fedora Review

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:* Every package that is included into Fedora needs to
go through a review to ensure it matches the Packaging:Guidelines.
[Fedora Review](https://fedorahosted.org/FedoraReview/) is a tool to
help with the review. It needs constant development to be updated for
changes in the guidelines. Also there is currently no process to ensure
that existing packages adhere to the packaging guidelines. This project
is meant to improve this.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python 2&amp;3 programming skills

*Skill level:* intermediate (programming)

*Contacts:* [Alec Leamas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Leamas),
[Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till)

*Mentor(s):* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till)

*Notes:* Possible tasks:

&#42; Make Fedora Review PEP8 compliant, fix its current test cases
&#42; Help running Fedora Review regularly for existing packages e.g.,
updating the Jenkins continuous builds and/or integrate it into
Taskotron &#42; Add static code checker support to Fedora Review (e.g.
with [csmock](https://git.fedorahosted.org/git/csmock.git)) &#42; Build
a web service mockup supporting the review process
[1](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_Review_Process) replacing
current bugzilla workflow.

### Enhance Fedora build setup

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:* Fedora uses the [Koji](http://koji.fedoraproject.org)
build system with GIT as a source. Plugings/scripts are needed to allow
package maintainer to be able to use own branches without accidently
deleting the source of published RPMs.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python programming skills, ideally some
packaging knowledge

*Skill level:* intermediate (programming), high (understanding/analysing
code, GNU/Linux)

*Contacts:* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till),
[Dennis Gilmore](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ausil),

*Mentor(s):*[Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till),
[Dennis Gilmore](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ausil)

*Notes:* Rough roadmap:

&#42; Make select [releng scripts](https://fedorahosted.org/rel-eng/)
PEP8 compliant/python3 ready &#42; Make other python tools PEP8
compliant, python3 ready: &#42;&#42;
[fedpkg](https://fedorahosted.org/fedpkg/) &#42;&#42;
[mash](https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/mash/) &#42;&#42;
[rpkg](https://fedorahosted.org/rpkg/) &#42; Become familiar with the
Fedora packaging workflow, maybe by packaging some software &#42; Learn
how to interface koji and write a script to get a mapping of git commit
ID to package build (name, version, release) &#42; Write a koji plugin
to enforce that pkgs can be only built from the right GIT branch for
each build target (might need improvements to koji's plugin interface as
well): <https://fedorahosted.org/rel-eng/ticket/5843> &#42; Write a
fedmsg service/cronjob to regularly tag sucessful builds in GIT:
<https://fedorahosted.org/rel-eng/ticket/5856> &#42; Help with koji2

### Improve Sigul Signing Server

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:* The [Sigul](https://fedorahosted.org/sigul/) signing
server is used by release engineering to [sign Fedora
RPMs](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_package_signing) when
[pushing fedora
updates](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/pushing_fedora_updates). There
are two major problems that make it hard to release updated packages in
a timely manner: It crashes and it cannot be used simultaneously.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python programming skills, ideally some
background knowledge about GPG, security and networking

*Skill level:* intermediate (programming), high (understanding/analysing
code, GNU/Linux)

*Contacts:* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till),
[Dennis Gilmore](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ausil), [Ralph
Bean](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ralph),

*Mentor(s):* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Till),
[Dennis Gilmore](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ausil), [Ralph
Bean](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ralph)

*Notes:* Rough roadmap:

&#42; To test whether everything works, a test instance needs to be
setup. This is rather complex because it requires interaction with koji.
Maybe it is possible to add a test instance to Infrastructure that can
use the koji staging system, but the latter is not fully functional
right now. &#42; Debug why sigul hangs sometimes when using the
[sign-rpms](https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sigul.git/tree/src/client.py&#35;n1090)
command (called by &#96;\--batch-size&#96; greater than one with
&#96;sigulsign_unsigned.py&#96; &#42; Enable sigul to process multiple
tasks at once, e.g. sign for multiple releases or architectures at once.
&#42; Fix other bugs/issues, examples: &#42;&#42; Currently
[logrotate](http://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) does not make sigul
properly re-open its logfiles, which is why sigul does not log to the
new logfile after rotation. This needs to be fixed in sigul &#42;&#42;
The GPG defaults in sigul might not be up-to-date, they should be
reviewed and improved if necessary &#42;&#42; Add support for e.g.
signing and revoking GPG keys, to build a local web of trust between
[Fedora release keys](https://getfedora.org/keys/)

### AskFedora UX/UI &amp; Functionality Overhaul {#askfedora-uxui-functionality-overhaul}

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:*

[AskFedora](https://ask.fedoraproject.org/) is a community knowledge
base and support forum and designed to be the primary place for
community support in Fedora. It is powered by Askbot, Django based web
application. The UI and the UX for AskFedora needs overhaul to give it
some uniformity with the current Fedora websites. There may also be
changes to be done in Askbot itself and have possibility of being
integrated upstream. We aim to achieve results similar to what [Ask
Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/) has achieved, however Ask Ubuntu is not
based on Askbot and similar theming techniques can't be applied.
Discussions are open for this.

\'\' But why?: \'\'Over the years of its existence, AskFedora's
popularity has increased and there are 11,000+ questions that have been
asked on the website and has 12,500+ contributors as of today (out of
which quite a few are active). We think, it really needs to \'look
good\' and \'provide a better user experience\' now.

\'\'Status right now: \'\' Mockups during the last Design Fedora
Activity Day (FAD) 2015 were done. Checkout
[this](https://suchakra.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/ask-fedora-ux-redesign-updates-1/)
and
[this](https://suchakra.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/ask-fedora-ux-redesign-updates-2/)
blogpost for latest updates on mockups. An [openshift
instance](http://askbotstg-suchakra.rhcloud.com/questions/) has also
been created and source for testing
[repository](https://github.com/fedoradesign/askbot-test) is available
for setting up your own staging instance.

*Knowledge prerequisites:* Front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) development, UI/UX
design experience, some knowledge of Django/Python

*Skill level:* Beginner/Intermediate

*Contacts:* kushal at fedoraproject dot org, suchakra at fedoraproject
dot org

*Mentor(s):* [ Kushal Das](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kushal),
[ Suchakra](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Suchakra)

*co-Mentor(s):* [ Sarup
Banskota](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sarupbanskota)

TL;DR The infra and some ideas for testing is all ready, we need someone
to improve AskFedora's UI/UX.

### Glitter Gallery Improvements

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:*

[ GlitterGallery](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design/GlitterGallery)
is GitHub for designers - being developed by and for the Fedora design
team, but hoping to be useful to all designers. It's a web app that
allows designers and artists to create, share, and collaborate, backed
by Git for version control, and intended to be part of a FLOSS design
suite that includes

&#42; [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org) - a git-backed, Dropbox
like system that will automatically check in and push files in project
directly to a shared git repo &#42; [Magic
Mockup](https://github.com/garrett/magicmockup) - a javascript library
you can insert into an SVG of mockups to enable interactive,
click-through mockups ([see a demo
here](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/2011/08/12/interactive-svg-mockups-with-inkscape-javascript/)
&#42; [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) is our preferred design tool of
choice

Last year, two GSoC students worked on a number of critical improvements
to GlitterGallery, but there is still plenty of work to be done.

&#42; Public gallery of works; currently the app requires a user to
login and to follow other users before they can see work other than
their own. They can also view direct links to works. A public gallery
can be used to browse and explore works without having to be logged in.
&#42; Better design suite integration, which could mean better support
for local editing with SparkleShare; Inkscape integration through an
extension; and/or support for creating and sharing interactive SVGs with
Magic Mockup &#42; Better commenting - the current commenting system is
basic, and there's lots of ways it could be improved, including thread
support, pingback support, the ability to reference a specific region of
a design in a comment &#42; External issue tracking - Glitter Gallery
has an integrated issue tracker, but it would be useful to also be able
to integrate with external bug/issue trackers such as GitHub and
Bugzilla. &#42; Enhanced history view - (see
<https://github.com/glittergallery/GlitterGallery/issues/187>) &#42;

### Multimonitor wallpaper submission and download for Nuancier

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Purpose for this project is to extend
[Nuancier](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/nuancier/), Fedoras
supplemental wallpaper submission application with an system that allow
to submit and downlad wallpapers for multi-monitor setup.

Knowledge prerequisite: some Python knowledge

*Skill level:* starter

### Cockpit UI for Rolekit

*Status:* Proposed *Summary of idea:* The [Rolekit
Project](https://fedorahosted.org/rolekit) provides a platform API for
deploying Server Roles onto a system. Currently, it supports creating a
Domain Controller (based on [FreeIPA](http://freeipa.org)) or a Database
Server (based on [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)). A major
component of the Fedora Server is the [Cockpit
Project](http://cockpit-project.org), a web-based management console for
servers. The goal of this effort would be to enhance the Cockpit UI so
that an administrator could deploy these Roles using rolekit via the
Cockpit web interface.

*Knowledge prerequisites:* JavaScript (ideally jQuery). Preferred
familiarity with D-BUS.

*Skill Level:* Beginner to intermediate

*Contacts:* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Mentor(s):* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Success Conditions:* A user of the Cockpit UI must be able to deploy a
Domain Controller while providing the minimum set of necessary
information to the UI. The UI must optionally allow more advanced
settings to be selected. The UI must also provide a link post-deployment
that allows the user to browse to the Domain Controller administration
UI. Providing the same functionality for the Database Server role would
be bonus functionality for this project, provided that the Domain
Controller is completed early.

### Cockpit support for systemd timers {#cockpit-support-for-systemd-timers}

*Status*: Proposed Summary of idea: systemd provides timers for calendar
time events and monotonic time events
(<http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html>,
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers>). A major
component of the Fedora Server is the Cockpit Project, a web-based
management console for servers. The goal of this effort would be to
enhance the Cockpit UI so that an administrator could deploy these Roles
using rolekit via the Cockpit web interface. Some preliminary designs
for timers in Cockpit exist at
<https://trello.com/c/1B2lZViZ/74-timers-and-cron>, although these are
just intended as guidelines to get started.

*Knowledge prerequisites*: JavaScript (ideally jQuery). Preferred
familiarity with D-BUS.

*Skill Level*: Beginner to intermediate

*Contacts*: [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Mentor(s)*: Dominik Perpeet, [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Success Conditions*: A user of the Cockpit UI must be able to view
existing timers, edit existing ones or create new timers while providing
the minimum set of necessary information to the UI. The UI must
optionally allow more advanced settings to be selected.

### Docker Volume Support in Cockpit

*Status*: Proposed Summary of idea: Docker (<https://www.docker.com/>)
allows building, running, and sharing of software in containers. A major
component of the Fedora Server is the Cockpit Project, a web-based
management console for servers. Docker is already supported in Cockpit,
including features such as downloading images, running/stopping/deleting
containers, exposing additional ports, inspecting console output as well
as linking containers. The goal of this effort would be to enhance the
Cockpit UI so that an administrator can use Docker \'Data volumes\'
(<http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/>) via the Cockpit web
interface. Some preliminary designs for Docker Volume Support in Cockpit
exist at <https://trello.com/c/4juwxCaE/94-docker-volume-support>,
although these are just intended as guidelines to get started.

*Knowledge prerequisites*: JavaScript (ideally jQuery). Preferred
familiarity with D-BUS.

*Skill Level*: Beginner to intermediate

*Contacts*: [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Mentor(s)*: Dominik Perpeet, [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

*Success Conditions*: A user of the Cockpit UI must be able to create,
view and (to a sensible extent) edit Docker \'Data Volume Containers\'
while providing the minimum set of necessary information to the UI. It
should also be possible to select host directories or host files as Data
Volumes. The UI must optionally allow more advanced settings to be
selected. Optionally this can be extended by further functionality, such
as backup, restoration or migration of data volumes.

### Shumgrepper/summershum

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Finish and deploy the shumgrepper project

*Knowledge prerequisite:* python, flask, sqlalchemy and some system
administration

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Contacts:* [Pierre-Yves
Chibon](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:pingou)

*Mentor(s):* [Pierre-Yves
Chibon](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:pingou) [Ralph
Bean](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ralph)

*Notes:* shumgrepper was started last year and offers an API to query
the data stored by summershum. This data corresponds to the md5, sha1,
sh256 and sha512 of every files in every packages in Fedora, allowing to
easily find out files duplicated in multiple packages.

Dev instance: <http://209.132.184.120/>

### fresque

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Fedora Review Server: take package reviews off
bugzilla

*Knowledge prerequisite:* python, flask, sqlalchemy and some ideas about
packaging

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Contacts:* [Aurélien
Bompard](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:abompard)

*Mentor(s):* [Aurélien
Bompard](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:abompard)

*Notes:* fresque aims at providing a dedicated application for package
(RPM) reviews. This would be integrate with a git backend and integrates
the fedora-review tool for automatic testing of new reviews and changes.

### Patch Tracker

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* One of Fedoras goals as a distribution is [staying
close to upstream
projects](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/staying_close_to_upstream_projects).
However, sometimes it is necessary for Fedora packages to deviate from
upstream, for example if upstream is dead or if a fix is backported to
an older release. Also other distributions sometimes carry patches that
are not submitted upstream but fix bugs also present in Fedora packages.
Therefore it is interesting for Fedora packagers or packagers of other
distributions to get easy access to information about patches. Fedora
already contains a web app, that shows information about patches in
Fedora, for example the [patches for the ipython
package](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ipython/sources/).
However, this is not a designated app to make the patch information as
useful as possible and does not contain support for other distros.
Debian used to provide a [patch
tracker](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/seanius/patch-tracker.git/tree/)
that is currently offline due to a missing maintainer. For other
distributions, there only [manual
methods](http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches) to find
out about patches. Therefore the idea is to create a web application
with the purpose to make it easier for others to find patches in Fedora
and to make it easier for Fedora maintainers to find patches in other
distributions. FedoraCreate/adjust a webapp to track patches that are
used in Fedora and other distributions

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python programming, web application
development

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Contacts:* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:till)

*Mentor(s):* [Till Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:till)

*Notes:* Potential features:

&#42; Show a clear overview for patches in Fedora for a certain package
&#42;&#42; Link to bugs that were mentioned, extract key information
from the bug &#42; Allow to get notifications for new patches, e.g. via
fedmsg &#42; Allow to get information about patches for the package in
other distros &#42; Try to figure out if patches are already upstream
&#42; &#8230;

Rough potential roadmap:

&#42; Get the debian patch tracker running on a test system, maybe with
some example debian packages &#42; Port it for one example Fedora
package &#42; Port it to a modern web framework such as Flask or Pyramid
&#42; Make sure it is PEP8 compliant &#42; Make it generic to work for
Fedora and Debian &#42; Add feature to patches that are present only in
Fedora or Debian &#42; Add more distros, e.g. OpenSUSE, Arch, Ubuntu,
Gentoo &#42; Add more features

Basic requirements:

&#42; Target platform is RHEL/CentOS7 with EPEL &#42; All dependencies
should be available on the target platform as RPM packages or possible
to be packaged (e.g. requiring newer versions of packages already
included in the target platform might not be easily possible) &#42; It
needs to be possible to package the final project for Fedora/EPEL, i.e.
there may not be bundled libraries included &#42; The code needs to be
PEP8 compliant and contain proper docstrings &#42; Proper automtatic
tests should be included to allow meaningful continuous integration

Recommended basic knowledge:

&#42; Know about PEP8, pylint, continuous integration, &#42; Understand
the different diff formats

### Better OVAL development tools in OpenSCAP

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org) project
implements the Security Content Automation Protocol standards. It
provides users with a way to automatically audit their infrastructure.
One of the standards is OVAL - Open Vulnerability and Assessment
Language - it is the language in which the automated checks are written.
Unfortunately the check authors have it tough right now. They have to
edit XML files manually, there is no debugger, no static analysis of any
sort (like pylint or cppcheck). To make matters worse the OVAL checks
are hard to write and the learning curve is steep.

*Knowledge prerequisites:* Intermediate C, familiarity with the OpenSCAP
project

*Skill Level:* Intermediate

*Contacts:* [Martin
Preisler](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mpreisle)

*Mentor(s):* [Martin
Preisler](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mpreisle)

*Success Conditions:* SCAP content developers are able to interactively
debug their checks, they can browse the execution, looking at inputs and
outputs of each step. They are able to analyze their OVAL content for
common mistakes using the lint-like tool. Such common mistakes include
ID mismatches, wrong usage of regexes, &#8230;

### Fix bugs in packages that break compiling as position independent {#fix-bugs-in-packages-that-break-compiling-as-position-independent-executable}

executable

*Status:* proposed

*Summary of idea:* Starting with Fedora 23, Fedora will try to ship all
binaries as [position independent
executable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) to
benefit from the [address space layout randomization
(ASLR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)
of the Linux kernel to increase the security of Fedoras packages.
However, not all code/packages are ready for this, therefore the
[current change
proposal](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Harden_all_packages_with_position-independent_code)
plans to handle these cases by just disabling this improvement for
affected packages. Ideally all packages would be fixed to not require it
to be disabled, this is where you can help.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* low-level programming skills, compiler
development, build systems configuration, maybe python programming
skills

*Skill level:* intermediate to high, depending on the actual problem

*Contacts:* [Orion
Poplawski](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Orion), [Till
Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:till), [Dhiru
Kholia](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:halfie),

*Mentor(s):* [Orion
Poplawski](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Orion), [Till
Maas](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:till), [Dhiru
Kholia](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:halfie)

*Notes:* Currently not all Fedora packages were rebuilt with the new
hardening flags, therefore it is not yet clear how many packages need to
be fixed. However, it might be that there are also some languages that
need to be adjusted in general to produce position-independent code (for
example go), so adding support to (some) of these languages would be in
the scope of this project as well, after all build failures were
handled. Additionally Fedora tools like [Fedora
Review](https://fedorahosted.org/FedoraReview/) and Taskotron should be
adapted to properly report packages that are not built with the
hardening flags for example by running checkseck on all created
executables.

Example problems that block some packages to be built with the right
flags:

&#42; <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1199775>

builds](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Mock_to_test_package_builds)

### Enhance PostgreSQL GSSAPI Support

*Status:* proposed

*Summary of idea:* The Fedora Server Edition includes a Database Server
Role powered by a PostgreSQL database. In order to integrate it better
with Fedora Server's Domain Controller, we want to enhance the GSSAPI
authentication and communication in the server.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C Programming, Kerberos/GSSAPI

*Skill level:* intermediate to high (probably grad-student level)

*Contacts:* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh), [Simo
Sorce](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Simo)

*Mentor(s):* [Simo Sorce](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Simo)

*Notes:* This will require modifications to the authentication subsystem
as well as the TCP/IP layer of PostgreSQL. It will likely be a very
involved project.

### Tweak specific packages to play well with MIPS architecture

*Status:* proposed

*Summary of idea:* We are planning to bootstrap Fedora for MIPS
architecture. Even though the majority of packages should build with
little to no modifications, there are some challenging packages that
will need extra attention.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C or Python Programming, packaging basics,
some idea about non-x86 architectures

*Skill level:* intermediate to high

*Contacts:* [Michal Toman](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mtoman),

[YunQiang Su](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:wzssyqa)

*Mentor(s):* [Michal Toman](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mtoman)

*Notes:* Possible work areas:

## Students {#students}

Students who are looking for challenges and would like to contribute to
the worlds\' leading and innovative Linux Distro, this could be the
chance. Please feel free to contact and refer to the material and start
contacting mentors.

1.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real world large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Create life time connections.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various positions. This is just an example, as experience
and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is influential on your
career in many ways.

As long-standing communities with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being productively lost. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

### Step-by-step guide for students {#step-by-step-guide-for-students}

2.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

&#42; It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the
student is successful or not, which affects payment.

## Ideas Page {#ideas-page}

&#42;Status :&#42; Done\
&#42;Link :&#42; [Summer coding ideas for 2014](ideas.xml)

We encourage students to provide creative yet useful ideas towards the
Fedora project as well. Please use [Student
Idea](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2014/Students_Idea)
page to note your idea. The idea will be moved to the original idea page
once the idea is picked by a mentor.

## Policy on proposal submissions on non-related project ideas {#policy-on-proposal-submissions-on-non-related-project-ideas}

Over the past period we have observed that few students tend to submit
proposals for their own ideas directly to Google-melange. There will be
no communication after then even we ask more info on Google-melange.
Such nature of submissions need extra effort when it comes to manage
proposals on Google-Melange. Therefore as a policy, proposals for
students ideas (with no supporting mentor indicated) that are being
submitted directly to Google-melange will be marked &#42;Ignore&#42;
after a 24 hours of warning unless the students does not voluntary
withdraw the proposal or explain basis of their idea.\
This will not restrict submitting proposals on students ideas, we always
welcome novel and innovative ideas from students if they follow the
right path. As the first step send us your idea and will start discuss
how to manage it. If you have a supporting mentor for your own idea
please feel free to submit it directly to Google-melange and clearly
note the mentors\' contact details.

## Idea list for GSoC 2014

### FedmsgSobumper

*Status:* Proposed (as a maturity level in
[RFC6410](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6410))

*Summary of idea:* Automatically rebuild the whole dependency subtree in
rawhide if any ABI-backwards-incompatible so-bump occures.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, shell

*Skill level:* Low-Medium

*Contacts:* jpacner @ @ redhat @ @ com

*Mentor(s):* jpacner @ @ redhat @ @ com

*Notes:* The script will be hooked to [Fedmsg
bus](http://www.fedmsg.com/en/latest/) and should be as small as
possible (for details, please contact the mentor). This will save
rawhide contributors much time.

### Bugspad

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Bugspad is a bug tracking system designed keeping
performance in mind. The target is to keep same level of features like
Bugzilla but people should be able to host it in a standard vm. It
should also require less configuration and maintainence. For a test
evaluation goal we want to have all Fedora bugs and but better
performance from current Bugzilla.

Project details can be found at
<http://bugspad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>

Minimal required TODO

&#42; Fully working frontend, primary idea is to go fully selfhosted.
All bugs should be filed in that instance against Bugspad.

*Knowledge prerequisite:*

&#96; &#42; Good idea on web applications and frontend design. &#96;\
&#96; &#42; The person should know about API(s) in general and how to design them well. &#96;\
&#96; &#42; Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS will be the primary languages to deal with.&#96;

*Skill level:* Medium-High

*Contacts:* kushal AT fedoraproject DOT org

*Mentor(s):* Kushal Das

*Notes:* The backend is written in golang. Before you start talking have
at least one instance up somewhere (hints: your laptop).

### Waartaa

&#42;Status:&#42; Proposed

&#42;Summary of idea:&#42; Waartaa is an open source communication tool
for teams and groups. It is built on top of IRC. Currently, Waartaa is
an IRC client as a service and it supports centralized logging, 24x7
idling, notifications and unique identity to a user on IRC. You can
visit the project's homepage: <https://www.waartaa.com> for more
details. A demo instance of Waartaa is hosted at
<https://try.waartaa.com>.

Roadmap:

&#42; Build a central hub for searching/reading channel logs for Open
Source communities and projects. &#42; Build a faster and scalable
backend. &#42; Freedom of choice: Expose an API so that users can use
their existing IRC clients with waartaa. &#42; Find a secure way to
authenticate with IRC services without storing RAW passwords. &#42;
Respect user privacy: user personal messages should be stored in an
encrypted format in the server. &#42; Allow users to download chat logs
in various formats compatible with popular IRC clients. &#42; HTML5
mobile app &#42; VCS, Bugzilla and other task management tools
integration. &#42; Video/audio conference facility on top of HTML5 and
JS technologies.

&#42;Knowledge prerequisite:&#42; Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

### Afterthought

&#42;Status:&#42; Proposed

&#42;Summary of idea:&#42; Afterthought will be the tool to run (not
predefined) jobs on &#42;nix systems. At very high level, it will take
an URI as argument, fetch the data of the URI, strip/parse the formatted
data (with instruction sets) &amp; execute the commands/jobs. This makes
automating tasks, server/application deployments so much easy.

By operation, one can simply consider it as a *dynamic*, *lazy-loaded*
shell-script. When running a script it follows the routines put in it at
the creation time (which may have been obsoleted at the time of
execution); whereas, &#42;afterthought&#42; fetches the latest routines,
which would be the latest route-to-follow for the operation - without
the user needing to worry about it (or get the \'latest\' script).

Other possibilities include, configuring a base procedure customized to
particular needs, profiles and/or credentials. And the endpoint doesn't
need to reply the same on 2020 for a Fedora Machine with Clang, as it
did on 2015 for a CentOS rig with GCC - if you know get what I mean.
Other such possibilities are:

&#96; \$ afterthought &#96;[&#96;http://zomg.app/install&#96;](http://zomg.app/install)\
&#96; \$ afterthought &#96;[&#96;https://le-wild-github.app/username/pushes/to/ci&#96;](https://le-wild-github.app/username/pushes/to/ci)\
&#96; \$ afterthought &#96;[&#96;https://thoughtpolice.tld/openshift/deploy?user=id&amp;code=github.com/foo/bar&#96;](https://thoughtpolice.tld/openshift/deploy?user=id&amp;code=github.com/foo/bar)\
&#96; \$ afterthought &#96;[&#96;https://thoughtpolice.tld/user/?profile=setup-irc-bouncer-on-my-raspberry-pidora&#96;](https://thoughtpolice.tld/user/?profile=setup-irc-bouncer-on-my-raspberry-pidora)\
&#96; \$ afterthought &#96;[&#96;https://thoughtpolice.tld/user/?profile=run-httpd-server-on-a-docker-image-of-fedora&#96;](https://thoughtpolice.tld/user/?profile=run-httpd-server-on-a-docker-image-of-fedora)

OR maybe, in a Dockerfile

&#96; CMD \[\'afterthought\', \'&#96;[&#96;http://thoughthacker.tld/rule-the-world&#35;plan-TBD-but-this-image-ships-today&#96;](http://thoughthacker.tld/rule-the-world&#35;plan-TBD-but-this-image-ships-today)&#96;\'\]&#96;

So, all in all - less RTFM, less maintenance (or chasing ghost of the
past routines/scripts), more automation - wherever applies (hint:
applies in way too many places).

### Shumgrepper

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:* summershum is a project collecting the md5sum,
sha1sum and sha512sum of every file in every package in Fedora. This
would allow detecting how many time we bundle certain files or how many
different copies of the GPL license are present. Shumgreppper would be
the web frontend/json-api to this data. The idea would be to fork the
code present in
[datagrepper](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper) and adjust it
to work on top of summershum.

### Glitter Gallery Improvements {#glitter-gallery-improvements}

*Status:* Proposed - draft

*Summary of idea:*

[ GlitterGallery](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design/GlitterGallery)
is GitHub for designers. It's a web app that allows designers and
artists to create, share, and collaborate, backed by Git for version
control, and intended to be part of a FLOSS design suite that includes

&#42; [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org) - a git-backed, Dropbox
like system that will automatically check in and push files in project
directly to a shared git repo &#42; [Magic
Mockup](https://github.com/garrett/magicmockup) - a
coffeescript/javascript you can insert into an SVG of mockups to enable
interactive, click-through mockups ([see a demo
here](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/2011/08/12/interactive-svg-mockups-with-inkscape-javascript/)
) &#42; [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) is our preferred design tool of
choice

Last year, a successful GSoC took Glitter Gallery from a prototype to a
fully featured web app, but there are still plenty of features to be
added, and improvements to be made. Some things that still need work:

&#42; Transitioning to test-driven development, which means writing unit
and integration tests for all of the components &#42; Better design
suite integration, which could mean better support for local editing
with SparkleShare; Inkscape integration through an extension; and/or
support for creating and sharing interactive SVGs with Magic Mockup
&#42; UI improvements - the current UI is functional and pretty nice
looking, but it could be more responsive and polished &#42; Better
commenting - the current commenting system is basic, and there's lots of
ways it could be improved, including thread support, pingback support,
the ability to reference a specific region of a design in a comment
&#42; Issue tracking - allow the designer to track requested changes as
issues &#42; More social features - such as the ability to follow a
file/project/user, an activity feed, private messaging, easy sharing
outside the application &#42; Your own ideas

*Knowledge prerequisite:* git, Ruby on Rails, front-end (HTML/CSS/JS)
development, design experience would be great but optional

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Mentor(s):* [ Emily Dirsh](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Emichan)

*Notes:* The [GlitterGallery
repository](https://github.com/glittergallery/GlitterGallery) is hosted
on GitHub. GlitterGallery will run locally, but due to a dependency,
isn't yet compatible with ruby 2.0.0 which is the version provided with
the latest Fedora release - you can install an older version of ruby
with rvm. Ruby 1.9.3 is recommended. GlitterGallery can also be deployed
on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com).

### Fedora College

### Infrastructure for FreeMedia group

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Fedora freemedia is a group of volunteers who ship
fedora media on request to users worldwide. They use Trac to track these
requests. The process is manual, the idea is to automate the process as
much as possible.

### Collaboration projects with other organizations

&#42; TBA

### Muon -- KDE package management

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The current package manager front-end used in Fedora
KDE, Apper, is unmaintained and full of bugs. Muon OTOH is under active
development. It has originally been written for Kubuntu and was tied to
Apt but it gained a preminarily PackageKit back-end in 2013. The idea is
to make Muon 2.1 ready for production use in Fedora.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C++, Qt/KDE development

*Skill level:* Medium

*Contacts:* <https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/sysadmin/muon>

*Mentor(s):* ?? (Aleix Pol Gonzalez is a confirmed mentor for a [similar
Debian
proposal](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2014/Projects/Get%20Muon%20ready))

*Notes:*
[Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2014/Projects/Get%20Muon%20ready)
has a similar proposal. Even though that one would focus on the Apt
back-end, their tasks of cleaning up *ubuntuisms* would benefit Fedora
as well.

### Mock improvements

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* This project is about improving [mock
utility](https://fedorahosted.org/mock/) used in building packages in
Fedora and some other RPM-based distributions. It focuses on improving
interactive mock use cases to improve packaging workflows.

Some ideas for mock improvement:

Add real-time logging to TTY

:   Improve interactive mock use by logging more things to console in
    real time. Things like DNF output or build logs should be
    considered.

Implement LVM-based root cache

:   Currently mock creates root directory tree under existing file
    system and caches chroot as compressed tarball, which has negative
    performance impact. The idea is to use LVM logical volume to store
    guest file system. Cache would be created by creating LVM snapshot,
    which could be later restored.

Use DNF instead of yum and yum-builddep

:   Mock uses YUM and YUM Utils to install initial packages and build
    dependencies. The idea is to replace all YUM usage with DNF.

As DNF is still in development, it is expected to have a few bugs
related to installroot support, which may have to be fixed and
contributed to DNF project.

Improve chroot locking

:   Currently most of mock operations inside chroot are performed after
    acquiring exclusive lock. This makes it impossible to run two
    separate shells inside mock. The idea is to implement read-write
    (shared-exclusive) locking scheme. Some operations (like creating
    chroot or restoring snapshot) would need exclusive lock, other would
    need just shared lock (like running a shell).

*Notes:*

### Git shell prompt daemon

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Fedora packaging is heavily dependant on git. Without
specialized git tools, maintenance of tens or hundreds of Fedora
packages can become tedious.

This project is about implementing a deamon which would listen on named
pipe to requests from system shell (like bash) and it would respond with
command line prompt dependant on context (like status of git repository
in given directory) and user configuration.

The core of the daemon should not rely on git, but instead be written
using plugin framework allowing different plugins to be implemented.
Each plugin could provide different information to be displayed in shell
prompt.

Besides the core, a git plugin should be implemented. This plugin should
not call git executable, but instead use a git library (such as libgit2
which has bindings for many languages).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Git, Linux, any programming language which has
bindings for [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/)

### Improving Fedora Packager for Eclipse

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* This project is about implementing new Eclipse
plugins and contrubuting them to
[eclipse-fedorapackager](https://fedorahosted.org/eclipse-fedorapackager/)
project.

Copr integration

:   This plugin should provide interface for
    [Copr](https://fedorahosted.org/copr/). It should allow obtaining
    API token using login/password, launching builds, querying build
    statuses. Ideally full Copr API would be implemented, even if it is
    not used in GUI. This plugin should provide command(s) in Fedora
    Packaging perspective.

Fedora Infrastructure Message Bus integration

:   This plugin should provide Java API and implementation for
    [datagrepper](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/). It
    should also provide a SWT widget which would allow accessing past
    events and filtering them by specified criteria. Optional Mylyn
    integration is also welcome (for example failing build creates a
    Mylyn task).

### Eclipse plugin for XMvn

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* This project ia about creating an Eclipse plugin for
editing [XMvn](http://mizdebsk.fedorapeople.org/xmvn/)
[configuration](http://mizdebsk.fedorapeople.org/xmvn/site/config.html)
in Eclipse.

The plugin should:

&#42; implement Java model(s) for XMvn configuration &#42; allow reading
and writing model(s) as XML files &#42; implement configuration editor
providing raw XML view and one or more high-level views &#42; allow
converting configuration to sequence of RPM macro calls

XMvn plugin should integrate with Eclipse Linux Tools and/or Fedora
Packager for Eclipse where possible (adding commands in perspectives,
integration with spec file editor etc.)

### Implement a battery of unit tests for SSSD

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The purpose of this project is to develop a suite of
unit tests for the SSSD. The unit tests would leverage mock objects to
be able to exercise code that is otherwise only ever reachable when the
SSSD is connected to the network. Contributing the set of unit tests to
the SSSD would greatly improve its stability long-term and would help
raise confidence when pushing new SSSD versions into Fedora or other
distributions.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python scripting, Linux system services
knowledge, basic LDAP knowledge is helpful but not needed.

## Open Idea list from GSoC 2013

### Applications for desktop end users

These are coding projects that benefit end users of the Linux desktop.

#### Integrate Proxy Settings and Network Connections(Locations)

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The system should use an appropriate networking
profile (e.g. Proxy settings) for each network connection.

Gnome 2 had a concept of network locations in its Network Proxy
configuration window. However, user should selected the appropriate
location whenever he moves between networks. This idea is about
providing an integration between NetworkManager and Desktop environments
so that a user can create network profiles for each network
location(connection) providing appropriate settings like proxy settings
which is the main proposed setting here. NetworkManager can have a
\'Network Location\' concept: for wireless networks, usually the name of
the network (ESSID) is usually enough. For wired connections, DHCP
servers can and usually do provide network's domain name, which can be
used as the name of the location. It is nice if a user can associate
each network location with a network settings profile which will be used
whenever the user is connected to that network automatically. So, when
you connect to a network, a corresponding network settings profile is
activated automatically.

*Knowledge prerequisite:*

*Skill level:*

*Contacts:* [Hedayat
Vatankhah](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Hedayat)

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* There is an entry with some description in [NetworkManager
TODO](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/TODO)
which should be considered for the implementation

#### Assemble a toolchain for recording screencasts easily

*Status:* Proposed - Draft - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* Creating screencasts on Fedora and post-processing
them for upload should be easy and fool proof.

The [Fedora Videos](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Videos) project has
been launched to bring together a collection of screencasts that help
people learn how to use Fedora. There's only one major hurdle, though.
Capturing really good screencasts on Fedora, post-processing them to
include an intro and outro and other effects, and finally exporting them
to an open format is challenging. There are lots of different tools, but
each one only gets you part of the way there and you have to be the glue
to make it all work. And then there are the bugs.

The goal of this project is to assemble a toolchain (a recommended
collection of software available in the Fedora repositories) and write a
comprehensive tutorial for how to create an professional-looking
screencast. That may included chasing down &amp; fixing bugs in the
existing tools, discovering new tools and getting them packaged and
learning about techniques in the environment around the computer, such
as how to select &amp; setup a microphone or how to draft a good
speaking script. One possible task in the project is to add sound
recording support to the Gnome 3 desktop recorder. Currently, the
desktop recorder only grabs the video of the screen.

The student will get support and advice from the Fedora Videos team
since they are trying to learn how to create these screencasts.

#### Improve Fedora's Tablet User Experience

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Improving Fedora's Tablet User Experience.

The window managers/desktop environments officially supported by Fedora
do not match the expectations of people with low power touch devices.

Fedora features new technology to reduce system load and - requirements,
the user interface has not seen too much love.

Currently available interfaces for users are:

&#42; Too Ressource Consuming &#42; Too Overloaded or &#42; Too Feature
Poor &#42; Not Customizable With Reasonable Effort

The E17 Desktop Shell, developed as part of the [Enlightenment
Project](http://www.enlightenment.org), is a perfect match. It provides
a rich interface, whilst consuming very little ressources. The
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, on which E17 is built upon, were
chosen as Foundation Block of Tizen, the MeeGo successor backed by
Samsung and Intel. If things work out, E17 will be the first \'real\'
Desktop Shell for Wayland.

Though it already provides [special
behaviour](http://dev.enlightenment.fr/~captainigloo/2011/08/25/elfe-and-the-composited-windows-list/)
for touchscreen devices through certain modules, there's still room for
improvement.

The overall goal of this project would be to improve the user experience
of people who want to use Fedora on low power devices such as tablets.

The student will get support and advice from the Enlightenment Project
developers.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, X11, Wayland, Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries

*Skill level:* Medium to High

*Contacts:* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so), [ Leif
Middelschulte](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:leif) (leif \[dot\]
middelschulte \[at\] student \[dot\] kit \[dot\] edu)

*Mentor(s):* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so)

*Notes:* If this idea gets realized, a proper tablet spin can be
created, that honors the spirit of Fedora.

### Applications for programmers

#### Implement a binding translator for GlusterFS

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In transporting data across networks, programmers
need GlusterFS language bindings to be able to create apps in their
language of choice. A language binding translator would greatly increase
the number of programmers who would be able to more easily extend
GlusterFS. It's also a fun project for someone wanting to get some
experience with multi-threaded architecture and design in the context of
distributed systems and data.

#### Implement a Cassandra/NoSQL Connector or Translator for GlusterFS

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In general, there is a need for the ability to store
and access NoSQL data on general purpose distributed filesystems.
Currently, there are a host of single-purpose methods for storing and
retrieving NoSQL data, which are difficult to access from legacy
applications. Creating a NoSQL translator for GlusterFS would help
mitigate this problem and give developers more options for storing and
accessing \'big data\' in a way that is accessible via a variety of
standard toolkits and protocols.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, GlusterFS internals

### Linux kernel project

#### Implement nfs/fscache writeback cache (Dropped)

*Status:* Dropped --- This is a GSoC *2012* idea and is being working on
by Hongyi Jia although he didn't get the GSoC slot
(<http://www.jiayi.net/works/nfsfscache-writeback-cache/>). So, I'm not
going to mentor the idea this year and if anyone is really interested in
it, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to answer questions:-)

*Summary of idea:* Currently, the flashcache/bcache only works for local
filesystems. For network filesystems, nfs only supports write through
cache based on fscache/cachefiles. With wider adoption of SSD on nfs
client side, it would be great for nfs to support writeback cache to
speed up write intensive clients. This project would implement a
writeback mechanism for nfs, which need to make necessary changes to
kernel nfs, fscache and cachefiles modules, and take care of nfs
close-to-open semantics.

### Improving Fedora packaging

#### AUR Clone for Fedora

*Status:* Proposed - Students\' Idea - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* The idea is to make an AUR clone for Fedora where
users can submit buildfiles, which need to be hosted. These set of files
can compile packages on the user side, and installed locally.

The benefit of this method is:

1.  No need to host the entire packages (saving space on servers hosting
    the RPMs)

2.  Make changes to the buildfile, and not compile the package

3.  Can pull sources from any version control system/stored tarballs to
    make a very upto-date package. (See blog entry for an example)

*Contacts:* [Anuj More](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anujmore)

*Notes:* Need mentor. Need advice on feasibility of the software and
issues that can arise. Also, read the extensive blog post on [my
blog](http://execat.blogspot.in/2012/03/aur-clone-for-fedora.html).

Analogy: This is a lot like \'having your own library\' vs \'getting a
book from a bookstore\'. If you refer a book often, you'd keep it in
your library. This would occupy space and consume resources. Otherwise,
you'd just pull out a separate paper with instructions about the
bookstore to find the book, and fetch the book from the store. Though
the first method is hassle-free, it is not possible to have all the
books in the world with you.

#### Maven FOSS Repository Extension

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* With the inception of Maven we have a means to
standardize the building of Java projects. However it has also resulted
in the usage of a very wide dependency set by these Java projects. This
makes it very hard to integrate those projects on a single platform (be
it Fedora or JBoss Application Server (or the combination)).

In essence during packaging all these dependencies must be lined up to
form a single consistent component set. Thus each project will only have
those components available which are actually available on the target
platform. This is very hard to enforce using standard Maven setup.

For Fedora I'm envisioning a Maven extension that makes sure only
sanctioned components are used during the build (without putting a
burden on the packager). This will allow developers who are not on
Fedora to also build with this extension and thus verify (and fix)
issues which are the result of \'Fedora packaging\'.

A prototype can be viewed at [Maven FOSS Repository
Extension](https://github.com/fmvn/foss-maven).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Knowledge of Maven

### Fedora Spins and remixes

#### Educational Application for Fedora Robotics Suite

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Create an educational app introducing software from
Fedora Robotics Suite

The [Fedora Robotics SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Robotics)
is creating a [Robotics
Suite](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RoboticsSuite) consisting
of many packages useful in robotics. We want to develop a demonstration
application introducing new users step by step to core packages like
[Fawkes](http://www.fawkesrobotics.org) and
[Player/Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net). It would feature
multiple game-like levels with increasing complexity. The general task
would be to instruct the robot to fulfill a specific task in a
simulation environment.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Developing this requires a strong background
in C++, a background in robotics is preferred but not necessary. You
should be able to familiarize yourself with new software quickly. User
visible parts will require GUI programming using Gtkmm.

*Skill level:* Medium to High

### Applications for systems administrators

#### Improving the RHQ-PyAgent to interface with OpenLMI

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Improve the current RHQ-PyAgent written in Python
that interfaces RHQ with OpenLMI to pick up metrics that are provided by
OpenLMI from Fedora or RHEL systems. The agent is talking to the RHQ
server via the REST api and push metrics to RHQ etc. This agent
does/will not implement the full functionality of the RHQ java agent.
The previous work is already pretty good, but it is cumbersome to add
new OpenLMI-enabled servers and the types of the data model. The work of
this year should concentrate on automating that process - perhaps after
providing a range of IP addresses to query for servers. Similar for
resource types, the agent would talk to the server to see what types are
available and then check with the OpenLMI provider if this supports the
same.

While RHQ is written in Java, this project does not require any Java
knowledge.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, Linux system administration,
principles of REST

*Skill level:* Medium to High

*Contacts:* Heiko Rupp

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real world large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Create life time connections.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various positions. This is just an example, as experience
and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is influential on your
career in many ways.

As long-standing communities with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being productively lost. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

2.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

&#42; It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstream. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the
student is successful or not, which affects payment.

## Idea list for GSoC 2013

### Collaboration projects with MATE project

#### GTK3 support

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is the cross-platform widget
toolkit used in MATE to create graphical user interfaces. GTK3, released
in 2011, and in Fedora since F14, brings a lot of improvements. Add GTK3
support to MATE, keeping the traditional desktop metaphor, is one of the
goals of the MATE Desktop project.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, GTK.

*Skill level:* Medium

#### Wayland support in marco window manager

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Wayland is a next generation display server protocol
with the aim to replace the old X server. With Wayland, the window
managers will become display servers and compositors at same time, using
the Wayland library. Wayland is already available in Fedora, and KDE and
GNOME already are moving in this direction, so this could be a great
improvement for both MATE and Fedora.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, X11.

*Skill level:* High

### Collaboration projects with Geeklog project

Please note that only &#42;one&#42; of the following Geeklog projects
will be accepted under the Fedora umbrella!

#### Geeklog: Install Script Refinements

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The install script is one of the very first things a
new Geeklog user encounters. Therefore, it is important that it is easy
to use, supports the user in installing, updating and migrating a
Geeklog site while being robust and providing helpful hints and error
messages.

The current install script was originally implemented as a GSoC project
in 2007 and further improved upon in GSoC 2008. We are still pretty
happy with it, but there's always room for improvement. And this is what
this GSoC project is about - we are looking for an *evolution*, not a
*revolution*.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* PHP, MySQL (possibly also PostgreSQL and MS
SQL), basic webserver knowledge

*Skill level:* Low - Medium

*Contacts:* [Dirk Haun](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:dhaun)

*Mentor(s):* [Dirk Haun](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:dhaun)

*Notes:*

#### Geeklog: Crowdsourcing Translations

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Geeklog has been translated into over 30 languages,
but many of those translations haven't been updated in a while. The
current way of editing a PHP file is just too awkward, error prone, and
not very intuitive (since you can't see the context in which a text
string is used).

We're looking for a way to make translating Geeklog easier, especially
for people who do not have a knowledge of PHP. Also, for new
translations, the sheer amount of text to translate can be discouraging.
The idea is to address both of these problems by crowdsourcing.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* PHP, SQL, JavaScript

*Skill level:* Medium - High

*Contacts:* [Dirk Haun](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:dhaun)

*Mentor(s):* [Dirk Haun](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:dhaun)

*Notes:*
<http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/SoC_crowdsourcing_translations>

#### Geeklog: Provide PHP Session Handling

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Geeklog currently uses custom session management to
maintain users session information. The custom session implementation is
antique and needs to be upgraded to a fully supported session management
system such as the one provided by PHP Sessions. The implementation
needs to be secure and should cache user data between page loads of a
session.

Given Geeklog's focus on security, this implementation must be hardened
against the usual attacks.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* PHP, PHP / Web Security

*Skill level:* Medium - High

### Applications for desktop end users {#applications-for-desktop-end-users}

These are coding projects that benefit end users of the Linux desktop.

#### Integrate Proxy Settings and Network Connections(Locations) {#integrate-proxy-settings-and-network-connectionslocations}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The system should use an appropriate networking
profile (e.g. Proxy settings) for each network connection.

Gnome 2 had a concept of network locations in its Network Proxy
configuration window. However, user should selected the appropriate
location whenever he moves between networks. This idea is about
providing an integration between NetworkManager and Desktop environments
so that a user can create network profiles for each network
location(connection) providing appropriate settings like proxy settings
which is the main proposed setting here. NetworkManager can have a
\'Network Location\' concept: for wireless networks, usually the name of
the network (ESSID) is usually enough. For wired connections, DHCP
servers can and usually do provide network's domain name, which can be
used as the name of the location. It is nice if a user can associate
each network location with a network settings profile which will be used
whenever the user is connected to that network automatically. So, when
you connect to a network, a corresponding network settings profile is
activated automatically.

*Notes:* There is an entry with some description in [NetworkManager
TODO](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/TODO)
which should be considered for the implementation

#### Web hosting control panel {#web-hosting-control-panel}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* develop a free alternative of cpanel / plesk control
panels, 100% compatible with fedora, and redhat enterprise Linux.
written in python.

the control panel will be able to create domains and automatically setup
apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, postgresql bind etc&#8230;

*Knowledge prerequisite:* apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, postgresql,
proftpd, bind

#### Assemble a toolchain for recording screencasts easily {#assemble-a-toolchain-for-recording-screencasts-easily}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* Creating screencasts on Fedora and post-processing
them for upload should be easy and fool proof.

The [Fedora Videos](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Videos) project has
been launched to bring together a collection of screencasts that help
people learn how to use Fedora. There's only one major hurdle, though.
Capturing really good screencasts on Fedora, post-processing them to
include an intro and outro and other effects, and finally exporting them
to an open format is challenging. There are lots of different tools, but
each one only gets you part of the way there and you have to be the glue
to make it all work. And then there are the bugs.

The goal of this project is to assemble a toolchain (a recommended
collection of software available in the Fedora repositories) and write a
comprehensive tutorial for how to create an professional-looking
screencast. That may included chasing down &amp; fixing bugs in the
existing tools, discovering new tools and getting them packaged and
learning about techniques in the environment around the computer, such
as how to select &amp; setup a microphone or how to draft a good
speaking script. One possible task in the project is to add sound
recording support to the Gnome 3 desktop recorder. Currently, the
desktop recorder only grabs the video of the screen.

The student will get support and advice from the Fedora Videos team
since they are trying to learn how to create these screencasts.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* gstreamer, video and sound editing, blender

*Skill level:* Medium

#### Improve Fedora's Tablet User Experience {#improve-fedoras-tablet-user-experience}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Improving Fedora's Tablet User Experience.

The window managers/desktop environments officially supported by Fedora
do not match the expectations of people with low power touch devices.

Fedora features new technology to reduce system load and - requirements,
the user interface has not seen too much love.

Currently available interfaces for users are:

&#42; Too Ressource Consuming &#42; Too Overloaded or &#42; Too Feature
Poor &#42; Not Customizable With Reasonable Effort

The E17 Desktop Shell, developed as part of the [Enlightenment
Project](http://www.enlightenment.org), is a perfect match. It provides
a rich interface, whilst consuming very little ressources. The
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, on which E17 is built upon, were
chosen as Foundation Block of Tizen, the MeeGo successor backed by
Samsung and Intel. If things work out, E17 will be the first \'real\'
Desktop Shell for Wayland.

Though it already provides [special
behaviour](http://dev.enlightenment.fr/~captainigloo/2011/08/25/elfe-and-the-composited-windows-list/)
for touchscreen devices through certain modules, there's still room for
improvement.

The overall goal of this project would be to improve the user experience
of people who want to use Fedora on low power devices such as tablets.

The student will get support and advice from the Enlightenment Project
developers.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, X11, Wayland, Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries

*Skill level:* Medium to High

*Contacts:* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so), [ Leif

*Mentor(s):* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so)

*Notes:* If this idea gets realized, a proper tablet spin can be
created, that honors the spirit of Fedora.

### Applications for programmers {#applications-for-programmers}

#### Implement a binding translator for GlusterFS {#implement-a-binding-translator-for-glusterfs}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In transporting data across networks, programmers
need GlusterFS language bindings to be able to create apps in their
language of choice. A language binding translator would greatly increase
the number of programmers who would be able to more easily extend
GlusterFS. It's also a fun project for someone wanting to get some
experience with multi-threaded architecture and design in the context of
distributed systems and data.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, Python, embedded Python

*Notes:* -

#### Implement a Cassandra/NoSQL Connector or Translator for GlusterFS {#implement-a-cassandranosql-connector-or-translator-for-glusterfs}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In general, there is a need for the ability to store
and access NoSQL data on general purpose distributed filesystems.
Currently, there are a host of single-purpose methods for storing and
retrieving NoSQL data, which are difficult to access from legacy
applications. Creating a NoSQL translator for GlusterFS would help
mitigate this problem and give developers more options for storing and
accessing \'big data\' in a way that is accessible via a variety of
standard toolkits and protocols.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, GlusterFS internals

*Skill level:* High

#### Embedded Cli tool for most popular DBMS {#embedded-cli-tool-for-most-popular-dbms}

*Status:* Proposed - Students\' Idea - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* Today, many developers are working with different
DBMS. I propose to develop a common command line interface for most
popular databases. For example: MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Java, JDBC, MySQL, Oracle Database,
PostgreSQL.

### Linux kernel project {#linux-kernel-project}

#### Implement nfs/fscache writeback cache (Dropped) {#implement-nfsfscache-writeback-cache-dropped}

*Status:* Dropped --- This is a GSoC *2012* idea and is being working on
by Hongyi Jia although he didn't get the GSoC slot
(<http://www.jiayi.net/works/nfsfscache-writeback-cache/>). So, I'm not
going to mentor the idea this year and if anyone is really interested in
it, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to answer questions:-)

*Summary of idea:* Currently, the flashcache/bcache only works for local
filesystems. For network filesystems, nfs only supports write through
cache based on fscache/cachefiles. With wider adoption of SSD on nfs
client side, it would be great for nfs to support writeback cache to
speed up write intensive clients. This project would implement a
writeback mechanism for nfs, which need to make necessary changes to
kernel nfs, fscache and cachefiles modules, and take care of nfs
close-to-open semantics.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, Linux kernel, nfs

### Infrastructure for Fedora contributors and users {#infrastructure-for-fedora-contributors-and-users}

#### Design Hub: FLOSS Collaboration for FLOSS Designers

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Free software designers don't have a great set of
tools to work with to collaborate with each other and with the community
on their design work. With this project, we'd like to make progress
towards fixing that. We have some disparate ideas / tools that we'd like
to be integrated:

&#42; [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org) - a git-backed, Dropbox
like system that will automatically check in and push files in project
directly to a shared git repo &#42; [Magic
Mockup](https://github.com/garrett/magicmockup) - a
coffeescript/javascript you can insert into an SVG of mockups to enable
interactive, click-through mockups ([see a demo
here](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/2011/08/12/interactive-svg-mockups-with-inkscape-javascript/)
&#42; [Design Hub](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/category/design-hub/) - an
idea and a ruby on rails prototype of a web front end that could
potentially serve as a front end to git repos with design assets
&#42;and&#42; serve as well as a front end to magic mockup mockups in
said repos &#42; [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) is our preferred design
tool of choice; it would be great if it had some GUI integration with
Magic Mockup, Sparkleshare, and Design Hub

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Ruby on Rails, web development, some UI design
chops *Skill level:* Intermediate *Contacts:* edirsh at redhat dot com

*Mentor(s):* [ Emily Dirsh](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Emichan)

*Notes:* We can provide a development platform for the web UI at
openshift.redhat.com. Also, note this project doesn't just benefit
Fedora designers, but it benefits all FLOSS designers.

#### Implement a unit test framework for fedpkg and rpkg

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Unit tests are good. Testing is good. fedpkg and it's
backend rpkg is a growing code base, gaining more and more contributors.
It lacks a unit test framework which would be very beneficial to the
code base for making sure contributions don't break the code in subtle
ways.

*Knowledge prerequisite:*

*Contacts:*

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* This project is in python.

#### Package GitLab in Fedora/EPEL

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* To package [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/) for Fedora
and EPEL (if possible).

Git has fundamentally improved the way that developers share code. The
barrier to sharing code has virtually been eliminated. We are also
seeing the emergence of a new dynamic called \'Social Coding\'. There's
no better example of this than Github.

Creating an environment to foster social coding, and a low barrier to
sharing code, requires more than just git, though. A lot of what makes
Github successful with git is the web-based front end.

Fortunately, there is an open source application named Gitlab that
provides much of the interactive functionality and usability that is
found at Github. The goal of this project is to bring that experience to
fedorahosted.org by setting up Gitlab.

This project will require working with ruby packaging sig to get the
necessary gems packaged and available in Fedora (and if possible EPEL as
well).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Ruby, git, packaging

*Skill level:* Medium

*Mentor(s):* Ranjib Dey (tentative), Dmitriy Zaporozhets (dzaporozhets),
Ariejan de Vroom (ariejan)

*Notes:* This idea is definitely something the Fedora project is
interested in pursuing. The work in this project will be carried on
after the project, and is an opportunity for a longer-term involvement
in Fedora.

A demo of Gitlab can be found here: <http://demo.gitlabhq.com>

#### Dorrie: A web-interface for building Fedora spins/remixes {#dorrie-a-web-interface-for-building-fedora-spinsremixes}

#### Financial IS for Fedora project

&#42; Status: Proposed &#42; Summary of idea: There is a need of an
information system where it can be used with in the project to track and
analyse the finacial activities. It may be a customiztion of a open
source solution or a solution from scratch. &#42; Skill Level: Medium

Notes: knowledge in PHP is required. MVC design pattern

#### Event management system for Fedora

&#42; Status: Proposed &#42; Summary of idea: Fedora contributors
organize lot of events. We need a system to manage them. This sounds
like a project management utility. You can either build from scratch or
customize an available free software. This can be used to small event
and as well as large event like FUDcons. The main advantage to use such
system is to organize tasks and manage the cost. If you are interested
contact me with a proposal. &#42; Skill Level: Medium &#42; Contacts:

#### Darkserver improvement

&#42; Status: Proposed

&#42; Summary of idea:
[Darkserver](http://darkserver.fedoraproject.org/) now only supports
primary koji instance of Fedora. We need support

other secondary architectures and distributions. Different workers
should use different job queues and they all should work independently.
The current admin commands also need proper upgrade to handle different
resources to import from. The code also needs to be rebased so that it
becomes more test friendly.

### Linux system services {#linux-system-services}

#### Implement a battery of unit tests for SSSD {#implement-a-battery-of-unit-tests-for-sssd}

&#42; Status: Proposed &#42; Summary of idea: The purpose of this
project is to develop a suite of unit tests for the SSSD. The unit tests
would leverage mock objects to be able to exercise code that is
otherwise only ever reachable when the SSSD is connected to the network.
Contributing the set of unit tests to the SSSD would greatly improve its
stability long-term and would help raise confidence when pushing new
SSSD versions into Fedora or other distributions. &#42; Knowledge

### Improving Fedora packaging {#improving-fedora-packaging}

#### AUR Clone for Fedora {#aur-clone-for-fedora}

*Status:* Proposed - Students\' Idea - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* The idea is to make an AUR clone for Fedora where
users can submit buildfiles, which need to be hosted. These set of files
can compile packages on the user side, and installed locally.

The benefit of this method is:

1.  No need to host the entire packages (saving space on servers hosting
    the RPMs)

2.  Make changes to the buildfile, and not compile the package

3.  Can pull sources from any version control system/stored tarballs to
    make a very upto-date package. (See blog entry for an example)

*Contacts:* [Anuj More](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anujmore)

*Notes:* Need mentor. Need advice on feasibility of the software and
issues that can arise. Also, read the extensive blog post on [my
blog](http://execat.blogspot.in/2012/03/aur-clone-for-fedora.html).

Analogy: This is a lot like \'having your own library\' vs \'getting a
book from a bookstore\'. If you refer a book often, you'd keep it in
your library. This would occupy space and consume resources. Otherwise,
you'd just pull out a separate paper with instructions about the
bookstore to find the book, and fetch the book from the store. Though
the first method is hassle-free, it is not possible to have all the
books in the world with you.

#### Maven FOSS Repository Extension {#maven-foss-repository-extension}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* With the inception of Maven we have a means to
standardize the building of Java projects. However it has also resulted
in the usage of a very wide dependency set by these Java projects. This
makes it very hard to integrate those projects on a single platform (be
it Fedora or JBoss Application Server (or the combination)).

In essence during packaging all these dependencies must be lined up to
form a single consistent component set. Thus each project will only have
those components available which are actually available on the target
platform. This is very hard to enforce using standard Maven setup.

For Fedora I'm envisioning a Maven extension that makes sure only
sanctioned components are used during the build (without putting a
burden on the packager). This will allow developers who are not on
Fedora to also build with this extension and thus verify (and fix)
issues which are the result of \'Fedora packaging\'.

A prototype can be viewed at [Maven FOSS Repository
Extension](https://github.com/fmvn/foss-maven).

### Fedora Spins and remixes {#fedora-spins-and-remixes}

#### Educational Application for Fedora Robotics Suite {#educational-application-for-fedora-robotics-suite}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Create an educational app introducing software from
Fedora Robotics Suite

The [Fedora Robotics SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Robotics)
is creating a [Robotics
Suite](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RoboticsSuite) consisting
of many packages useful in robotics. We want to develop a demonstration
application introducing new users step by step to core packages like
[Fawkes](http://www.fawkesrobotics.org) and
[Player/Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net). It would feature
multiple game-like levels with increasing complexity. The general task
would be to instruct the robot to fulfill a specific task in a
simulation environment.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Developing this requires a strong background
in C++, a background in robotics is preferred but not necessary. You
should be able to familiarize yourself with new software quickly. User
visible parts will require GUI programming using Gtkmm.

*Skill level:* Medium to High

### Applications for systems administrators {#applications-for-systems-administrators}

#### Improving the RHQ-PyAgent to interface with OpenLMI {#improving-the-rhq-pyagent-to-interface-with-openlmi}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Improve the current RHQ-PyAgent written in Python
that interfaces RHQ with OpenLMI to pick up metrics that are provided by
OpenLMI from Fedora or RHEL systems. The agent is talking to the RHQ
server via the REST api and push metrics to RHQ etc. This agent
does/will not implement the full functionality of the RHQ java agent.
The previous work is already pretty good, but it is cumbersome to add
new OpenLMI-enabled servers and the types of the data model. The work of
this year should concentrate on automating that process - perhaps after
providing a range of IP addresses to query for servers. Similar for
resource types, the agent would talk to the server to see what types are
available and then check with the OpenLMI provider if this supports the
same.

While RHQ is written in Java, this project does not require any Java
knowledge.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, Linux system administration,
principles of REST

### Applications for Testers {#applications-for-testers}

#### Fedora Gooey Karma {#fedora-gooey-karma}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* [Fedora Easy
Karma](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Easy_Karma) is a CLI
application to help testers apply karma to installed updates and while
it's great at doing so, it doesn't display much other information on
what an update is supposed to fix or what can be done to test a
particular update. A GUI tool that pulls in more information on packages
under test would help in the testing process and hopefully help
encourage less techical users to start testing packages.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* GUI tool kit (Qt or GTK), python

#### Blocker Tracking Application

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The [blockerbugs web
application](http://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs) is used by QA to
track bugs which are currently blocking release, proposed as blocking
release or could be pulled into the release past a code freeze. While
the app itself already exists, there are many features which we would
like to see implemented including (but not limited to):

&#42; Creating a RESTful API &#42; Tracking contents of TC/RC spins
&#42; migrating css to zurb foundation 4 &#42; search functionality
&#42; improve the update sync process &#42; implement CI tools (make-ish
file that runs pylint, tests etc.) &#42; integrate email (on error, on
proposal, other thoughts &#8230;) &#42; integrate fedbus (blocker X
proposed, accepted, rejected) &#42; fix the admin interface so that it
actually works

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Some python experience is required, the app is
written with Flask so some experiehce with that would be helpful

*Skill level:* Intermediate

#### Image Building Project

[The image building
project](https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-build-service/) started last
year as a gsoc project and while the progress was good, it isn't quite
to the point where we need it to be for everyday usage. The emphasis
would be on getting local image building to work before more work on
distributing image building tasks got started.

Possible project components:

&#42; side repository management &#42; better integration with bodhi and
working based on updates instead of just package envrs &#42; tree
replication &#42; integration with blockerbugs app &#42; deltaiso
creation &#42; zsync for downloads &#42; integration with koji's new
livecd scratch builds

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Some python experience is required,
familiarity with Fedora's ISO build tools would be preferred

*Skill level:* Intermediate to advanced

&#42;&#42; 2012 = Google Summer of Code 2012

![](Gsoc-2012-logo.png)

The Fedora project represented the Google Summer of Code program for 6
years and willing to participate on year 2012 program as well. This wiki
page serves as the GSoC portal. Please feel free to contact us via
[summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding)
for clarifications/ more info.

## Students {#students}

Students who are looking for challenges and would like to contribute to
the worlds\' leading and innovative Linux Distro, this could be the
chance. Please feel free to contact and refer to the material and start
contacting mentors.

1.  [Main Idea Page](ideas.xml)

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real world large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Create life time connections.

### Why work with Fedora? {#why-work-with-fedora}

Our project is large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various positions. This is just an example, as experience
and reputation in the Fedora Project communities is influential on your
career in many ways.

As long-standing communities with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being productively lost. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

### Step-by-step guide for students {#step-by-step-guide-for-students}

## Mentors {#mentors}

The contributors of the Fedora Project can propose ideas and mentor
them. Please feel free to check following links and please add your
ideas to the main idea page, further if you are not interested in
proposing an idea but still want to support the program please check the
students\' idea page and pick one as per your interest.

    page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2012/Students_Idea)

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

&#42; One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea
might be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level
of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

&#42; It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of
how an idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills
and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than
finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

&#42; Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case
you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

&#42; You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to
your sub-project. This requires a different level of communication
throughout the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
upstreams. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the
student is successful or not, which affects payment.

## Idea list for GSoC 2012

### Applications for desktop end users {#applications-for-desktop-end-users}

These are coding projects that benefit end users of the Linux desktop.

#### Integrate Proxy Settings and Network Connections(Locations) {#integrate-proxy-settings-and-network-connectionslocations}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The system should use an appropriate networking
profile (e.g. Proxy settings) for each network connection.

Gnome 2 had a concept of network locations in its Network Proxy
configuration window. However, user should selected the appropriate
location whenever he moves between networks. This idea is about
providing an integration between NetworkManager and Desktop environments
so that a user can create network profiles for each network
location(connection) providing appropriate settings like proxy settings
which is the main proposed setting here. NetworkManager can have a
\'Network Location\' concept: for wireless networks, usually the name of
the network (ESSID) is usually enough. For wired connections, DHCP
servers can and usually do provide network's domain name, which can be
used as the name of the location. It is nice if a user can associate
each network location with a network settings profile which will be used
whenever the user is connected to that network automatically. So, when
you connect to a network, a corresponding network settings profile is
activated automatically.

*Notes:* There is an entry with some description in [NetworkManager
TODO](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/TODO)
which should be considered for the implementation

#### Bringing the Cloud to the Fedora Desktop

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* [Aeolus](http://www.aeolusproject.org) is an umbrella
project that provides an open source API which to control any number of
backend proprietary cloud providers. It allows us to write tooling that
is able to deploy, monitor, and manager instances to any cloud provider
such as EC2 or OpenStack in a Free and Open Manner. We need more tooling
to interface with the various Aeolus components from the Fedora desktop
(or any other) in novel ways such as command-line and gtk-based
applications to deploy instances to the cheapest cloud provider or the
one with the fastest response time, to monitor running instances using
various visualizations, and more closely integrate local data and code
w/ that on the cloud.

*Knowledge prerequisite:*

*Skill level:*

*Contacts:* [Mo Morsi](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:_Mmorsi)

*Mentor(s):* [Mo Morsi](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:_Mmorsi), [
Matt Wagner](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:_Matthewwagner) as
co-mentor

*Notes:* Ping me (mmorsi on freenode) for more info about the Aeolus
project. All the components which to build images for the cloud and
control instances is in place and ready to go, just drop various bits
(they are interoperable and interchangable) into an environment to be
able to interact with the cloud, avoiding proprietary interfaces and
vendor lockin.

#### Web hosting control panel {#web-hosting-control-panel}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* develop a free alternative of cpanel / plesk control
panels, 100% compatible with fedora, and redhat enterprise Linux.
written in python.

the control panel will be able to create domains and automatically setup
apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, postgresql bind etc&#8230;

*Knowledge prerequisite:* apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, postgresql,
proftpd, bind

#### Assemble a toolchain for recording screencasts easily {#assemble-a-toolchain-for-recording-screencasts-easily}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* Creating screencasts on Fedora and post-processing
them for upload should be easy and fool proof.

The [Fedora Videos](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Videos) project has
been launched to bring together a collection of screencasts that help
people learn how to use Fedora. There's only one major hurdle, though.
Capturing really good screencasts on Fedora, post-processing them to
include an intro and outro and other effects, and finally exporting them
to an open format is challenging. There are lots of different tools, but
each one only gets you part of the way there and you have to be the glue
to make it all work. And then there are the bugs.

The goal of this project is to assemble a toolchain (a recommended
collection of software available in the Fedora repositories) and write a
comprehensive tutorial for how to create an professional-looking
screencast. That may included chasing down &amp; fixing bugs in the
existing tools, discovering new tools and getting them packaged and
learning about techniques in the environment around the computer, such
as how to select &amp; setup a microphone or how to draft a good
speaking script. One possible task in the project is to add sound
recording support to the Gnome 3 desktop recorder. Currently, the
desktop recorder only grabs the video of the screen.

The student will get support and advice from the Fedora Videos team
since they are trying to learn how to create these screencasts.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* gstreamer, video and sound editing, blender

*Skill level:* Medium

#### Improve Fedora's Tablet User Experience {#improve-fedoras-tablet-user-experience}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Improving Fedora's Tablet User Experience.

The window managers/desktop environments officially supported by Fedora
do not match the expectations of people with low power touch devices.

Fedora features new technology to reduce system load and - requirements,
the user interface has not seen too much love.

Currently available interfaces for users are:

&#42; Too Ressource Consuming &#42; Too Overloaded or &#42; Too Feature
Poor &#42; Not Customizable With Reasonable Effort

The E17 Desktop Shell, developed as part of the [Enlightenment
Project](http://www.enlightenment.org), is a perfect match. It provides
a rich interface, whilst consuming very little ressources. The
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, on which E17 is built upon, were
chosen as Foundation Block of Tizen, the MeeGo successor backed by
Samsung and Intel. If things work out, E17 will be the first \'real\'
Desktop Shell for Wayland.

Though it already provides [special
behaviour](http://dev.enlightenment.fr/~captainigloo/2011/08/25/elfe-and-the-composited-windows-list/)
for touchscreen devices through certain modules, there's still room for
improvement.

The overall goal of this project would be to improve the user experience
of people who want to use Fedora on low power devices such as tablets.

The student will get support and advice from the Enlightenment Project
developers.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, X11, Wayland, Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries

*Skill level:* Medium to High

*Contacts:* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so), [ Leif
Middelschulte](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:leif) (leif \[dot\]
middelschulte \[at\] student \[dot\] kit \[dot\] edu)

*Mentor(s):* Michael Bouchaud (yoz \[at\] efl \[dot\] so)

*Notes:* If this idea gets realized, a proper tablet spin can be
created, that honors the spirit of Fedora.

### Applications for programmers {#applications-for-programmers}

#### Implement a binding translator for GlusterFS {#implement-a-binding-translator-for-glusterfs}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In transporting data across networks, programmers
need GlusterFS language bindings to be able to create apps in their
language of choice. A language binding translator would greatly increase
the number of programmers who would be able to more easily extend
GlusterFS. It's also a fun project for someone wanting to get some
experience with multi-threaded architecture and design in the context of
distributed systems and data.

#### Implement a Cassandra/NoSQL Connector or Translator for GlusterFS {#implement-a-cassandranosql-connector-or-translator-for-glusterfs}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* In general, there is a need for the ability to store
and access NoSQL data on general purpose distributed filesystems.
Currently, there are a host of single-purpose methods for storing and
retrieving NoSQL data, which are difficult to access from legacy
applications. Creating a NoSQL translator for GlusterFS would help
mitigate this problem and give developers more options for storing and
accessing \'big data\' in a way that is accessible via a variety of
standard toolkits and protocols.

### Linux kernel project {#linux-kernel-project}

#### Implement nfs/fscache writeback cache

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Currently, the flashcache/bcache only works for local
filesystems. For network filesystems, nfs only supports write through
cache based on fscache/cachefiles. With wider adoption of SSD on nfs
client side, it would be great for nfs to support writeback cache to
speed up write intensive clients. This project would implement a
writeback mechanism for nfs, which need to make necessary changes to
kernel nfs, fscache and cachefiles modules, and take care of nfs
close-to-open semantics.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* C, Linux kernel, nfs

### Infrastructure for Fedora contributors and users {#infrastructure-for-fedora-contributors-and-users}

#### Implement a survey infrastructure for the Fedora Project

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Surveys are important to increase the quality of a
service, and it is true for the Fedora project as well.(discussions
[1](http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/2011-12-24/apac.2011-12-24-04.00.log.html&#35;l-310))
In this project it is supposed to implement a survey infrastructure
facility so that the contributors can use for various activities as per
the need.

The concern is to develop a simple web base survey system OR implement a
existing survey project and customized as required, so that contributors
can easily create surveys and dig for results as well. Linking with the
\[FAS\|FAS\] is required. Further it should be compatible with anonymous
and open ID so that if the creator set for those authentication the
survey should allow those authentications. Statistics and other required
reports can be obtained. So that it is easy to analyse.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* PHP, Python, Ruby are preferred, MySQL
(database handling), experience with Lime Survey would be an advantage

#### Design Hub: FLOSS Collaboration for FLOSS Designers {#design-hub-floss-collaboration-for-floss-designers}

*Status:* Proposed - Draft

*Summary of idea:* Free software designers don't have a great set of
tools to work with to collaborate with each other and with the community
on their design work. With this project, we'd like to make progress
towards fixing that. We have some disparate ideas / tools that we'd like
to be integrated:

&#42; [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org) - a git-backed, Dropbox
like system that will automatically check in and push files in project
directly to a shared git repo &#42; [Magic
Mockup](https://github.com/garrett/magicmockup) - a
coffeescript/javascript you can insert into an SVG of mockups to enable
interactive, click-through mockups ([see a demo
here](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/2011/08/12/interactive-svg-mockups-with-inkscape-javascript/)
&#42; [Design Hub](http://blog.linuxgrrl.com/category/design-hub/) - an
idea and a ruby on rails prototype of a web front end that could
potentially serve as a front end to git repos with design assets
&#42;and&#42; serve as well as a front end to magic mockup mockups in
said repos &#42; [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) is our preferred design
tool of choice; it would be great if it had some GUI integration with
Magic Mockup, Sparkleshare, and Design Hub

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Ruby on Rails, web development, some UI design
chops

*Notes:* We can provide a development platform for the web UI at
openshift.redhat.com. Also, note this project doesn't just benefit
Fedora designers, but it benefits all FLOSS designers.

#### Implement a unit test framework for fedpkg and rpkg {#implement-a-unit-test-framework-for-fedpkg-and-rpkg}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Unit tests are good. Testing is good. fedpkg and it's
backend rpkg is a growing code base, gaining more and more contributors.
It lacks a unit test framework which would be very beneficial to the
code base for making sure contributions don't break the code in subtle
ways.

#### isitfedoraruby.com

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Right now most Ruby programmers make use of the
[gem](http://rubygems.org/) package management system to install Ruby
libraries on their system. The
[Fedora/Ruby](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ruby_SIG) community works
hard to convert these gems into rpms for inclusion in the Fedora stack,
making use of various tooling such as
[gem2rpm](https://github.com/lutter/gem2rpm). We are looking for more
tools and capabilities around Ruby / Fedora integration, namely to
reduce the overhead in supporting Ruby on Fedora and to promote Fedora
as the de-facto platform for Ruby development.

As part of this, we would like to develop a isitfedoraruby.com website
(similar to [isitruby19](http://isitruby19.com/) and other sites like
it) to promote the ruby stack on Fedora and the Fedora/Ruby development
effort, highlighting success stories, use cases, ways contributors can
help, etc

#### Setup Gitlab as a front end for Fedora Hosted git repositories

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* To setup [Gitlab](http://gitlabhq.com/) as a front
end for git repositories at \[fedorahosted.org\].

Git has fundamentally improved the way that developers share code. The
barrier to sharing code has virtually been eliminated. We are also
seeing the emergence of a new dynamic called \'Social Coding\'. There's
no better example of this than Github.

Creating an environment to foster social coding, and a low barrier to
sharing code, requires more than just git, though. A lot of what makes
Github successful with git is the web-based front end. That explains why
there is such a dramatic difference between Github and fedorahosted.org,
and why many projects are moving to Github instead.

Fortunately, there is an open source application named Gitlab that
provides much of the interactive functionality and usability that is
found at Github. The goal of this project is to bring that experience to
fedorahosted.org by setting up Gitlab.

This project will require working with the infrastructure team to get
the necessary prerequisites installed, find a server to host the
application and configure the existing projects to be wired to this
interface.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Ruby, git, Linux system administration (web
servers, authentication)

*Skill level:* Medium

Zaporozhets (dzaporozhets), Ariejan de Vroom (ariejan)

*Notes:* This idea is definitely something the Fedora project is
interested in pursuing. The work in this project will be carried on
after the project, and is an opportunity for a longer-term involvement
in Fedora.

See the discussion on the Fedora Infrastructure list about
implementation details:

## Linux system services {#linux-system-services}

### Improving Fedora packaging {#improving-fedora-packaging}

#### Java API/ABI changes checker

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Libraries written in Java add, remove and modify
their public interfaces from time to time. This is normal, but currently
it is very hard to guess effect an update of library to new version will
have on rest of the system. What is needed is a tool that would be able
to tell us that \'With update of package java-library to version 2.0,
function X(b) has been removed. This function is used in package
java-app\'. There are already a few open-source projects that can do
some of the analysis needed. This would be of interest to whole Java
world I believe and would enable safer and easier updates. To get an
idea of similar projects see [Java API compliance
checker](http://linuxtesting.org/upstream-tracker/java/) and [Python
Javaclass
project](https://sites.google.com/site/obriencj/projects/java-classfile-python-module)

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Knowledge of Java (inheritance rules,
generics, etc.) and probably some scripting language(s)

*Skill level:* Fairly high

#### AUR Clone for Fedora {#aur-clone-for-fedora}

*Status:* Proposed - Students\' Idea - Need a mentor

*Summary of idea:* The idea is to make an AUR clone for Fedora where
users can submit buildfiles, which need to be hosted. These set of files
can compile packages on the user side, and installed locally.

The benefit of this method is:

1.  No need to host the entire packages (saving space on servers hosting
    the RPMs)

2.  Make changes to the buildfile, and not compile the package

3.  Can pull sources from any version control system/stored tarballs to
    make a very upto-date package. (See blog entry for an example)

*Contacts:* [Anuj More](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anujmore)

*Notes:* Need mentor. Need advice on feasibility of the software and
issues that can arise. Also, read the extensive blog post on [my
blog](http://execat.blogspot.in/2012/03/aur-clone-for-fedora.html).

Analogy: This is a lot like \'having your own library\' vs \'getting a
book from a bookstore\'. If you refer a book often, you'd keep it in
your library. This would occupy space and consume resources. Otherwise,
you'd just pull out a separate paper with instructions about the
bookstore to find the book, and fetch the book from the store. Though
the first method is hassle-free, it is not possible to have all the
books in the world with you.

#### Maven FOSS Repository Extension {#maven-foss-repository-extension}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* With the inception of Maven we have a means to
standardize the building of Java projects. However it has also resulted
in the usage of a very wide dependency set by these Java projects. This
makes it very hard to integrate those projects on a single platform (be
it Fedora or JBoss Application Server (or the combination)).

In essence during packaging all these dependencies must be lined up to
form a single consistent component set. Thus each project will only have
those components available which are actually available on the target
platform. This is very hard to enforce using standard Maven setup.

For Fedora I'm envisioning a Maven extension that makes sure only
sanctioned components are used during the build (without putting a
burden on the packager). This will allow developers who are not on
Fedora to also build with this extension and thus verify (and fix)
issues which are the result of \'Fedora packaging\'.

A prototype can be viewed at [Fedora Maven
Extension](https://github.com/wolfc/fedora-maven).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Knowledge of Maven

*Skill level:* Medium

### Fedora Spins and remixes {#fedora-spins-and-remixes}

#### Fedora Audio Creation Spin

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* To create a Fedora Audio spin showcasing the rich and
diverse landscape of Linux Audio production.

The [Fedora Audio Creation
SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Audio_Creation) is a collection of
enthusiastic Fedora users driven by the common desire to make the best
Linux distribution also the best for Music creation and Audio
Production.

We are looking for one or two candidates to assist us in the complete
development cycle of this project. Tasks may include (but not limited
to):

&#42; packaging open source audio projects &#42; porting certain
packages from the PlanetCCRMA repository into Fedora &#42;
working/communicating with the Fedora Audio community to determine the
final make-up of the spin &#42; help coordinate pushing the spin through
the Spins Review process &#42; creating/testing kickstart files &#42;
developing small applications/scripts to help solve hardware and audio
system configuration requirements &#42; communicating with Fedora Audio
SIG, Fedora Desktop team and other Fedora teams &#42; organizing QA
testcases and test days

Ideally, interested candidates will have a passion for Music/Audio
Production. Basic scripting knowledge and the ability to compile
projects from source is a must. Sponsored packagers / knowledge of the
Fedora Packaging Guidelines and/or the desire to continuing maintaining
the packaged software post-project considered a plus.

Interested? Why wait, submit an audio package for review and get
sponsored (Join_the_package_collection_maintainers).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Scripting/programming (bash/python)

*Skill level:* Rudimentry

Jones](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:bsjones) and [Christopher
Antila](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Crantila)

#### Fedora JBoss Spin

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* To create a Fedora JBoss spin that helps Java
developers get started quickly using JBoss software.

The [Java SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Java) and the [JBoss
AS 7 on Fedora Initiative](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JBossAS7) is a
cross-section of enthusiastic Fedora users driven by the common desire
to make the Fedora the best OS for developing with JBoss software.

We are looking for one or two candidates to assist us in the complete
development cycle of this project. The bulk of the effort lies in
packaging open source Java and JBoss projects and integrating many of
the packages from the JBoss Community into Fedora. Packages in
particular include JBoss AS 7, JBoss Tools and JBoss Forge. Other tasks
may include the testing of kickstart files and developing configurations
to better integrate with the Fedora Desktop.

There could be two variants of this spin (feel free to choose). One is
on the developer needing a good desktop to create JBoss-based
applications (things like Eclipse + JBoss Tools, AS 7, Forge, a
database, and so on). The other focus is on getting a server setup so
that it can run the application. That would also be where the upcoming
OpenShift toolset will come into play.

Another critical component is the interoperability with Eclipse. It's
important that a setup for Eclipse gets augmented for a developer to
install/implement the JBoss specific tools and plugins. A decision needs
to be done, whether updates of Eclipse should be done via RPMs or via a
Eclipse repository. JBossAS7 is targeting a maven repository setup - one
option could simply be to tie into this repository.

Ideally, interested candidates will have a passion for Java development
using JBoss software. Basic scripting knowledge and the ability to
compile Java projects from source is a must. Sponsored packagers /
knowledge of the Fedora Packaging Guidelines and/or the desire to
continuing maintaining the packaged software post-project considered a
plus, but not required.

Interested? Why wait, submit a Java package for review and get sponsored
([Join the package collection
maintainers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers)).

#### Educational Application for Fedora Robotics Suite {#educational-application-for-fedora-robotics-suite}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Create an educational app introducing software from
Fedora Robotics Suite

The [Fedora Robotics SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Robotics)
is creating a [Robotics
Suite](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RoboticsSuite) consisting
of many packages useful in robotics. We want to develop a demonstration
application introducing new users step by step to core packages like
[Fawkes](http://www.fawkesrobotics.org) and
[Player/Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net). It would feature
multiple game-like levels with increasing complexity. The general task
would be to instruct the robot to fulfill a specific task in a
simulation environment.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Developing this requires a strong background
in C++, a background in robotics is preferred but not necessary. You
should be able to familiarize yourself with new software quickly. User
visible parts will require GUI programming using Gtkmm.

### Applications for systems administrators {#applications-for-systems-administrators}

#### RHQ-agent to interface with Matahari

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Write a RHQ-agent in Python and make it interface
with Matahari to pick up metrics that are provided by Matahari from
Fedora or RHEL systems. The agent would talk to the RHQ server via the
REST api and push metrics to RHQ etc. This agent will not implement the
full functionality of the RHQ java agent.

While RHQ is written in Java, this project does not need any Java
knowledge.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, Linux system administration, qpid,
principles of REST

*Skill level:* Medium to High

*Notes:* RHQ wiki is at <http://rhq-project.org/>

### Applications for Testers {#applications-for-testers}

#### Fedora Gooey Karma {#fedora-gooey-karma}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* [Fedora Easy
Karma](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Easy_Karma) is a CLI
application to help testers apply karma to installed updates and while
it's great at doing so, it doesn't display much other information on
what an update is supposed to fix or what can be done to test a
particular update. A GUI tool that pulls in more information on packages
under test would help in the testing process and hopefully help
encourage less techical users to start testing packages.

*Knowledge prerequisite:* GUI tool kit (Qt or GTK), python

*Skill level:* intermediate

*Contacts:* [Tim Flink
(tflink)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tflink)

#### Fedora On-Demand Build Service

*Status:* Proposed (Student Idea)

*Summary of idea:* During the testing of Fedora releases, test images
are often useful as smoke tests before full TC/RC composes, as baselines
for specific test days or for automated installation testing in AutoQA.
The idea is to make an &#42;on-demand&#42; Web-based build service
(similar to [Open Suse Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and
[Slax](http://www.slax.org/build.php)) which users/developers can use to
make custom Fedora based distributions. The service would be capable of
building and hosting images (boot iso, installation DVDs and live
images) made up of builds from stable repositories in addition to side
repos containing specific builds from both updates-testing and koji
builds that have yet to be pushed to any repos. The service should also
also have a RESTful API (or similar).

*Knowledge prerequisite:* Python, Fedora repositories

*Knowledge nice-to-have*: Fedora image building, testing, Celery

*Skill level:* intermediate to advanced

## Applications for desktop end users {#applications-for-desktop-end-users}

These are coding projects that benefit end users of the Linux desktop.

### Wubi like application for Fedora

*Status:*

*Summary of idea:* <https://launchpad.net/wubi> is a great tool that
lets one install Linux from a windows OS. It would be nice to have
something like this for Fedora as well.

### Integrate Proxy Settings and Network Locations

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* The system should use an appropriate networking
profile (e.g. Proxy settings) for each network location.

Currently, Gnome does have a concept of network locations in its Network
Proxy configuration window. However, user should select the appropriate
location whenever he moves between networks. This idea is about
providing an integration between NetworkManager and Desktop environments
so that a user can create network profiles for each network location
providing appropriate settings like proxy settings which is the main
proposed setting here. NetworkManager can have a \'Network Location\'
concept: for wireless networks, usually the name of the network (ESSID)
is usually enough. For wired connections, DHCP servers can and usually
do provide network's domain name, which can be used as the name of the
location. It is nice if a user can associate each network location with
a network settings profile which will be used whenever the user is
connected to that network automatically. So, when you connect to a
network, a corresponding network settings profile is activated
automatically.

### Fill in some of the Missing nVidia and Radeon API pieces

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Add some of the missing 3d APIs for at least one of
the major card types, considerably helping out the beleagured Radeon and
Nvidia reverse-engineering efforts. There is enough currently (F14)
missing that most 3d games do not function correctly, many of the
underpinnings of FireFox 4 acceleration are blacklisted under Linux, and
many other visual and other components cannot make correct use of the
gpu(s) under Linux. Progress is abysmal for many reasons.

*Contacts:*

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* Requires good integration with the existing Radeon and nVidia
teams and their testsuites

### SPICE as a replacement for VNC and LTSP

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* SPICE is a virtual desktop interaction protocol that
would be an ideal replacement for VNC and current X based LTSP
implementations. Using SPICE would improve the user experience by
implementing some missing capabilities such as sound in VNC, and making
LTSP more efficient than using raw X. A common protocol for all types of
remote displays would also simplify the client setup. More information
on SPICE can be found here:

<http://www.spicespace.org/>

## Applications for programmers {#applications-for-programmers}

Other programmers benefit most from these coding project ideas.

### Better Erlang support

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* There is one major issue with Erlang RPM packaging
now. A dependencies between Erlang packages still must be calculated by
hand. There was an initial attempt to create list of Provides and
Requires automatically during build stage but it wasn't finished.
Another interesting task is to tightly integrate Erlang/OTP essential
feature of live application upgrades with RPM upgrade process thus
allowing really smooth upgrades of running Erlang applications.

*Contacts:* [Peter Lemenkov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Peter)

*Mentor(s):* [Peter Lemenkov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Peter)

*Notes:* Requires average knowledge of RPM building process and
installation procedure. Also basic Erlang knowledge is required.

## Infrastructure for Fedora contributors and users {#infrastructure-for-fedora-contributors-and-users}

Other contributors and users of the Fedora Project's infrastructure
benefit most from these coding projects.

### Port Infrastructure TurboGears apps to TG2

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Several Fedora Infrastructure applications are
written in TurboGears 1.0, and for longevity need to be ported to TG2.
These include bodhi, mirrormanager, packagedb, elections, fas, smolt.

*Contacts:* [Matt Domsch](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mdomsch),
[Toshio Kuratomi](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:toshio)

*Mentor(s):* [mdomsch](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mdomsch)

### MirrorManager enhancements

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* MirrorManager provides the mirror lists to all Fedora
systems. In addition to porting to TG2 (see above), several enhancements
would be welcome:

&#42; Simplify creation of new MirrorManager instances (non-Fedora
users, such as CentOS) &#42; Simplify selection of mirrors within Cloud
Providers on granularity other than netblocks and ASNs &#42; Other items
on the [TODO
list](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/mirrormanager?p=mirrormanager;a=blob;f=TODO;hb=HEAD)

*Contacts:* [Matt Domsch](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mdomsch)

*Mentor(s):* [mdomsch](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:mdomsch)

### Create a Fedora Events System

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* The idea is to create a website which would allow
displaying events, divided by region, list attendance, topics discussed
and other points. For reference, see [Ubuntu Loco
Events](http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/).

[Roadmap](http://nushio.fedorapeople.org/fes/roadmap.html) (Work in
progress. Tasks are defined, but dates aren't yet)

*Contacts:*

*Mentor(s):* [Nushio](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Nushio)
develops webapps as a dayjob and wouldn't mind making it a summer job
too.

*Notes:* [giallu](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giallu) the Ubuntu
site is a django application, code available as GPLv3
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~loco-directory-dev/loco-directory> If they
do not require copyright assignment I'd consider using it

### Self Manage Buildroot overrides

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* when users need a buildroot override they can manage
it all themselves.

For this I see 2 parts: cli integration into fedpkg i.e. \'fedpkg
override\' and a server to talk to, track overrides, and do the actual
tagging and untagging -possible work flow: allow developer to specify a
life for the override, defaulting to 24 hours: the server would then do
the tag in koji and at the end of its life untag it I could see having a
web app to see the current overrides, allow requests, extensions etc

*Mentor(s):* [Dennis Gilmore](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ausil)

### &#96;mw&#96; enhancements {#mw-enhancements}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* mw is a command-line program that pretends to be a
version control system. It should eventually help people who are console
nuts (like me) edit MediaWiki-based wikis without having to shout at
their web browser.

*Contacts:* [Ian Weller](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ianweller)

*Mentor(s):* [Ian Weller](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ianweller)

*Notes:* Here are some ideas for students: [User:Ianweller/mw
thoughts](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ianweller/mw_thoughts)

### Complete implementation and deployment of Copr

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Finalize and deploy the personal repositories concept
initiated by <http://repos.fedorapeople.org>

[Copr (Cool Other Package
Repo)](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Copr) is a Fedora project
to help make building and managing third party package repositories
easy. The instance to be installed within Fedora Infrastructure provides
Fedora maintainers with the ability to create repos of packages to build
against and share with others.

As a Fedora user and Ambassador, I'm asked a lot about this feature in
Fedora.

*Contacts:*

### Integrating Fuzzing-based instruments in quality assurance tools

*Summary of idea:* Generate fuzzing testcases from the existing \'make
test\', which is generally only as good as the package maintainer placed
effort into this Extending the range of testcases in a generic way
contributes to an enhanced scope of quality and security testing of
software. Key implementation technique is providing mock \'fuzzing\'
devices and transparent in-process instrumentation (fuzzing loops) the
turn-around time and bug discovery rate will improve. Transparent
integration in build tools (like rpm-build macros) lower the entry
hurdle for developers and maintainers.

Key components:

-Fuzzing devices: By this we mean user space devices that manipulate
given original data based on a given fuzzing strategy, the strategy
chosen depends on the nature of the file type, implemented by plugins
(for a start provide comprehensive plugin source for image types, gif
png, multimedia, midi).

-Package QA process: We think that a prototypical integration in
rpm-build (macro, pre-waive certain results ) will help (Fedora)
developers package maintainers to transparently gain from these
functionality during package build.

Target: It is expected that all posix variants can benefit from wrapping
fuzzing algorithms behind devices, however due to the rpm-build macro
support, we expect most benefit for rpm-based distros.

## Linux system services {#linux-system-services}

These coding projects are lower-level services that benefit Fedora and
other Linux distributions.

### &#96;NIS&#96; support in &#96;SSSD&#96; {#nis-support-in-sssd}

&#42; *Status:* Proposed &#42; *Summary of idea:* Currently, the System
Security Services Daemon supports only LDAP for network user identity.
Support for NIS identities has been requested several times by
end-users. &#42; *Contacts:* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh) &#42;
*Mentor(s):* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh)

### &#96;SUDO&#96; support in &#96;SSSD&#96; {#sudo-support-in-sssd}

&#42; *Status:* Proposed &#42; *Summary of idea:* Sudo 1.8.0 will
support a plugin interface for sudo authorization decisions. It would be
excellent for SSSD to provide such a plugin to provide cached access to
sudo information stored in the sudo LDAP schema. This would make it
easier to maintain centralized sudo rules that also function while
offline. &#42; *Contacts:* [Stephen
Gallagher](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh) &#42;

## Improving Fedora packaging {#improving-fedora-packaging}

The heart of Fedora are the packages and the applications that manage
them; these coding projects help improve the package experience for
users and contributors.

### Maven and PackageKit integration

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Currently when building with maven locally, all spec
files need to specify build dependencies manually. Java libraries and
maven plugins should have something like
\'Provide(groupId:artifactId:version:format)\' so that \'yum install
org.apache.velocity:velocity\' will correctly find and install velocity
package. Second part of this project can be creating maven plugin asking
you to install via PackageKit the package that provides the dependency.

*Contacts:* [Stanislav
Ochotnicky](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sochotni) or [Alexander
Kurtakov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Akurtakov)

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* Basic knowledge of maven and rpm is required.

### KDE Plasma and PackageKit integration

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Add automatically-generated rpm dependencies for
kde/plasma related services (see also [blog entry on the
topic](http://rdieter.livejournal.com/14897.html)), and add packagekit
hooks to use them (one concrete example would be for plasma dataengines
(see also [blog entry on the
topic](http://rdieter.livejournal.com/14897.html)).

*Contacts:* [Rex Dieter](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rdieter)

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* Intermediate knowledge of rpm and/or kde plasma coding

### Avahi yum repositories

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Add a yum plugin that will use avahi to find local
mirrors of canonical repositories, and tools/scripts for local http/nfs
servers to advertise what they have. It would also be nice to include
proper nfs repository support in yum or a plugin, so the advertised
repositories can be on NFS filesystems that are not already mounted
locally on clients. The use on the clients should be transparent without
any local yum repo config changes except perhaps for installing/enabling
the plugin. Later anaconda could also be taught to use avahi to find
repositories for installation.

*Contacts:* [Roland McGrath](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:roland)

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* Divisible into various separate pieces that are worthwhile on
their own.

### Improve critical dependency management in Yum

*Status:* Proposed (please review)

*Summary of idea:* The idea (roughly) is that Yum could detect when a
package update is going to break some important functionality of the
system because is a dependency of another package that won't be updated
(for example: Yum is not detecting that when a kernel is updated,
because the previous kernel is not deleted, and the dependency isn't
broken). This happens once in a while with kernel and third party
packages that provide support for devices that aren't supported by
Fedora directly because of licensing restrictions: ie. Fedora updates
the kernel, and RPM Fusion packages related to Broadcom wireless usually
need 2-4 days to be updated, resulting in a non working wireless.

*Contacts:*

*Mentor(s):*

*Notes:* I don't feel qualified to be mentor.

### Masking packages

Mixing stable and unstable packages (ie from different repositories) is
quite tiresome and hardly manageable for more than a few packets. What
is missing is something like the Gentoo approach where you can unmask
(or mask) certain unstable packages so that they will be pulled and
installed into your otherwise stable-only environment. The user has to
resolve any conflicts that may arise.

Apart from the luxury of more bleeding-edge packages available, this
could also really get more people into testing of unstable packages.
With changed policies regarding only stable updates / backports to a
stable Fedora release, this would make Fedora still attractive for users
that like to work with latest packages but refrain from rawhide for
whatever reasons.

### Smarter Yum Metadata

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Share yum metadata among users of a system and also
fetch them faster instead of downloading the whole chunk each time.

A git-based metadata store was
[proposed](http://log.amitshah.net/2010/12/idea-faster-metadata-downloads-with-yum.html)
but [objected](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664356) to by
yum maintainers. There could be other ways of doing this, as suggested
in the bug report or by going ahead with the git idea --- I believe it
can be done.

*Contacts:*

### Turn smock into a real program

*Status:*

*Summary of idea:*
[smock](http://git.annexia.org/?p=fedora-mingw.git;a=tree;f=smock;hb=HEAD)
is a hack that Dan and I wrote a few years ago that lets you build a
chain of RPMs in mock. It works out all the dependencies and builds the
packages in the right order, using the result from an earlier build to
satisfy dependencies in a later build, and being almost completely
automated. What really needs to happen is that
[mock](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock) is extended to
support this as a native feature.

## Fedora Spins and remixes {#fedora-spins-and-remixes}

Remixing and making new Fedora Spins is an important part of the
community's freedoms, and these coding projects support that.

### Fedora Medical

*Status:* In progress.

*Summary of idea:* Here, we are looking for a couple students who have
some experience in RPM packaging, python, and bash. This would be a good
opportunity to learn in depth packaging and fedora contributor
ecosystem.

This is a work in progress and details can be found here:
<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/FedoraMedical>

We are looking forward to do mainly packaging and getting them published
to fedora repo. However, we will also be doing some tooling and
associated works. So, python and bash will be required.

Understanding fedora package maintainer guideline is required. Having
existing packages in fedora will be a plus. Also, the student should be
interested in maintaining some of those packages after SOC.

### Create a spin to aid students in education and to help them understand Linux and Fedora better

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* The idea is to create a spin which would be more
student friendly. It should have some graph plotting tools, some circuit
simulator, maybe an equation solving application, IDE for some basic
coding and a few compilers which are taught in colleges and other
relevant stuff. It should consist of extensive documentation to help
students use these tools and Linux in general. A few interesting games
and music player would be a plus.

Additionally, if possible, one can imagine to throw up a screen during
install which would help in picking the age group of the student. The
applications can be installed accordingly. For example, I would like to
have a scrabble game for a small kid then a circuit simulator.

### Educational Application for Fedora Robotics Suite {#educational-application-for-fedora-robotics-suite}

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Create an educational app introducing software from
Fedora Robotics Suite

The [Fedora Robotics SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Robotics)
is creating a [Robotics
Suite](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RoboticsSuite) consisting
of many packages useful in robotics. We want to develop a demonstration
application introducing new users step by step to core packages like
[Fawkes](http://www.fawkesrobotics.org) and
[Player/Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net). It would feature
multiple game-like levels with increasing complexity. The general task
would be to instruct the robot to fulfill a specific task in a
simulation environment.

Developing this requires a strong background in C++, a background in
robotics is preferred but not necessary. You should be able to
familiarize yourself with new software quickly. User visible parts will
require GUI programming using Gtkmm.

### Dorrie - A Web interface to create Fedora Remixes

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of Idea:* Contribute to Dorrie, and make it more usable, tested
and deployable.

More at [Dorrie](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remixes_Web_Interface),
code at <https://github.com/shreyankg/Dorrie>, fork and send pull

&#42;&#42; 2010 = Google Summer of Code 2010

The Fedora Summer Coding program connects students, mentors,
sub-projects, and sponsors to provide coding opportunities as summer
jobs.

This page has information for all the groups involved. ([Short
URL.](http://bit.ly/FSC-2010))

*TOC*

## General information

The [Summer Coding 2010 schedule](schedule.xml) has the timeline of
events.

The page [Summer Coding 2010](#index) is the central location to find
information about the program.

## You are a student

This section is for students interested in contributing to the Fedora
Project or JBoss.org through Fedora Summer Coding 2010.

If you have an idea or want to participate through Fedora or JBoss.org,
you should already be looking around the community and
[communicating](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help).

### Timeline for students

### Step-by-step for students

### Why spend your summer working on FOSS? {#why-spend-your-summer-working-on-foss}

When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
bottom of the bit drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance
to contribute to a living project.

Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

&#42; Work with real world large codebases. &#42; Collaborate with real
engineers and other professional experts. &#42; Contribute to something
meaningful while learning and earning student value. &#42; Learn tools
and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work
in technology after graduation. &#42; Make friends and contacts around
the globe. &#42; Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship
or job after graduation. &#42; Earn while you learn. We are planning to
sponsor \$5000 for full projects and \$2500 for half projects. Check out
Summer_Coding_FAQ for more details.

### Why work with Fedora and JBoss.org?

Our projects are large and diverse. We are very experienced at working
with new contributors and helping them be successful.

Many long-time contributors continue to be around, lending expertise and
mentoring. People who stay around the community and do good work are
noticed. They get hired for jobs from it, including being hired by Red
Hat. [Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat, as well
as interns in various
positions](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSoC_report_2009). This is
just an example, as experience and reputation in the JBoss.org and
Fedora Project communities is influential on your career in many ways.

As long-standing communities with many facets, it is possible for you to
find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

You should know that contributing to FOSS doesn't require you to have
super programming skills, or super-anything else. You just need be
interested and curious enough, and be willing to become comfortable
being *productively lost*. This is the state of learning through finding
your way around and figuring things out.

### Do you want to start from ideas mentors already have?

Mentors and sub-projects have put up sections on the [Summer Coding 2010
ideas](ideas.xml) page. There you can find:

&#42; Full ideas that you might want to start on; &#42; Suggestions and
use cases, to help you make up your own idea; &#42; Links to the
sub-project/upstream where you can learn more.

For example, if you are interested in doing something for the [RHQ
Project](http://rhq-project.org), there is a link to an ideas page on
their website and how to contact the team. If you contact them, you can
learn about even more ideas, and share some of your thinking.

Even if a mentor has an idea, you want to find one that inspires you.
You must become part of the idea yourself.

### Do you have an idea you need a mentor for?

People can be most passionate about an idea that is their own. That
passion can be what helps you get through the hard part of the project.

Do you know what person or sub-project in JBoss or Fedora that might be
the mentoring group for your idea?

You need to do these things:

1.  Contact the relevant sub-project for your idea or contact [the
    discussion
    group](http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding-discuss).

2.  Be prepared to explain your idea, receive input and criticism, and
    grow (or reduce) the idea so it has the best chance of being
    accepted for Fedora Summer Coding.

3.  Create an idea page, noting in the section for mentors that you are
    looking for a mentor. Use [How to create an idea page for Summer
    Coding](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_idea_page_for_Summer_Coding)
    to make the page.

### Are you already working in the Fedora or JBoss communities?

Students who are users, participants, or contributors in the Fedora and
JBoss communities are *encouraged* to participate.

Do you have ideas for what you'd like to see in the project?

Are you working in an area of the project that might want to mentor you
for your Summer Coding 2010 work? For example, if you write for the
Fedora Documentation Project or translate for the Fedora Localization
Project, talk with your group to see if there are ideas you can turn in
to a student proposal, with another sub-project member as the mentor.

### What are my chances of having a proposal accepted?

This is the first year we are running a solo summer coding program, and
many details are being finalized in parallel with taking and reviewing
proposals. For example, sponsors are still being sought, which affects
the size of the funding pool. We'll announce this information as it is
known and decided; final funding-per-student may vary and is dependent
on the quality of proposals as well as size of funding pool.

We may not be able to fund as many projects as we ran under the Google
Summer of Code, but our goal is on quality and not quantity.

We intend to run Fedora Summer Coding in the future. One idea is to run
it for the summer in the Southern Hemisphere (Sep 2010 to Feb 2011). If
you don't get in this round, keep trying! You are welcome to keep
lurking and offering ways to help improve the program for future rounds.

## You are a mentor

Wanting to be a mentor is a good thing. Join the [discussion
list](http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding-discuss)
and tell us about yourself, your project idea, and so forth.

You must be committed to work with the student and be a liaison between
the student, sub-projects, upstreams, and the overall project (Fedora
Project or JBoss.org.) You can come from a Fedora sub-project, an
upstream such as a JBoss.org project, from a university or college
sponsoring students, as a few examples.

After discussion on the main Summer Coding 2010 list, you will be
invited to join the private mentor discussion list

### Timeline for mentors

### Step-by-step for mentors

### What to do with your ideas

Put them here on the : [Summer Coding ideas](ideas.xml) page. Reference
[How to create an idea page for Summer
Coding](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_idea_page_for_Summer_Coding)
when creating your idea.

We are looking in to using [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org) for
managing ideas. If you are interested in learning more about that, join
us on the [Summer Coding SIG mailing
list](http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding).

### How to work with students {#how-to-work-with-students}

One way is to provide an idea for students to work on. This idea might
be very well planned out, in which case you may need a high-level of
contact with the student to get it implemented correctly.

It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of how an
idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills and
interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than finding a
student with enough skills to respond to a use case need.

Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student who
works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use case you
have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are more
likely to get somewhere with self-direction.

You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to your
sub-project. This requires a different level of communication throughout
the project, but can be the most rewarding.

### Mentor responsibilities {#mentor-responsibilities}

You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
success, and the success for your overall organization (Fedora,
JBoss.org, or another).

Your responsibilities include:

&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora
or JBoss.org. &#42; Helping students communicate with the overall
project and any upstreams. &#42; Be the final, accountable person for
deciding if the student is successful or not, which affects payment.

### Are you committed to working with all parties?

You need to be committed to working on your part of the Fedora Summer
Coding 2010 for it to be successful. You may want to work with another
mentor (*co-mentoring*) to ensure there is always someone available to
work with the student and other project members.

### How to comment on proposals

## You are a sub-project

Sub-projects are teams working on discrete parts of the Fedora Project
or JBoss.org. For example:

&#42; Fedora Infrastructure &#42; RHQ &#42; Fedora Docs Team &#42;
Drools &#42; Fedora Website Team

### Timeline for sub-projects

sub-projects](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010&#35;Step-by-step_for_sub-projects)

### Working with students and the Summer Coding program

You can gain a lot of value from students working via the Summer Coding
program in your sub-project area; read [GSoC report
2009](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSoC_report_2009) for examples.

Your sub-project may need to identify a single mentor to work with the
student, if the mentor doesn't come from somewhere else in
Fedora/JBoss.org. In addition, you want a back-up mentor or, in some
cases, co-mentors, to ensure continuity for the student and the rest of
the sub-project.

If you have ideas/problems you want students to work on, they are best
served to the students as use cases. If you do have a strong plan for
execution, make that clear in the idea so the student knows it is more
of a guided project.

Some experience shows that student projects have a higher success rate
for all involved when more of the initial idea is from the student. Keep
that in mind as you create ideas.

Ideas can be divided in to several parts for different students. There
are no explicit limitations on how students may interact on multiple
parts of a project. For example, two students could team build a new
component instead of working on two discrete components separately.

## You are a sponsoring organization

Fedora Summer Coding is about connecting sponsors (those with resources
to share) with students (those with time, passion, and skills to share.)

### Timeline for sponsoring organizations

### Step-by-step for sponsors

[Summer Coding 2010 step-by-step for
sponsors](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010&#35;Step-by-step_for_sponsors)

### Why you should be a sponsor?

What do you get out of it?

&#42; Positively impact FOSS projects. &#42; Get your brand in front of
smart students who want to work on FOSS. &#42; Potentially end up
[hiring great developers through the
program](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSoC_report_2009&#35;Recruiting_new_Red_Hat_associates).
&#42; Work on a community program that demonstrates how open source
business is done. &#42; See something you'd like coded be completed.
&#42; Other positive brand associations.

### What you need to do

We need to start talking, soon.

&#42; Open by default on the discuss list -
<http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding-discuss>
&#42; Private via direct email to project leadership - [Karsten
Wade](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Quaid), &#8230;

What are the resources you can supply?

1.  Money to pay stipends to students for spending focused time on these
    FOSS projects. This is a cross between a summer job and an
    internship.

2.  Someone to help coordinate and to contribute as part of the Fedora
    Summer Coding special interest group (SIG).

3.  Mentors, especially if they work actively in sub-project or area the
    sponsor is supporting.

### What does the Summer Coding program do?

The Fedora Summer Coding mentors sort the student ideas, generate the
list of approved proposals, work with the students throughout the
summer, and make sure you hear back about how things went.

It's not necessary as a sponsor to have ideas of how your resources
should be used, that's what the Fedora Project and JBoss.org mentors and
sub-projects are prepared to do.

You can learn more about the model we are using in this blog post,
[Summer Of Code Swimchart: Now With More
Generic.](http://blog.melchua.com/2010/03/04/summer-of-code-swimchart-now-with-more-generic/)

## You are an upstream

### Timeline for upstreams

### Step-by-step for upstreams

[Summer Coding 2010 step-by-step for
upstreams](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010&#35;Step-by-step_for_upstreams)

### Has a student brought a project idea to you?

Please join the [discussion
list](http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding-discuss)
and talk with us about it. We'll ask at least one member of your project
to be on that list throughout the 2010 program. It is not a requirement,
and you can best work it out with the student's assigned mentor.

### Do you have one or more ideas you want exposed to students?

As long as the idea is relevant for the Fedora Summer Coding program,
you can put it on the [Summer Coding 2010 ideas](ideas.xml) page. Follow
the process on that page.

As this is a program for the Fedora Project and JBoss.org, there must be
some benefit to those projects for your upstream idea. When you bring
the topic to the discussion list, be prepared to talk about that.

There must be a demonstrable benefit to Fedora, even if it is only
updated code in a package. Another example is having a student do the
work of getting your software packaged for Fedora. All of your ideas and
ramifications should be topics on the discussion mailing list.

### Are you committed to working with all parties?

A project needs a mentor. Throwing an idea over the wall on to the wiki
page doesn't get it the attention it needs to be part of the Summer
Coding program. If you put an idea out there but do not have a mentor in
mind for it, it is left open to the Summer Coding mentors and
administators to sort out.

When considering a proposal, the mentors look at the amount of
connection with upstream is required, and how strong the communication
channels are. A stronger connection means the proposal looks better.

## You are a Campus Ambassador

Campus Ambassadors should work to guide new interests through this
process. They should work in both generating interest in Fedora Summer
Coding within the Fedora Community and also generating interest in
Fedora within student contributors.

Campus Ambassadors should then guide new contributors in helping them
get set up with mentors and helping submit their Summer Coding proposal.

## Process {#process}

1.  Think in terms of use cases.

    :: If you provide a use case and some ideas of how to solve, you
    give more room for students to put in their own ideas and passion.

    Consider if that is possible for each of your project ideas.

2.  Prepare a project idea page, part of which is included on this page.

    :: To learn how to add an idea to this page, read [How to create an
    idea page for Summer
    Coding](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_idea_page_for_Summer_Coding).

## Welcome Wizard

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* A step by step process of joining the Fedora Project.

*Contacts:* [Mike McGrath](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mmcgrath)

*Mentor(s):* [Mike
McGrath](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mmcgrath)

*Notes:* Right now when new users sign up for an account, they have NO
idea what to do next. One common thing is applying for a bunch of
seemingly random groups, then trying to ssh to fedorapeople. Then just
having your applications sit there&#8230; forever never getting
approved.

I'd like for the account system to have a simple wizard interface (via a
plugin), welcomes users, explains how Fedora works and explains how to
apply for groups and what to expect. We may have to come up with a
standard way to apply for groups, to be discussed.

## PackageDB Enhancements

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* The Fedora PackageDB contains information that both
developers and end users would find useful about the applications and
packages in Fedora. There are a large variety of changes that could be
useful for it ranging from the mundane (example: porting to TurboGears2,
adjusting the way we link between the Application and Package
interfaces) to redesigning the database model, or including new
features.

## Copr

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Copr (Cool Other Package Repo) is a Fedora project to
help make building and managing third party package repositories easy.
Copr is being implemented this summer by Seth Vidal and Toshio Kuratomi.
They would welcome help from interested students.

## Gnome - Nautilus Search dialog

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* Nautilus is the default file manager for Gnome
desktop. The current state of the search dialog is suboptimal, our goal
is to make it more rich and provide more options. For example, when we
had set Tracker as the primary search engine, we also committed users to
use their fulltext search by default. An option switching between
filename-based matching and fulltext search would be great addition.
Additional filters would also be a great asset.

[Ben Boeckel (mathstuf)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mathstuf)

*Notes:* CHASM, the Cryptographic-Hash-Algorithm-Secured Mirroring
solution, is a project that is to help alleviate a lot of the pains that
mirrors have in organizing and verifying their content. The project can
be thought of as a stateful &#96;rsync&#96; daemon in some respects, and
solves a problem that kernel.org and a number of other large mirroring
infrastructures have been looking into for several years now. This is
ultimately a project that will be used by a greater portion of the
larger mirroring infrastructures and as such has a lot of need for high
performance and good design.

## DGC GTK GUI

*Notes:* The idea is to develop an application which would allow Mentors
and Students to collaborate effectively and get the process of mentoring
automated.

## Kronikarz - Simple Tool for Desktop Backup / Restore

*Status:* \'Idea\'

*Summary of idea:* Handy graphical tool for archiving settings of
desktop applications. This tool will be useful for users who:

&#42; want to simply backup / restore look-and-feel and settings of
desktop applications; &#42; frequently migrate from one distribution to
another; &#42; have more then one device and want to sync settings.

*Contacts:* [Alexei Panov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Elemc)

*Mentor(s):* [Alexei Panov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Elemc)

*Notes:* Tool can be written to work with plugins (preferrable) or just
bunch of configuration files to describe backup / restore / sync methods
and enable support for certain application.

Proposed features:

&#42; Easy search and select installed applications for backup / restore
/ sync &#42; Can work as application or as daemon &#42; Has scheduler
and backup / restore / sync settings (archive type, passwords,
compression rate, additive/solid, etc.) &#42; Custom selection of
applications for archiving (one, group, all, etc.) &#42; Restoring data
from archive with tracking of current application, nonexistent on target
machine applications should be reinstalled from PackageKit &#42;
Including user selected files in archive for restoring on target machine
(possibly searching and automatic including configuration files or files
of specified types).

## Unified Mobile Sync

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* Synchronization tool for mobile devices. The creation
of tool for data synchronization between mobile devices and desktop,
such as contacts, calendar, schedule, tasks, messages. Today mobility is
a major trend, so enabling synchronization between mobile and desktop is
important for Linux desktop adoption.

*Contacts:* [Alexey
Vasyukov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anganar)

*Mentor(s):* For the moment [Alexey
Vasyukov](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anganar)

*Notes:* Proposed features:

&#42; Synchronization of contacts and calendar (required), tasks and
messages (desired) &#42; Support for popular mobile devices, simple
extensibility for new gadgets via plugins &#42; Support for popular
desktop applications, simple extensibility for other via plugins &#42;
Simple graphical synchronization tuning tool -- what to synchronize,
scheduling, rules (filters, conflict resolution, etc.) &#42; Enabling
mobile device backup and restore &#42; Desirably running not only on
Linux, but also on Windows and MacOS (TBD) &#42; Think about future
integration with open source collaboration suites and unified
communication systems.

*Current state*

The current stage (stage 1) is about research and architecture design.
It can not be stuck to certain technologies. You need a broad vision of
different technologies to be successful at this stage.

Current stage will take at least 2-3 months. After it we will determine
coding tasks and timeline and proceed to stage 2 - prototype
implementation.

The tasks for current stage:

&#42; Find out how to upload/download to/from popular mobile devices
(Android, iPhone, Symbian, PalmOS, Win Mobile, BB, etc) contacts,
messages, calendars, todos, media content, etc. It includes studying
what data is accessible, in what format we are to process it, what
protocols-libraries-APIs should be used. As a result we should get clear
understanding what and how can be synced for different devices. This
task will require gathering and reading tons of technical documentation
and writing code to check if documentation is really true. I can not
predict what programming languages, libraries, standards and protocols
you will encounter.

&#42; Find out how to upload/download to/from popular desktop apps
(Evolution, Thunderbird, KDE PIM, Outlook, etc) contacts, messages,
calendars, todos, media content, etc. Once again, it includes studing
what is accessible, in what format, via which channels. As a result we
should get clear understanding what and how can be synced with different
apps. This task will require, similarly with the previous one, reading
documentation and writing tests. Once again, I can not predict what
programming languages, libraries, standards and protocols you will
encounter.

&#42; Find out how to integrate mobile sync into current system
infrastructure for Linux desktop (dbus, udev, PackageKit, etc) and,
probably, Windows desktop (???). This task will require very good
knowledge of system design.

&#42; Prepare concept of GUI application and implement the first version
(with placeholders instead of real sync plugins). This task will require
knowledge of cross-platform programming with Python or C/C++ and
GTK/Qt/etc. Knowledge of GUI design and usability will be a big
advantage.

&#42; Prepare the architecture based on the results of tasks &#35;1-4.
The architecture should meet the requirements \[1\]. Determine tasks for
complete UMS implementation.

From my point of view each of the tasks &#35;1-4 will require few
person-months. Task &#35;5 will be solved collaboratively.

## KDE fingerprint support for various components

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* The aim of this project is to finish fingerprint
support for various KDE core components and package it for Fedora. The
current code supports KDM login &amp; KDE locking and sits in KDE SVN
playground. Support to other KDE componenets have to be done - Polkit
KDE auth. agent, kdesu etc. Code should be accepted by upstream and
should go through KDE review to be shipped in official KDE SC releases.

## KDE Usability recording tool

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* Usability engineers regularly administer usability
sessions. Within these sessions there are a number of things that they
need to record:

The three most notable are the screen of the user being tested

&#42; An external camera source

&#42; An external microphone

These must be compressed and multiplexed together, compressed. The tool
must be able to open these files, export them to other more conventional
types, i.e. an OGG simply of the users screen.

## GNU Smalltalk package revamping

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* The GNU Smalltalk virtual machine is a monolithic
package in Fedora, and is not updated often. By contrast, the Debian
package separates all of the provided bindings into separate packages,
which allows to install the VM with fewer dependencies---for example
without GTK+ support, or without Expat, and so on.

The project aims at providing a similar level of flexibility for the
Fedora package. In addition, it would be good to have a way to generate
from the same source the Fedora .spec file, the Windows installer
(currently done with a custom shell script that uses the Fedora mingw32
cross-compilation environment), and the Debian package.

## Unified ink level reporting

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* Several printer drivers are capable of reporting the
amount of remaining ink or toner in the printer they are driving, but
they all do it in different ways. Usually there is a command line
program that the user has to know about and run (and interpret the
output). For gutenprint there is escputil. For HPLIP there is hp-levels.
And so on.

CUPS provides a unified framework for all drivers to report marker
levels in the same way, viewed and queried from a single user interface.
The same interface can be used for other \'special\' functions such as
cleaning/aligning the print heads, printing a self-test page, etc. We
just need the printer drivers to conform to this way of doing things.

Changing both gutenprint and hplip would be sufficient to cover a large
number of printer models.

## Customizable application installer

*Status:* Accepting Applications

*Summary of idea:*

Ailurus is an application installer \[1\]. It lists specific software
for specific task. It lists few software, rather than all packages in
Fedora repository. It helps new users because new users can find out
software they want directly, rather than do searching in a lot of
packages. Many Fedora users are using Ailurus now.

Our goal is to make Ailurus *customizable*. For example, users can add
comment for software. Software introduction can be changed. New software
items can be added. Existing software items can be removed. Under the
user's permission, the changes to the software items can be uploaded to
a web service on google app-engine, therefore other users will obtain a
benefit by downloading the changes. This application installer supports
extensions. Users can add their own function.

## Gnome File Sharing Administration Tool

*Status:* Idea

*Summary of idea:* KDE has taken an advance on file sharing which is
Kcm-filesharing by allowing the user list all samba/nfs shares and allow
the user to configure the shares centrally and graphically, while which
is required but not supplied by Gnome. The proposed project aims to
create a utility that should provide a graphical administration tool to
configure both samba system shares and nfs shares. It is able to manage
the file sharing management, authentication, and other most worthy
configurations of samba and nfs.

## Freeseer portable presentation/demo capture station

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:*

Freeseer is a portable presentation capture tool. It captures vga
output/firewire/webcam/local desktop and audio and mixes them together
to produce a video thus enabling you to capture great presentations,
demos, or training material easily. The ideas for this project implement
various features to improve the Freeseer video capture software.

pick one or more scenarios and create a concrete implementation plan.

## Shotwell slideshows/printing

The main page for this idea is
<http://trac.yorba.org/wiki/SummerCodeIdeas> .

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Shotwell is the default photo manager in Fedora 13.
Yorba (the open source group that develops Shotwell) is looking for
students interested in working on two different aspects of Shotwell this
summer.

First, slideshows. Today, Shotwell's slideshows are primitive: photos
are simply displayed in succession with no transitions of any sort. We'd
like to implement fancier slideshows with cool-looking transitions. If
time permits, it would be great to add captions and/or music to
slideshows as well.

Second, printing. Today, printing in Shotwell is basic: you can simply
print one photo per page on a white background. We'd like to let the
user print multiple photos per page, choose fancy borders and background
colors and so on.

## Cobbler

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Various ideas related to Cobbler :
<http://fedorahosted.org/cobbler>

*Contacts:* MichaelDeHaan

*Mentor(s):* MichaelDeHaan

*Notes:* The cobbler project is a Linux (and soon to be other OS)
installation server with numerous datacenter automation features.
Possible ideas for GSOC include web app workflow improvements, or a
collection of many numerous RFEs in Fedora Hosted's Trac instance
(fedorahosted.org/cobbler). Students should also have their own original
ideas and an interest in datacenter automation --- folks doing admin
work for their college and interested in using cobbler are ideal. We are
interested in folks that (A) can show they understand the goals of the
project and understand it's present features (as to not reinvent things
it already does or are out of scope), (B) have new ideas of their own
and are creative, and © are interested in the domain of datacenter
automation, systems management, virtualization, or constructing SkyNet.
Some knowledge of Python, Perl, Ruby, or a similar dynamic language is
required. Cobbler is all Python so if you're a Python hacker, we'd be
especially glad to have you. If you'd like to contact me to refine your
ideas prior to submitting or just ask questions, that's great, please do
so. (mdehaan AT redhat DOT com)

## InstantMirror

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* There exist various existing repository replication
methods to mirror repositories, each with their own pros and cons.
InstantMirror aims to solve problems of data repository replication in
an efficient way. Various modern techniques are utilized and combined
like Squid-like reverse proxy cache and cache expiry algorithm,
rsync-like local directory trees, Torrent style efficient swarming
many-to-many data replication. This project if implemented would
dramatically improve the efficiency and timeliness of repository
replication. This could be very useful for mirror networks like
kernel.org, Fedora, Debian, CPAN, etc. \'\'\' n *Contacts:* WarrenTogami

## Packages End User UI

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* A User Interface to the PackageDB for end users to
find and review packages

*Contacts:* Toshio Kuratomi

*Mentor(s):* Toshio Kuratomi

*Notes:* This idea has already been taken up and a more detailed
proposal worked on by maploin, Ionuț Arțăriși

Many Linux distributions have a website that shows what packages are
present in the distribution to users of the distribution. These websites
have pages that tell what the software does, how to use it, what version
it is, and so on. We'd like to add the same capabilities to the Fedora
Package Database so that Fedora Users can come there to see what
packages are in Fedora.

We also want to add a few features that aren't in other systems.

&#42; The ability to filter these as applications instead of packages,
&#42; Letting end users comment on the applications to help other end
users &#42; Letting end users tag the packages with keywords to make
searching easier

More details here:

&#42; <https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb/wiki/EndUserUI>

## New Developer UI for the PackageDB

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Update the Packager's User Interface to be more
efficient.

*Contacts:* Toshio Kuratomi

*Mentor(s):* Toshio Kuratomi

*Notes:* This idea has already been taken up and a more detailed
proposal worked on by Ranjith Kannikara

The Package Database provides an adequate interface to managing acls on
packages but there are some definite warts that cause our packagers to
spend too much time on the beaurocracy of maintaining packages rather
than coding. This proposal is to address several outstanding feature
requests and create some new interfaces that will make managing package
acls much easier.

More details here:

&#42; <https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb/wiki/NewDevUI>

## Robotics LiveCD with Simulator Environment

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Create a LiveCD that provides a simulation
environment and tools to start robotics experiments.

*Contacts:* [Tim Niemueller](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Timn)

*Mentor(s):* Don't know, would like to be the student

*Notes:* I would like to integrate the robot software that I've
developed at university (and that is going to be released to the public
real soon now as GPL'ed OSS) into Fedora, then integrate the
Gazebo/Stage simulators properly into Fedora and the software and
provide a simple development playground that one can use to make the
robots move in the simulation and solve tasks. Maybe a simple task-based
game (get the robot to pick the can and bring it to the place marked
with X) could come out of it. My diploma/master thesis (that I'm
finishing atm) is about efficient and simple behavior control employing
Lua, so this would be a really good fit. This project would be embedded
into the [Fedora Robotics
SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Robotics).

## Spacewalk

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* PostgreSQL support in Spacewalk

*Contacts:* JesusRodriguez

*Mentor(s):* JesusRodriguez

*Notes:* Spacewalk is an open source Linux systems management solution.
It allows you to:

&#42; Inventory your systems (hardware and software information) &#42;
Install and update software on your systems &#42; Collect and distribute
your custom software packages into manageable groups &#42; Provision
(Kickstart) your systems &#42; Manage and deploy configuration files to
your systems &#42; Monitor your systems &#42; Provision virtual guests
&#42; Start/stop/configure virtual guests

Currently Spacewalk works only with Oracle, which is why enabling it to
work with PostgreSQL would be a great project.

## Fedora Feature

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Create any open ended Feature which must be approved,
and will be included in Fedora 12

*Contacts:* [Yaakov Nemoy](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ynemoy)

*Mentor(s):* Yaakov Nemoy

*Notes:* For more information [click this link

## PackageKit: fix app-install

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Fix app-install problems and let it be accepted to
Fedora.

*Contacts:* Richard Hughes

*Mentor(s):* Richard Hughes

*Notes:*

See [this blog
post](http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2009/03/05/application-installing/)
about more information of app-install in general.

See
[fedora-app-install](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488968)
review request about problems expressed.

At least the following problems are addressed:

&#42; Layout of app-install metadata and application icons inside of
repository, &#42; Pregenerating of app-install metadata and icons, &#42;
Change app-install to download metadata from repository, &#42; Learn
app-install to download icons on demand.

## EKG

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Help build a community scanner that gives detailed
statistics and provides visualizations about what the Open Source
community is up to.

*Contacts:* [ Yaakov Nemoy](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ynemoy),
[Michael DeHaan](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Michael_DeHaan), Max
Spevack

*Mentor(s):* Yaakov Nemoy and Michael DeHaan

*Notes:* EKG (<http://fedorahosted.org/ekg>) is a tool that lets us
monitor community mailing lists and see where traffic is coming from.
What projects are becoming more popular? What is the mix of people
posting to various lists? What's the pulse on the community?

As a contributor, you will help extend EKG to track additional
resources, mine new data, and create new visualizations, metrics, and
comparisons. We will measure the contributions by company and
organisation and community members. There is a lot of room for work in
web visualization, whether this means making new charts and graphs or
attempting to find ways to show a lot of information at a glance.

You will get to work with the following technologies:

&#42; Python &#42; HTML &#42; Javascript &#42; SQLAlchemy &#42; Python
templating languages

Students should bring some of their own ideas to table when submitting
proposals. This may be a very good project for a student with interests
in data mining, statistics, or (2D) data visualization.

## JBoss.org ideas

The JBoss.org crew is proposing as a mentoring organization with the
Fedora Project, as has been done in the past. That ideas page is here:

<http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-13401>

## Transifex ideas

The Transifex team is proposing ideas under the Fedora Project mentoring
organization for this year's Summer of Code.

Coding includes Python and Django, Web frameworks, workflow development,
and the chance to contribute to something used by quite a few folks.

A full list of ideas can be found on the Transifex wiki page:

<http://transifex.org/wiki/Development/SummerCoding/Ideas>

## Augeas

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Various ideas around Augeas : <http://augeas.net/>

*Contacts:* [David
Lutterkort](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lutter)

*Mentor(s):* [David
Lutterkort](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lutter)

Augeas is a command line tool and library to make editing of
configuration files from programs and scripts easier. It does that by
parsing existing configuration files into a tree, allowing modifications
of the tree through an API, and writing the tree back to the original
configuration file with those modifications.

There are a wide variety of interesting projects to enhance Augeas
itself or build tools on top of it. Depending on the specific project,
required skills range from learning the ins and outs of specific config
files to python scripting and the ability to solve hard research
problems.

Detailed list of ideas at <http://www.augeas.net/page/Project_Ideas>

## Better iptables management

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Write a tool to help understand and modify iptables
rules

*Contacts:* [David
Lutterkort](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lutter)

*Mentor(s):* [David
Lutterkort](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lutter)

The iptables config is a scary file, especially when programs need to
modify it, since making a change often requires that the program
understands what a chain does in its entirety. It would be much better
to have a tool that can answer questions like \'What does chain X do to
packets that look like this ?\' and \'Modify chain X to
ACCEPT/DROP/REJECT packets that look like this\' in a way that avoids
redundant rules. Solutions to these are described in a few research
papers.

You should have a basic knowledge of iptables configuration, interest in
writing OCaml (preferred) or C code, and be willing to learn about some
theoretical concepts like binary decision diagrams (BDD's)

## Backup system on btrfs

*Status:* Proposed

*Summary of idea:* Write a backup system on btrfs (use snapshots )

*Contacts:* [ Kushal Das](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kushal)

*Mentor(s):* [ Kushal Das](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kushal)

btrfs is upcoming filesystem which is already there in rawhide. It
include unique feature of create snapshots, one can easily go back to
the previous states of the files using that. In the current condition it
is better to take snapshots of subvolumes only.

Primary task will be to create an independent GUI based app to browse
the history. In future one can patch the major file managers for this
feature.

# Ideas for Student Projects for 2008

This page gathers all the ideas and pointers/references for the 2008
intern and Summer coding programs.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| &#42;If you see an idea here you want to learn about or hack on,      |
| contact the people associated with the idea.&#42;                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

JBoss.org project ideas are found here:
[1](http://labs.jboss.com/wiki/GSoC)

*What could these students do for Fedora with a Summer?*

Projects can occur in an upstream, as long as the work happens through
Fedora and benefits Fedora.

Feel free to comment on the ideas posted here, putting your WikiName in
front of your comments. The goal is to consider ideas as *proposed*
until they have faced sufficient peer review, i.e., have stayed
unscathed on the page for a while.

## Apport

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* The QA team has a half finished port of Ubuntu\'
Apport, it would greatly enhance the handling of crash reporting if we
were able to finish this work.

*Contacts:* Added by DavidNielsen, I have no skills but hopefully
WillWoods will be able to function as mentor. KyleMcMartin is willing to
mentor this.

*Notes:* More information Apport can be found here:
<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport>

## Package WebUI

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* We need a web interface that is made for end-users to
access information about packages. This will be similar to
packages.debian.org or packages.gentoo.org in some ways but we hope to
improve on those in several ways.

*Contacts:* [ Toshio
Kuratomi(abadger1999)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:ToshioKuratomi)
has agreed to take point on this. Interaction with other developers will
likely be needed as this touches many systems. Luke Macken(lmacken),
John Palmieri(J5), Ricky Zhou(ricky), Seth Vidal(skvidal), and Mike
Bonnet(mbonnet) are all involved in projects that touch on the work to
be done here.

*Notes:* This needs to be an enhancement of the [Package
Database](https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb) . The DB schema will need
additional tables to reflect the enduser view of data. We'll need to
generate dynamic web pages to display the information to the end user
and allow them to give feedback/enhanced information about a package.

*Design Requirements:*

&#42; This must integrate with the PackageDB. Therefore it will be a
piece of a larger TurboGears application. Knowledge of TurboGears and
python is not required but a willingness to program in them is :-) &#42;
It is meant to be task and application oriented rather than package
oriented. The aim is to answer questions like \'What application will
let me make drawings?\' \'Is there a python library for formatting
documentation?\' \'I don't like \'deluge\' but I need something that
does a similar thing?\' &#42; We already have package information in
several sources. We want to avoid duplicating information where possible
but for efficiency we may need to pull some of the data into our
database. &#42; The interface should link back and forth with the
existing PackageDB but it is not simply another view of the data.
Additional data will be involved. &#42; Allowing the user to contribute
to the knowledge about the package is a goal.

A mockup of what a page could look like is in the [MyFedora
proposal](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MyFedora?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=info-mockup.png)
. Note that the header information is MyFedora UI rather than PackageDB
Ui and we'd want to be describing gimp as an application rather than
gimp as a package.

## Jack driver for Audacity

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* The Jack Audio Connection Kit enables low latency
interapplication audio connections. Many applications currently in
Fedora support it and can connect to each other and to the audio card.
Audacity is one of them. But its Jack support depends on PortAudio, and
to be kind, PortAudio Jack support is sorely lacking. Audacity is an
extremely popular audio editor but its main weakness is its lack of a
proper native Jack driver. Having one would make it a lot more useful in
the context of an audio content creation environment.

*Contacts:* Added by [Fernando Lopez
](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:FernandoLopezLezcano)

*Notes:* Why is the PortAudio driver not so good?

It cannot react dynamically to changes in the Jack graph, that is, Jack
applications already running can be seen by Audacity, applications
started after Audacity starts are invisible until Audacity is restarted.

Jack ports can only be selected in the Preferences menu of Audacity. The
standard way of handling this in Jack applications is that in the
preferences menu you select either the Jack driver or an auto discovery
mode. If the Jack driver is selected then the application will connect
(register ports) to it on startup (if Jack is running) and will register
input and output ports with Jack. Those will be seen in the Jack graph
and can be source or sink of audio information to/from other apps and/or
the soundcard. Normally the connection with other apps or the soundcard
is done externally. Some programs add internal means of connecting to
other apps and that is generally not done through the preferences menu
(Jack is dynamic), and can show applications that started after (in this
case) Audacity starts. Some programs have the extra option of connecting
automatically on startup to the first n physical audio output ports
which facilitates trivial use of the program.

BastienNocera: we use PulseAudio by default in Fedora, and I don't
really see the point of using Jack if we use PulseAudio for \'normal\'
users (most users won't be changing that default). You're better off
pushing this request to an Audacity SoC project.

## Func / Network Automation

*Status:*

&#42; *Being worked on by User:bombshelter13\[Gregory Masseau\]
(<gjmasseau@learn.senecac.on.ca>)*

&#42; *Being worked on by User:miltonpaiva\[Milton Paiva\]
(<mpaivaneto@learn.senecac.on.ca>)*

*Summary of idea:* Func is a network applications framework that allows
for powerful remote manipulation and scripting of very large numbers of
Fedora machines.

This idea is to expand Func by writing lots of useful modules to do all
sorts of powerful remote things, making it into the world's best API for
remote scripting Fedora over lots of machines at once --- with an
emphasis on integrating Func with other tools we already have in Fedora.
This would be a particular good project for someone who had an interest
in networking, clusters, automation, or security related topics.
Contributions to Func wouldn't be limited to just writing modules, as
anything networking/automation related is fair game. Contact
MichaelDeHaan for more information.

*Contacts:* MichaelDeHaan

*Notes:* see <https://fedorahosted.org/func>

## koji hiding binaries/ import secondary repos

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* For various reasons we need to be able to use a
second repo. but still know what was in the build root. or to be able to
hide builds for pre-release, security issues. Koji needs to be able to
import repodata and know where binaries are while not making them
available. We walso want to be able to mark a build as being embargoed
and hide it completely. from cvs through to the build happening. to be
opened up when embargo is done.

*Contacts:* DennisGilmore

*Notes:* <https://fedorahosted.org/koji>

## Integrate Fedora Infrastructure and Eclipse

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* At present, there is a largely functional specfile
editor plugin for Eclipse shipping in Fedora. It would be nice to expand
the usefulness of the plugin with the ability to push builds to koji.
Using mock from within Eclipse and doing pkgdb and bodhi work would also
be nice.

*Contacts:* AndrewOverholt

*Notes:*

## A Gobby plugin for Eclipse

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* The Eclipse Communications Framework has shared
editing support. It would be nice to have a gobby backend for this so
that Eclipse users could take advantage of Fedora's existing gobby
server.

*Contacts:* AndrewOverholt

*Notes:*
<http://blog.mricon.com/2008/02/why-is-there-no-gobby-support-in.html> ,
<https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=219829>

## Windows Data Migration Tool

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Anaconda supports partition resizing (including NTFS)
in Rawhide now. It would be great to combine this with a data migration
tool for Windows or dual booting users.

*Contacts:* RahulSundaram

*Notes:* I only have the general idea. Others more qualified, feel free
to volunteer

## Automatic Updates with dynamic bandwidth throttling

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* The idea is to update the system using idle bandwidth
in an asynchronous, prioritized and throttled manner, i.e to update
packages asynchronously from the server. This way the user can continue
working while the updated packages are being downloaded without any
noticeable changes in bandwidth.

Updates can be done automatically by a cron job or with yum-updatesd,
but this will make yum/pup to use whole of the bandwidth. yum has a
throttle option but it decides the upper limit of usage of bandwidth.
Whereas, with asynchronous mode, limit can be decided dynamically
depending upon the current usage. In many developing countries most of
the people are on low bandwidth networks or have limited access to
Internet. This will help them to keep their system updated with maximum
utilization of their bandwidth.

*Contacts:* SunilKumarGhai

*Notes:* \[1\] We can also have some kind of general framework, which
can be used by other applications to use throttling in services they
provide. \[2\] We can implement this with repositories over http only.
ftp repositories will not work. \[3\] Maybe work with
PackageKit? --- RichardHughes

\@RichardHughes: As the idea is moving in development of framework as
mentioned in \[1\] point, we would be able to use it. But still as
PackageKit has YUM backend so only http repositories will
work. --- sunil

## Corresponding Source Web App

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Finish design and implement web application that
provides downloadable SRPMS for any package+tag in the Fedora Package
Source Code Control system. While we provide SRPMS for all packages at
release, the updates and rawhide trees churn their packages more
rapidly, and will remove the koji-built SRPMS when the binary packages
are removed. This would allow people to request source corresponding to
the packages they have on ISO media or otherwise.

*Contacts:* MattDomsch

*Notes:*
<http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=correspondingsource.git;a=blob;f=DESIGN;hb=HEAD>
has mdomsch's thoughts on how it should work.

## Extend Bootchart to support SystemTap

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Bootchart is a tool for performance analysis, and
visualization of the Linux boot process. At present, bootchart uses a
logger script to collect the boot information from the /proc interface.
It also uses a parser to extract information in a non-standardized
format. It would be nice to:

&#42; extend bootchart to collect information using SystemTap instead.
&#42; code the boot information in XML format. &#42; explore additional
metrics that would make bootchart more useful, i.e. finding out the
working set size at various points of the boot process, etc. &#42; test
bootchart on Fedora 8/9/rawhide dom0/domU/kvm/etc. &#42; propose (and
possibly implement) suggestions on how we can improve the boot process.

*Skills needed:* Strong background in Operating Systems. Familiarity
with Python, Java/JAXP, XML and C programming. Some experience in kernel
internals would be helpful, but not necessary.

*Contact:* EugeneTeo, eteo_at_fedoraproject_dot_org

*Notes:* See <http://bootchart.org/>,
<http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/>,
<http://people.redhat.com/berrange/systemtap/bootprobe/>

## A visualization tool for SystemTap

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* SystemTap provides an infrastructure that simplifies
the gathering of information about the running Linux kernel, so that it
can be further analyzed for performance or functional issues. This
project involves writing a graphical tool for visualizing this
information in real-time, so that anomalies can be easily identified.
The tool should use configuration files in XML format to describe how it
should interpret the output of the scripts. Users should be able to
extend the tool by adding new SystemTap scripts. How information should
be visualized meaningfully requires more thought during the design
phase. One of the main objectives is to make SystemTap user-friendly,
and easy to use.

*Update:* I wrote the following to a student recently. Here's more
description of the project: The objective of the project is to create a
visualization tool that we can display graphs and statistics in a
meaningful way. Another objective is to investigate how we can gather
important statistics from SystemTap, and have it formatted in a way that
is easy for the tool to display the results. I am not looking at yet
another gnome-system-monitor though. A user should be able to specify a
systemtap script, have it conform to a specific output format, write a
XML configuration file to describe the input format, and output format,
and have the visualization tool display it.

For example, we want to monitor lock contention in Linux. We write a
script to get hold of futex locks. We write a XML configuration file,
specify the output format of the script, and then display the
graphs/statistics.

&#8230;. program locks app1 &#35;245 &#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;
app2 &#35;23 &#35;&#35;&#35; app3 &#35;423
&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;
&#8230;.

Another example, we want to monitor I/O activities in the system, we
take an existing script, modify it to display output for the
visualization tool. We write a XML configuration file, specify how the
output is like, and then display the statistics:

&#8230;. program reads writes app1 234 23 app2 123 2333
/\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\\ app1 */\-\-\--\_\_*/
\|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-- app2
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\_\_*\_*/\-\-\-\-\-\-\--*\_\_\_* &#8230;.

*Skills needed:* Strong background in Operating Systems. Familiarity
with Python/GTK+, and C programming. Some experience in kernel internals
would be helpful, but not necessary.

## PackageKit Offline Use

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Many computers are not connected to the Internet and
cannot be updated easily. A solution should be found to use
libpackagekit and be distribution neutral so all distros can benefit.
For this task, first we would generate top-level use-cases for offline
use, and expand on existing use cases. This task would involve reviewing
[Opyum](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DebarshiRay/Opyum) or
[APTonCD](http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/) for ideas and ways to do
things better.

This would possibly involve using avahi for client-&gt;client transfers,
and would have to deal with the trust issues that arise from this. It
would also involve generating offline packs for automatic install or
automatic update. ServicePack CD's could be shipped on magazine covers
with updates to all the typical fedora applications for people without
inexpensive network access. This could be investigated further.

*Contacts:* RichardHughes, richard_at_hughsie_dot_com

*Notes:* The applicant would need to be familiar with C and a little
python, but would be a great way to get into development of a young
fast-moving software project.

## PackageKit Self Check

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* PackageKit is complex, and relies on many different
parts of the stack, e.g. yum, rpm, dbus, etc. There is currently only
limited build time self-checks in the PackageKit source package. We
would need to design of an end-to-end test harness for packagekit that
would test .rpm and yum on local temporary repositories for a complete
self check of the code pathways and packages used. This could be used to
trivially check each version of these components before being pushed to
an update repository.

python, but would be a great way to get into development of a young
fast-moving software project.

## Non linear ogg editor/ screencast helper

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Still we are missing a good non linear editor for ogg
videos. This can be a simple GUI based application to do non linear
editing of ogg. Like cutting, mixing the videos. Adding still frames to
the video etc. Though this is not a project to be finished within 2-3
months, but we should be able to have a basic application running to do
simple edits. May be having feature of upload videos to fedoratv or
integrate itself with recordmydesktop to get screencasts directly. I am
looking for more ideas on this.

*Contacts:* KushalDas kushaldas AT fedoraproject {NOSPAM} DOT org

*Notes:* Recommended choice of language is Python or C

ValentTurkovic: I have 2 suggestions; First is to try and resurrect Diva
Project who started as GSC project in 2006. Second is to work with
Pitivi Project because it is on a good path and has ogg editing
functionality and easy enough interface. To get an overview of this Diva
Project rise and fall please read these two posts. UPDATE: There are two
projects that look promissing: saya-videoeditor
[2](http://saya-videoeditor.blogspot.com/) and myvideoeditor
[3](http://myvideoeditor.blogspot.com)

## Fedora WebInstall

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* One of the items that other distributions have been
able to accomplish that is still lacking in Fedora is the ability to
have a web link, which will allow an update and/or install using an
approved yum repository. Similar to OpenSUSE's misnamed One-Click
install, or Ubuntu's AptURL feature, building a package repository
reference which then uses PackageKit or something similar.

*Contacts:* ClintSavage herlo AT fedoraproject DOt org

*Notes:* Proof of concepts are available from the Ubuntu and OpenSUSE
website's respectively.

## ILA

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* ILA is \'Sanskrit\' word meaning
\'Terrestrial\'&#8230; The Idea is to integrate all computers reachable
(via any kind of network, internet to be most obvious) into a parallel
web which is reachable by a single click or shortcut&#8230;

let me put the last line as first&#8230; \'A parallel web which doesn't
depends on a central service provider for any of its functions&#8230;
the core part of the node functionality is loaded with the desktop\' so
every computer online/lan is capable of being a node depending on the
modules activated

Its modular so that new features can be made available&#8230;

The architecture, language, implementation are open to discussion&#8230;
I have a few ideas but most relevant thing to write here would be
use-cases which will make the objectives of the project clear..

\\1. A User is stuck on some problem he just clicks a shortcut to make
visible the desktop application goes to query tab and fills the question
then hits \'Ask\'&#8230; now all the other computers (reachable) who
have selected i-want-to-answer-this-type-of-questions (which is
optional) will be shown a popup on the desktop&#8230; all the answers
that are sent are then shown on the system where they originated. \[much
better then a search algorithm you are getting reply from real people\]

\\1. Can be used for file sharing \[no need to explain just like any
good P2P\]

\\1. A modular design will allow users to choose from large number of
attachable modules like the above two such as
Distributed-CPU-Utilization applications (like SETI), Instant messenger,
feeds collector, news (users can add news and everyone can see it in
diff categories)&#8230; \[use your imagination\]

\\1. The only requirement to use a feature or service is just network
reachability. no dependence on any central service provider

First Issue that I see is&#8230; It \'Should\' be usable&#8230; (still
its an abstract statement :-) ) Although I would like it to run on
Fedora and other Distros, porting to any plateforms should be possible
Idea is still in abstract form is \'Remove dependence on centrally
controlled systems&#8230;integrate this functionality in the OS\' so
that new kind of apps/tools/featuers can be created.

## Transifex ideas (&#35;transifex) {#transifex-ideas-transifex}

The following are some ideas on Transifex that came up. Feel free to
contact DimitrisGlezos for more info and/or extend them with new points
in your application.

If you want to discuss any ideas you might have, please contact
DimitrisGlezos right away.

You might also want to take a look at [
L10N/Tools/Plans](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/L10N/Tools/Plans) .

## Transifex: Clients, APIs and RPCs (&#35;tx_client) {#transifex-clients-apis-and-rpcs-tx_client}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Transifex works well as a server and the website workflow works well
with new content providers (eg. translators), however not all users find
the website efficient enough. Implementing an API callable over http
will enable a Command Line Interface, AJAX calls, and integration with
other tools.

*Contacts:*

DimitrisGlezos

*Notes:*

&#42; Duplication of website functionality &#42; Damned Lies
interaction? (eg. &#96;tx get-file anaconda el.po&#96;) &#42; How can we
make login work? &#42; Security a challenge &#42; Hook-up with Pootle as
a use-case scenario? &#42; If the server has plugins enabled, how is
this going to be implemented here? (Interaction with student working on
extensions might be needed) &#42; (&#8230;more ideas?)

## Transifex: Extension engine (&#35;tx_ext) {#transifex-extension-engine-tx_ext}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Refactor Transifex's code with hooks (pre, post commit), overridden
functions, and classes in order to add a plugin/extension mechanism.
Abstract file metaphor, and make support for PO files a plugin and
implement a new one for image submissions.

*Contacts:*

DimitrisGlezos

*Notes:*

&#42; Student might need to work with the student working on the client
to discuss how the client can be extended to implement these plugins.
&#42; Metrics will be needed to see how good the refactoring was, and
what opportunities it will provide --- these metrics would be good to be
mentioned in the application itself. &#42; (&#8230;more ideas?)

## Transifex: Permission and authorization layer (&#35;tx_perm) {#transifex-permission-and-authorization-layer-tx_perm}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Add user/authorization/permission layer on top of Transifex, to improve
the workflow Transifex creates by identifying key user groups and
implementing functionality for each one.

&#42; Developers, administrators, language leaders, editors,
translators, anonymous users: They all have different things to do in
Transifex &#42; Add OpenID support &#42; Introduce string, release,
translation freezes that influence what some users can do &#42;
Fine-grain permissions in Tx: Language maintainers, approvals by
proj/lang/branch, etc. Who owns what, who controls what. Add ability to
\'hold\' and \'release\' a project/branch, like in elvis. &#42;
Requirement for this idea is to work with the creators of Vertimus. This
idea might (or might not) have common ground with Vertimus, and we need
to make sure that either Tx can interoperate with Vertimus, or that the
V folks know what we are working on and see how we can work together
(note: Vertimus is written in PHP, but some interest has been raised for
finding ways to work with Tx).

## Transifex: Add async repo support (&#35;tx_async) {#transifex-add-async-repo-support-tx_async}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Currently Tx requires a constant sync with the remote repo. A submission
triggers a push, and pulls happen continuously. We need to add a feature
to extend this paradigm with submissions living in Tx, until the next
push is run (probably by the developer or an editor).

This way we can enable a bunch of nice stuff like, instead of Tx
pushing, add support for the developer to pull whenever she needs. Also,
having a temporary upload place which needs approval before actually
being committed will help QA and get new translators more easily
(language leaders can review). These could either be used as a temporary
upload space or as a way to allow non-authorized submissions (an
authorized user can move a Draft to an actual submission).

Idea: Split files into multiple chunks and submit them all together?

*Contacts:*

DimitrisGlezos

## Transifex's Submissions revisited (&#35;tx_submissions) {#transifexs-submissions-revisited-tx_submissions}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Currently Tx supports only a small set of submission methods, all tied
in with a version control commit approach. We want to create an abstract
submission system decoupled from vcs. On top of that we want to rebuild
all the current submission methods and to implement a set of other
requested methods such as email delivery, filling a ticket on trac or
bugzilla etc.

In addition a primary goal is to build a CLI Client so translators can
submit their translations directly from their terminal.

*Info:* Proposed by Christos Trochalakis (application: [Tx Submissions
revisited](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ChristosTrochalakis/GSoC/Tx-Submissions)
)

## Transifex: Tx Committer service (&#35;tx_committer) {#transifex-tx-committer-service-tx_committer}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Currently Transifex runs as a web server, running the actual commits
within the same process. This could be a bit of a security risk, and
we'd like to have the commit service run as a different user. An
advantage of this is that any repo can run this committer and control
the submissions instead of giving SSH access to a downstream project.

&#42; Split committer into a different component &#42; Move commit code
outside transifex/ and into transifex-committer/ &#42; Practically, have
it behave as a different application. First, we could communicate with
it via an API and then via JSON to have it remotely. &#42; Use-cases:
projects behind a firewall, upsteam projects not wanting to give SSH
access, etc. &#42; Work with SELinux a plus.

*Contacts:*

DimitrisGlezos

## Transifex: Server-federated architecture (&#35;tx_federated) {#transifex-server-federated-architecture-tx_federated}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

One of the most important assets of Tx is its community bridging
architecture. When multiple Transifex instances exist, they might want
to share stuff, like users, translation statistics and maybe
submissions. Eg. a Fedora user could submit something to the Debian
server, which will wait the approval of a Debian language leader.

&#42; For a single Tx instance to scale well, one might want to split
its functionality into (say) el.fooTx.org, pt.fooTx.org, etc. &#42; This
splitting/joining requires something like a server to server
architecture/protocol and the ability to aggregate and delegate stuff on
both sides &#42; Some projects might want to have their own Tx instance
which contains internal projects, not publicly visible. At the same
time, they might have public projects wanting to freely receive
translations, but also they might want to allow their internal
translators to use this instance as a gateway to all other Tx servers.
&#42; Minimizing the independence between the scattered Tx instances
(ie. building bridges between the Tx \'islands\') will bring the whole
\'community bridging\' idea of Transifex to a whole new level. This is
the goal we want to reach in the long term.

The most important aspect of this idea is architecture design. The
student will need to have a very good image of content and translation
workflow, the process Transifex adopts, and study how open source
projects work together.

Also, most likely the student will want to discuss a lot with the main
Transifex developers. Fluent English is probably an important asset for
someone applying for this idea.

## Transifex: Usability and efficiency enhancements (&#35;tx_enhancement) {#transifex-usability-and-efficiency-enhancements-tx_enhancement}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Currently our application to submit translations (Transifex) doesn't
have i18n support for translators to be able to translate it. Definitely
it is a thing than we have to do. The admin face of transifex needs some
enhancements. Currently we just have the option to add modules and
repos, but we can't handle them with edit or remove options. All
interactions with the user over the application could be quicker and
more efficient using Ajax calls mainly with JSON. It could improve the
user experience and make a great application improvement for all
translators.

*Contacts:*

DiegoZacarao, DimitrisGlezos

*Notes:*

&#42; Add i18n support. &#42; Add user friendly interface to handle
modules and repos. &#42; Should we merge the two modules lists of
t.fp.o? &#42; Make all relevant interactions of application be called
using Ajax.

PS: The idea is based on what I'm able to work on.

## Transifex: Online editing, integration of Pootle (&#35;tx_pootle) {#transifex-online-editing-integration-of-pootle-tx_pootle}

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

Currently, translators have to manually download PO files from outside
of Transifex, change them, then use Transifex to submit these changed
files to a project's repository. It would lower the bar of entry quite a
bit if they could edit the translations, one at a time (i.e.: not the
complete PO file, but individual messages), directly in Transifex. With
[Pootle](http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/index) , there is
a web-based PO file editor which could be integrated with Transifex.

The work proposed here involves getting Pootle and Transifex working
together, in a way that Pootle uses Transifex to handle and submit
files. The idea is that we have a community that already uses a workflow
around traditional, VCS-centric translations, which would like to use a
web-based translation for some modules. Here are some details about what
could be done:

&#42; Add necessary configuration options in Pootle to use Transifex for
certain tasks and particular modules. &#42; Abstract what is needed to
retain compatibility with the traditional way of handling files in
Pootle. &#42; Extend Transifex in a way that accepts submissions without
the web interface (might need some discussion with the student working
on the Command Line Interface).

*Contacts:*

NilsPhilippsen, DimitrisGlezos

*Notes:*

&#42; Edit translations directly in Transifex (or in a seamless,
integrated way with Tx), operating on individual messages. &#42; Compare
pootle to locally running PO editors (e.g. kbabel, gtranslator, poedit),
check if essential functionality is missing and eventually implement it
(e.g. does it display eventually included source code comments which
help translating the message, cf. \'xgettext \--add-comments &#8230;\').
&#42; Evaluate whether certain Pootle functionality (e.g. translation
suggestions) is needed or can be disabled for Transifex.

## Smolt: Pretty Web 2.0 Interfaces

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:*

smolts.org stores alot of information already. Getting the information
out to the public in the way that is useful to people is hard. There is
a number of ways this can be done, and we've discussed many. We are
looking for someone who is interested in finding out ways to tell people
more about their own computer.

The Smolt program collects statistics about hardware running Linux and
other data that goes with it. It collects lists of hardware devices,
type of CPU, hard drive information and other statistics for each
machine. While we can deliver statistics that are useful as fun
factoids, they do not help out people looking for detailed information.
This also does not inform people about any known issues about their
machine. Two classic examples of what we are looking for are these:

&#42; Joe wants to know how many machines running Fedora 9 Betas have
SELinux enabled &#42; Fred needs to know that there is new eratta for
his soundcard, perhaps we can make sound work on his new machine
finally! &#42; Tim's machine works perfectly, how can he tell us this,
so that we can mark our stamp of approval

These are only guidelines of the things we are looking for. This project
is very open ended, and you can do what you feel like. New Ideas are
very welcome. You will work concurrently with one or two other
developers who will work on parallel ideas, so you will not be
completely on your own.

You will need only some basic web skills and a basic understanding of
data structures. This project is based on implementing whiz-bang ideas,
and not on using technology X. Smolt is based off of Turbogears,
SQLAlchemy, and MySQL. Basic experience in any of these technologies, or
just Python is a plus..

*Contacts:*

&#42; YaakovNemoy &#42; MikeMcGrath

*Notes:*

&#42; Create a good web interface to access data from the server &#42;
Make Smolt more helpful to the end user &#42; If you like buzzwords,
this project is very Web 2.0 oriented.

## Election Software

*Status:* *Proposed*

*Summary of idea:* Currently, our election software can only handle one
groups (FESCo, FAB, etc.) election at the time. We would like to see it
modified to handle multiple groups at a time.

*Contacts:* ToshioKuratomi, BrianPepple

*Notes:* The current software we're using resides at
<http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewcvs/fedora-vote/?root=fedora>

If there is enough time during the GSoC, we would advocate rewriting
this software as a TurboGears app. This will make it 1) fit into our
existing infrastructure (auth will be very easy, for instance). 2) Make
it more extensible. So we could add history view of past elections,
on-the-fly updates of how the vote is going, etc.

## Spin chooser

*Status:* *Proposed*

\'\'Summary of idea: In this idea spins can be chosen while installing
fedora. If somebody has downloaded a dvd or a cd he can chose the a
predefined group of packages defined in the package chooser such as
choosing gamer will install all games and utilitiess available in the
dvd and the rest from internet. This would save people time as they
won't have to select apps one by one in the package chooser \'\'

    === What's GCI?

    Google Code-in (GCI) is an annual programming competition hosted by Google Inc. that allows pre-university students to complete tasks specified by various, partnering open source organizations.The contest was originally the Google Highly Open Participation Contest, but in 2010, the format was modified into its current state.Students that complete tasks win certificates and T-shirts.Each organization also selects two grand prize award winners who will earn a trip to Google's Headquarters located in Mountain View, California.


    === Task Themes

    A wide variety of bite-sized tasks for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they have.
    One can find this https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/example-tasks[list] for inspiration.

    [[why-work-with-fedora]]
    === Why work with Fedora?

    Our project is large and diverse.
    We are very experienced at working with new contributors and helping them be successful.

    Many of our contributors are long-time contributors.
    They remain because they want to keep growing the project and to lend their expertise, advice and mentoring to you!
    People who stay around the community and do good work are noticed.
    As a long-standing community with many facets, it is possible for you to find many rewarding sub-projects to work on.

    This has the answers to your questions and tells you how to apply\&#42;\&#42;

    Do not hesitate to contact the mentors or org admins listed on this page for any questions or clarification.

    == Org Admins and Mentors

    The following contributors are available to provide general help and
    support for the GSoD program.

    \&#42; link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/user/Pbokoc[Petr Bokoč]: Professional Technical Writer with Red Hat focused on Fedora and other community documentation.

    == Idea list
    The list is subjected to changes as the program proceeds.

    \&#42; Refactor the Fedora Installation Guide to provide an improved user experience or a more accessible information architecture.
    This document could be split by Edition (Workstation, Server, etc.) to focus on the needs of that target audience.
    Text should be shared where possible to make ongoing maintenance easier.

    \&#42; Update and republish our old Network Guide (and other guides) that haven’t been updated for the latest releases.
    These guides are currently unpublished and need some love.

    \&#42; Review, update and add new Quick Docs documentation at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/.

    \&#42; Consolidate and update the various Documentation Contributor Guides to reflect our latest infrastructure for publishing and submission.

    \&#42; Update and enhance current contributor documentation, including developing ASCIIDoc markup guidelines and providing a set of ASCIIDoc snippets for common text editors (Atom, Vim, Emacs, Gedit).

    \&#42; Create a documentation set aimed at users completely new to Linux and Fedora in particular, focusing on describing alternatives to software commonly used on other operating systems (such as web browsers, productivity suites, video/music players, image/video editing software…), and concepts such as package management and updates.

    \&#42; Write new content, explaining certain aspects of how NetworkManager works. In particular, a high level overview of how NetworkManager works and \&#96;howtos\&#96;.
    \&#42; Reorganize and restructure the content on our Github Pages and Documentation
    \&#42;\&#42; Better link to useful resources (e.g. distributions specific NetworkManager pages, our documentation, or useful blog articles).
    \&#42; Our manual pages are maintained along with NetworkManager’s source code.
    \&#42;\&#42; Several of these manual pages are written in \&#96;docbook\&#96;. They are fine in principle, but could benefit from review and improvements.
    \&#42;\&#42; New manual pages should be added. For example to describe \&#96;“nm-cloud-setup”\&#96; tool or \&#96;“NetworkManager-wait-online”\&#96;. Also, dispatcher scripts are currently described in \&#96;“man NetworkManager”\&#96;. This should get its own manual page \&#96;“NetworkManager-dispatcher”\&#96;.
    \&#42; The \&#96;“nm-settings”\&#96; manual page is generated, mostly based on \&#96;gtk-doc\&#96; comments using self-written scripts. We currently have the manuals \&#96;“nm-settings”\&#96;, \&#96;“nm-settings-keyfile”\&#96; and \&#96;“nm-settings-ifcfg-rh”\&#96;, which cover different aspects of the properties that can be configured in a \&#96;NetworkManager\&#96; profile. In reality, there are really 4 aspects (which are related and often similar):
    \&#42;\&#42; \&#96;dbus\&#96;: how is the setting encoded on D-Bus (man nm-settings)
    \&#42;\&#42; \&#96;nmcli\&#96;: how is this setting represented in nmcli (partly documented in man nmcli)
    \&#42;\&#42; \&#96;keyfile\&#96;: how is the setting persisted in keyfile format (man nm-settings-keyfile)
    \&#42;\&#42; \&#96;Ifcfg-rh\&#96;: how is the setting persisted in ifcfg-rh format (man nm-settings-ifcfg-rh)
    \&#42; This should be better structured by having 4 manual pages “nm-settings-dbus”, “nm-settings-nmcli”, “nm-settings-keyfile”, and “nm-settings-ifcfg-rh”. This requires changes to the tooling so that we generate more suitable manuals. It also requires adjustment of the documentation, so that it fits the aspects better.
    \&#42; The D-Bus API reference gets generated from the introspection D-Bus description in XML. This is probably the part that requires the least amount of work, but should also be reviewed whether there can be anything improved.
    \&#42; Improve NetworkManager’s README file in our git as this is also a good starting point for contributors.

    | Nmstate | \&#42; Fernando Fernando Mancera (ferferna@redhat.com)
    \&#42; Till Maas (till@redhat.com)| \&#42; Nmstate’s documentation currently does not contain a getting started guide. We’d like the technical writer to create a complete guide on how to start using nmstate.
    \&#42;\&#42; Create detailed usage examples using the different features that nmstare supports

    \&#42;\&#42; The current link:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32/install-guide/[Fedora Installation Guide], while adequate, has been converted from a different publishing toolchain a few years ago and never updated to take advantage of the new, modular toolchain, Antora, that the Fedora Documentation Project currently uses. Additionally, parts of the Installation Guide are also being used inside the graphical installer to provide built-in help, however, at present time the installer is forced to use old, pre-conversion sources.
    +
    We would like to fix all issues described above. A writer working on this project would be expected to:
    +
    \&#42;\&#42; Modularize the guide so that it functions as a set of standalone modules and leverages the advantages of Antora, instead of the current hierarchical structure. This involves restructing the source file structure and updating all internal references (xrefs).
    +
    \&#42;\&#42; Work with the installer development team to ensure that the Installation Guide can be used as sources for the installer built-in help. People both in the Fedora Documentation Project as well as in the installer development team have prior experience with doing this, and will be able to provide help.

    \&#42; Develop a set of documentation showcasing Fedora's features
    +
    \&#42;\&#42; Fedora Documentation is missing a set of docs aimed at people considering switching to Linux and Fedora in particular from other operating systems, notably MS Windows. We would like to create documentation that showcases Fedora's features relevant to a home user's general use cases, such as web browsing, multimedia creation and editing, video playback, etc.
    +
    \&#42;\&#42; A writer working on creating such a doc set would be expected to work with various stakeholders in the Fedora Project such as the Mindshare Committee and project leadership, identify personas and their specific use cases, and then create documentation covering these use cases.

    Fedora documentation is written using the link:http://asciidoc.org/[ASCIIDoc markup language]. Sources are stored in git, and they are published using link:https://antora.org/[Antora]. Familiarity with any of these tools, as well as basic scripting, is preferred but not necessary.

    === Why spend your summer working on FOSS?

    When you work in the open on free software, you create a body of work
    that follows you for the rest of your life. Rather than a coding
    assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the
    bottom of the drawer at semester's end, working in FOSS is a chance to
    contribute to a living project.

    Working in FOSS gives you a chance to:

    \&#42; Work with real-world, large codebases.
    \&#42; Collaborate with real engineers and other professionals.
    \&#42; Contribute to something meaningful while learning and earning.
    \&#42; Learn tools and processes that are just like what you are going to use
    if you work in technology after graduation.
    \&#42; Make friends and contacts around the globe.
    \&#42; Attract attention that can lead to an internship or job after
    graduation.
    \&#42; Create lifetime connections and associations.

    If you are new to the Fedora Project, the following material will help
    you to get started.

    === Student Responsibilities

    You are the key ingredient for your project's success. This project is
    important to you, your mentor, and the entire Fedora Community.

    Your responsibilities include:

    \&#42; Communicating early and often with your mentor.
    \&#42; Blogging every week about what you're learning, how you're doing,
    challenges and successes. This is key way to keep the entire Fedora
    Community informed.
    \&#42; Working with your mentor on realistic achievable milestones that
    provide for regular deliverables and feedback.
    \&#42; Attending the brief student calls, as announced
    \&#42; Being accountable for your success and your actions

    === mentor-information

    NOTE: If you are contacted directly by a student, we encourage you
    to reply and include the mailing list and/or IRC channel to keep the
    process transparent and to ensure the inquiry is able to be answered by
    more people than just you.

    === How to Propose a Project

    If you want to mentor a specific project, think carefully about several things:

    1. Do you have enough time to work on this with the student during the
    entire project.  You will be helping someone else when they get stuck.
    You don't want to become a blocker because you're busy.

    2. It is harder to find success when you are completely certain of how an
    idea needs to be implemented; finding a student with the skills and
    interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than finding
    a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need. Also,
    students learn more when they help design and guide the project. In
    other words, provide guidance and direction but let the student do
    some of the 'driving.'

    3. Where you can have looser ideas, you may be able to find a student
    who works as a sort-of intern who can implement a solution to a use
    case you have. In past experiences, students going after a use case are
    more likely to get somewhere with self-direction and support from you.

    4. Who can help you?  Try to find a second mentor for the project.

    If you're interested in working with a student on a specific project you should post your idea to the https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues[Mentored Projects Issue Tracker].  Your issue should be tagged \&#42;Outreachy\&#42; and use the \&#42;Outreachy - Proposed Project\&#42; template.  We strongly encourage you to find a second person to help with mentoring and to solicit feedback on your proposal


    === Can I be a Mentor Without a Project?

    Yes!  You can either:

    \&#42; Work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project. This
    requires a different level of communication throughout the project,
    but can be the most rewarding.

    \&#42; Be a general mentor.  This is a person who works with all students
    regardless of their project.  To become a general mentor please open
    an issue in the https://pagure.io/mentored-projects/issues[Mentored
    Projects Issue Tracker] offering your help.  Please tag the issue with
    the \&#42;Outreachy\&#42; tag.

    === mentor-responsibilities

    You are an essential part of the student's success, the project's
    success, and the success for the Fedora Project.

    Your responsibilities include:

    \&#42; Being an interface for an identified sub-project or SIG in Fedora.
    \&#42; Helping students communicate with the overall project and any
    upstream.
    \&#42; Helping the student plan realistic achievable milestones that provide
    for regular deliverables and feedback.
    \&#42; Regular communication with your student. This means you must be
    regularly available for the entire project. If you take a holiday you
    need to know early and help your student be ready for your brief
    absence.
    \&#42; Attending a brief mentors call, as scheduled.
    \&#42; Be the final, accountable person for deciding if the student is
    successful or not. This is responsibility akin to being a professor or
    boss.

    \&#42; \&lt;\&lt;Create a GraphQL API for Bodhi\&gt;\&gt;
    \&#42; \&lt;\&lt;Fedora Badges Back-end Engineering\&gt;\&gt;
    \&#42; \&lt;\&lt;Fedora Design Internship\&gt;\&gt;

    === Create a GraphQL API for Bodhi

    The current implementation of Bodhi REST API is far from being ideal. The REST endpoints are not following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and there are doing a lot of magic making it difficult to use by someone not familiar with the Bodhi code base. The Goal of this project is to give Bodhi a /graphql endpoint which would allow users to use grapqhl to query bodhi resources.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    Week 1-4:
    \&#42; Update the development environment with the python graphene library
    \&#42; Add a new graphql service which routes to /graphql and returns a simple string 'Hello World'
    \&#42; Write tests for that service.
    \&#42; Integrate graphene to the graphql service. The /graphql endpoints should now accept a graphql query and return the same simple string 'Hello World'.
    \&#42; Update the tests
    \&#42; Update environment and dependencies to introduce graphene-sqlalchemy.
    \&#42; Use the graphene sqlalchemy library to generate the graphql schema for the Release class.
    \&#42; Add a graphql query handler for the Releases.

    Week 5-12:
    \&#42; Work and Desing the graphql schema. Analyse the dependencies between the different object and how this will be reflected in the graphql tree.
    \&#42; I don't expect much coding during this week, this should be used as a foundation for the following work.
    \&#42; Implement the graphql schema. Focusing first on the queries since this does not require any authentication.
    \&#42; Users should be able to query for releases, updates, builds, overrides, packages, users, comments.
    \&#42; If times allow then we can look at the implementation of the mutation (creating, updating resources). The first step to this is to have authentication and authorization in place.

    ===  Fedora Badges Back-end Engineering

    Fedora Badges is a fun website built to recognize contributors to Fedora, help
    new and existing Fedora contributors find different ways to get involved, and
    encourage the improvement of Fedora's infrastructure.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    Week 1-3:
    \&#42; Research badgr-server / create development environment
    \&#42; Add a test badge
    \&#42; FAS integration (see Sign-In Configuration)
    \&#42; Locally in dev environment
    \&#42; https://iddev.fedorainfracloud.org

    Week 4-7:
    \&#42; Containerizing badgr-server for Communishift (see PR \&#35;110, PR \&#35;212)
    \&#42; python/django
    \&#42; mysql
    \&#42; memcached
    \&#42; amqp broker (e.g. RabbitMQ)
    \&#42; [research] Figuring out the best way to align local development practices with production deployment (docker-compose? minishift?)
    \&#42; Migrate old badges data to new database (postgresql -\&gt; mysql)

    Week 7-9:
    \&#42; Migrate old badges data to new database (postgresql -\&gt; mysql)
    \&#42; Fedora-messaging middleware
    \&#42; Python?
    \&#42; Writing unit tests with Pytest
    \&#42; Containerization / running in communityshift
    \&#42; Deployment documentation, SOP (!!!)
    \&#42; How to add a new badge
    \&#42; How to upgrade the version

    Week 10-12:
    \&#42; Fedora-messaging middleware

    ===  Fedora Design Internship
    The Fedora Design Team is Fedora's in-house design agency. We provide artwork,
    user experience, usability, and general design services to the Fedora project.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    Week 1-4:
    \&#42; Draft Fedora Budget Quarterly and Yearly Reports designs
    \&#42; Incorporate feedback into budget designs and complete. Begin to solicit and gather information from teams on accomplishments made in 2019.
    \&#42; Organize info coming in from teams. Begin drafting infographics to highlight these accomplishments. Begin to solicit artwork, designs, photography, content, for Fedora Zine.
    \&#42; Start working on a handout for events specified by Contributor Recruitment Initiative. Refine infographics for team accomplishments, continue to solicit info/gather/organize.

    Week 5-8:
    \&#42; Incorporate feedback into handout for CRI. Complete infographics for team accomplishments.
    \&#42; Begin drafting Fedora Zine, using a lot of the same team accomplishments that have been gathered already and assets that have been solicited.
    \&#42; Incorporate feedback into Fedora Zine. Start working on assets for Flock 2020: game night stickers/handouts, tshirt, badges, and whatever else is left to do.
    \&#42; Incorporate feedback into Fedora Zine. Incorporate feedback into Flock assets. Start picking up Fedora Badges tickets to get familiar with the aesthetic.

    Week 9-12:
    \&#42; Identify all the Fedora Badges that need to be reviewed/improved. Finalize Flock assets.
    \&#42; Final push to finalize Fedora Zine. Familiarize yourself with Fedora Badges Style guide. Work on badges that have been identified as needing improvement.
    \&#42; Identify and document things that need to be updated in the style guide, begin to incorporate them into an updated draft. Work on badge designs that need improvement/new ideas.
    \&#42; Incorporate improvements and finalize new version of Badges style Guide. Finalize any leftover designs/projects/follow ups that need to be done.

    === Improve Fedora QA Dashboard

    Back to \&lt;\&lt;Idea list\&gt;\&gt;

    Fedora QA dashboard is an idea of a web application that would be the landing page for QA related activities. The current state, as we see it, is that we have tons of helpful documents, tools, and processes, but these are scattered, or sometimes hard to reach/understand without some preliminary knowledge. We identified this as the major obstacle in bootstrapping new members of the community. Goal for this project is making the learning curve less steep. We have basic PoC, that could serve as a base to build from, or an inspiration for a rework.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    . \&#42;\&#42;Week 1\&#42;\&#42;
    \&#42; Create final design from provided mock up ideas

    === Improve Fedora\'s automated community metrics

    Back to \&lt;\&lt;Idea list\&gt;\&gt;

    Many activities in Fedora generate activity on the Fedora Message bus. (More about this here: https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/moving-from-fedmsg-to-fedora-messaging/). These messages can be used to measure and graph community engagement.

    Rudimentary Python code to do this is at: https://pagure.io/fedora-contributor-trends

    I have used this data in talks (https://mattdm.org/fedora/2016devconf/) and to help inform project decision making. I also have a weekly-updated version here: https://mattdm.org/fedora/fedora-contributor-trends/.

    This project would be to improve and update this code in up to six different ways:

    1. As outlined in the blog post above, the Fedora Message bus is in the midst of transitioning to new technology, which may make the way the current script gets data obsolete. See https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6NRUH7EP6ERTBUEVTTXYLA25QUSHTKBE/ for possible plans. The upside is that some of the new options could be much better; the current code hits the server very hard.
    2. The code really is hacky and ugly. It could use refactoring and beautification.
    3. There are some data sources we're not using and could be: there are messages from pagure and will be ones from discourse that would be excellent candidates.
    4. The visualizations I created for my presentation in 2016 are nice, but there are many other ways to look at the data. Come up with new ways to look at it which may show more insights.
    5. Find an official place for this to run rather than on mattdm's personal server.
    6. Simply put, the graphs and reports could be prettier.

    Completion of all six is not necessary for project success. An applicant could choose to focus on two or three of these and that would still be hugely beneficial.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    \&#42; Make the graphs and reports pretty

    === Support repo overrides in rpm-ostree

    Back to \&lt;\&lt;Idea list\&gt;\&gt;

    Today, rpm-ostree support overrides from locally downloaded RPM files. For example:

    \&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
    rpm-ostree override replace kernel.rpm
    \&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

    This works great, but is limiting. There are many situations where one would rather have an RPM override from yum repos, the same way one would usually simply yum install on a traditional system.

    We want to teach rpm-ostree this ability. The command-line UX would be similar, for example:

    \&#96;\&#96;\&#96;
    rpm-ostree override replace kernel
    \&#96;\&#96;\&#96;

    Except that rpm-ostree would look for the specified package(s) in enabled yum repos.

    ==== Sample plan of work for the 12 week internship.

    . \&#42;\&#42;Week 1-2\&#42;\&#42;:
    \&#42; Ramp up and set up developer environment.
    . \&#42;\&#42;Week 3-4\&#42;\&#42;:
    \&#42; Finalize approach of implementation.
    . \&#42;\&#42;Week 5-9\&#42;\&#42;:
    \&#42; Work on implementation, iterate based on feedback from mentors.
    . \&#42;\&#42;Week 10-12\&#42;\&#42;:
    \&#42; Stretch goals based on interest. Some ideas include better overrides integration with COPR, Bodhi, and/or Koji, and writing a fedmag blog post about the new feature.Week 1-2: Ramp up and set up developer environment.

    Yes, absolutely.Collaboration with the Design Team and other applicants is encouraged.

    6. \&#42;\&#42;How can I find Fedora design materials to work with?\&#42;\&#42; +
    There are a couple places you can find Fedora design materials.The link:https://pagure.io/design/issues[fedora-design] repo on Pagure contains a lot of historical work.There is a dropdown on the left hand side that says 'XX Open Issues', click that dropdown and set to 'XX Open \&amp; Closed Issues' to see a complete list of tickets.You can then search under the 'Filter' dropdown.The same applies to the https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues[fedora-badges] repo on Pagure.

    7. \&#42;\&#42;How many tickets should I work on at the same time?\&#42;\&#42;
    - Fedora Design Internship: Please limit yourself to 2 design queue tickets. You can work on a third if it is a Fedora Badges ticket. Although we appreciate the enthusiasm of our applicants, we also only have a certain capacity to provide reviews. This helps to ensure that applicants are receiving reviews equally and at regular intervals.
    - Fedora Badges Internship: Please limit yourself to 3 badge queue tickets. Once you complete a ticket, you are welcome to take up another.

    8. \&#42;\&#42;Some of the source file links on the Design \&amp; Pages repo gives me an error. What should I do?\&#42;\&#42;
    This is a known error with Pagure caused by a migration from Trac to Pagure. But, no worries! There is a fix. Files that have that issue will look like this, with two identical comments.

    image::outreachy_FAQ_1.png[float='right']
    One of the links for the image files will give you the following error page. This link is no longer good.

    image::outreachy_FAQ_2.png[float='right']
    You will see a second comment with another link with the same file name, and it should give you this error page. This is the one we want to work with. Simply remove “files/” from the URL and hit enter.

    The purpose of this page is to introduce you to the essential, basic tools that all Fedora interns and mentors commonly use.
    Some of these are universal and you will absolutely encounter as a Fedora intern.
    Other tools will be used at varying levels depending on your specific project and mentor.
    Use this as a place to get started with setting up your Fedora toolbox.

    [[fas]]
    == Fedora Accounts System (FAS)

    The Fedora Account System, or FAS for short, is the underpinning of all the digital infrastructure in Fedora.
    Think of it like your passport to start your Fedora adventure.
    If you have not yet created an account, do so now. Once your account is created, complete the following steps:

    . \&#42;Fill your profile out completely\&#42;.
    Name, Matrix ID, time zone, GitHub/GitLab usernames, etc.
    If you have SSH or GPG keys, you can also add them.
    . \&#42;Set a profile picture using https://www.libravatar.org/[Libravatar]\&#42;.
    Log in with the https://www.libravatar.org/openid/login/[OpenID option].
    To log in with OpenID, use the following identifier below in the Libravatar login page.
    You will be redirected to a FAS login screen. Add and confirm your personal email once you log in.
    .. \&#96;my-username.id.fedoraproject.org\&#96; (example: \&#96;jflory7.id.fedoraproject.org\&#96;)
    . \&#42;Sign the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement\&#42;.
    You can find this in the Agreements tab of the Settings menu.
    Ask a mentor if you have questions about the agreement and what it means for your contributions.


    [[wiki]]
    == Fedora Wiki

    The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Project_Wiki[Fedora Wiki] is a common tool used for collaboration.
    Think of it as a whiteboard space for scratch notes or for short-term documentation.
    We often use the Fedora Wiki as a planning tool for virtual events, like the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux_40_Release_Party_Schedule[F40 Release Party wiki page].

    However, \&#42;first, you need to create your userpage\&#42;.
    Wiki userpages are like biography pages to know more about a Fedora contributor.
    This is a good place to be more detailed about your background, what you do in Fedora, and how people can get in touch with you.
    See an example userpage https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jflory7[here].
    You will need to write your userpage using https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting[MediaWiki markup].
    Create your userpage by clicking on your username in the dropdown menu after logging in (see below).

    image:ROOT:handbooks/interns-wiki-userpage.png[tmp]


    [[gitlab]]
    == GitLab

    https://gitlab.com/[GitLab.com] is a common tool used to track tasks, update progress, and plan future work.
    Check with your mentor if you will use GitLab.com regularly during your internship.
    If you have not already, create a GitLab.com account.
    Once you have a GitLab account, link your FAS account to GitLab using ✨ https://gitlab.com/groups/fedora/-/saml/sso[this magic link] ✨.

    [IMPORTANT]
    ====
    Sign in to GitLab FIRST before linking your FAS account with the magic link.
    If you are not logged into GitLab.com and link your FAS account, you will end up with two accounts.
    It is not easy to merge two accounts into one later.
    ====


    [[chat]]
    == Fedora Chat

    https://chat.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Chat] is our primary chat tool used in Fedora.
    Fedora Chat is a hosted Matrix homeserver linked to FAS logins.
    However, if you already have a Matrix account, you can use your own Matrix account without creating a Fedora-specific Matrix account.
    It is up to you whether you want to use a Fedora-hosted Matrix account or use an account hosted somewhere else.
    You can use a \&#96;:matrix.org\&#96; account and use features in the Element X client, which is not currently supported with Fedora-hosted Matrix accounts.
    However, sometimes people prefer to use a Fedora-hosted Matrix account to keep work and personal activities separate.

    \&#42;If you want a Fedora-hosted Matrix account\&#42;:
    Use FAS to create an account at https://chat.fedoraproject.org[chat.fedoraproject.org].
    Let a mentor know once you have an account so you can be invited to any rooms needed for the internship.

    \&#42;If you are using another Matrix account\&#42;:
    Join the Fedora Space at (https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org]) if you are not already a member.
    Ask your mentor(s) to invite you to any internship-specific rooms, if you are not yet invited.


    [[discussion]]
    == Fedora Discussion

    https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Discussion] is an online web forum powered by a tool called Discourse.
    Create an account and https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/my/preferences/profile[fill in your profile].
    Write a self-introduction in the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tags/c/project/7/mentored-projects-team[Fedora Mentored PRojects tag].

    // Article content last reviewed and verified by a human on…
    2024-07-16

    Congratulations on being accepted as an intern with Fedora!
    You are now a part of a vibrant community and an integral part of advancing free and open source software.
    This handbook is designed to be your guide, helping you navigate your role, responsibilities and the community at large.

    In Fedora, a project doesn’t exist in isolation.
    It is a part of a big ecosystem that thrives on the collaboration between numerous community members, who bring a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to the table.
    Your role extends beyond the specific tasks of your project.
    As you immerse yourself in your project, remember the bigger picture: each contribution you make enriches the Fedora ecosystem, and by extension, the wider world of open source.


    [[started]]
    == Getting Started

    Here are some suggestions on how you can set yourself up for a successful internship:

    [[hello]]
    === Hello world!

    It is always nice to introduce yourself to the Fedora community.
    Introduce yourself as the project intern on Fedora Discussion, Fedora Chat, and the appropriate mailing lists.

    Not sure how to introduce yourself?
    Here is a good place to start:

    \&#42; Name, location/time zone, any prior open source or Linux experience
    \&#42; Something you are excited to do or support during your internship
    \&#42; Something you are looking forward to learning more about during your internship
    \&#42; Where to get in touch with you in Fedora's communication platforms (e.g. Discussion, Matrix, email, etc.)

    [[adapting]]
    === Adapting to Open Source Culture

    Open source has a very unique culture, that is different from a more corporate structure that many interns often expect.
    You can talk to your mentor to learn the norms and expectations of the open-source community to help you acclimatize better, including how to respectfully contribute to discussions, submit work, and respect the community guidelines.
    Familiarizing yourself with the ways to receive and provide constructive feedback within your project team and the wider community is also an essential skill for both personal and professional growth.

    [[tools]]
    === Tools of the Trade

    There are some tools that we often use in Fedora for account management, documentation, project management, and communication.
    In a remote setup like this, we rely on these tools a lot, so it is important that you familiarize yourself with these tools.
    You can find a xref:tools.adoc[comprehensive documentation here].

    [[rhythm]]
    === Establish a rhythm with your mentors!

    Mentorship is a key ingredient for a successful internship.
    Think of your mentor as your personal guide in the community: someone who’s been there, done that, and probably got a T-Shirt for it.
    Here’s how to make the most of it:

    \&#42; \&#42;Schedule regular check-ins\&#42;:
    Work with your mentor to schedule regular meetings that work for everyone’s time zones.
    \&#42; \&#42;Prepare for your meetings\&#42;:
    Joining your mentor meetings without preparation is like going to a potluck without a dish.
    You might get some goodies, but you will not be contributing much to the feast.
    Come prepared with updates, questions, and topics you want advice on.
    \&#42; \&#42;Be open and honest\&#42;:
    Transparency with your mentor is key.
    Struggling with a bug, feeling overwhelmed, or something isn’t working?
    Bring it up.
    Do not think of your mentor as your manager, but rather as your ally, there to support you in your open source journey.
    \&#42; \&#42;Give and take feedback\&#42;:
    Feedback is the breakfast of champions!
    Be receptive to feedback, even if it is not always what you want to hear.
    And do not forget to give your mentor feedback.
    They will also appreciate knowing what works and what does not.
    \&#42; \&#42;Celebrate wins together\&#42;:
    Do not forget to celebrate your wins, no matter how small.
    Your mentor is your cheerleader, ready with a virtual high-five for every victory.


    [[making]]
    == Making the most of your internship

    Work with your mentor to set clear, achievable goals.
    You can use frameworks like SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound - to help you.
    Regularly review and adjust these goals.

    [[goals]]
    === Setting goals

    Networking is an important part of career growth.
    We encourage you to engage with the broader Fedora community through forums, mailing lists and various events.
    You can also ask your mentor to support you and make introductions.

    [[career]]
    === Career development

    Your internship will focus on a specific project(s) and tasks.
    However, internships are also learning opportunities for you to grow and develop in your career.
    Outside of project work, your mentor(s) plays an important role in supporting you in your development goals and skill development.
    As you start your internship, reflect on areas that you would like to grow and develop in.
    Are there technical skills that you would like to improve?
    Do you want to learn more about git, a programming language, or a particular framework?
    What about soft skills?
    Are you confident in delivering a presentation and collaborating with a diverse group of stakeholders across multiple teams?
    These are good questions to reflect on, and ultimately can only be answered by you!

    Work your mentor as a partner in your career development goals, and make sure you communicate these development goals to your mentor, so that you can partner on them together and have a successful internship that both contributes to your specific project and also strengthens your portfolio as a working professional in the open source space.

    [[reflect]]
    === Reflect and share

    Document your journey and share it through blog posts or talks, and contribute back to the community.
    Reflecting on your experiences can provide valuable insights for future interns.
    Here are some examples of works like this by past interns:

    \&#42; https://rolandixor.pro/blog/2024/04/outreachy-internship[Outreachy Internship] by Roland Taylor (@rolandxior)
    \&#42; https://smera.notion.site/Outreachy-The-Fedora-Project-6919e20d745f4b18850200909f190c0b[Outreachy: The Fedora Project] by Smera Goel (@smeragoel)

    Outreachy encourages blogging as a way to do this, providing specific prompts to guide your posts.
    These blog posts not only document your journey, but also connect you with the broader open source community.
    They are also helpful for future applicants, just like you may have come across when you were an applicant.
    For more details on the blogging schedule and prompts, you can refer to the Outreachy Internship Guide.

    [[events]]
    === Fedora Events

    Ask your mentor about upcoming events and meetings.
    Participating in these gatherings, whether online or in-person, can enhance your understanding of the project and expand your professional network as well.


    [[beyond]]
    == Beyond the Internship \&amp; Continuing Contributions

    It is always a bittersweet experience when your internship ends, but the good thing about open source is that you can always stick around.
    Many interns continue to contribute as community members, mentors and project leaders.
    Talk with your mentor about how you can stay involved and continue to be a part of the community!

    [[offboarding]]
    === Off-boarding best practices

    For an effective off-boarding process:

    \&#42; \&#42;Document Everything\&#42;:
    Ensure all work, including code and processes, is thoroughly documented.
    \&#42; \&#42;Feedback\&#42;:
    Share feedback with your mentor and team to discuss improvements and your overall internship experience
    \&#42; \&#42;Network\&#42;:
    Keep contact details for team members and plan to stay connected through professional networks.
    \&#42; \&#42;Files and deliverables\&#42;:
    Make sure all files and deliverables are shared with your mentor.

    Welcome to the Fedora Project Mentor Handbook, a guide designed to equip mentors with the tools, resources, and best practices needed to support contributors within the Fedora community.
    Whether you're an experienced contributor looking to give back or a newcomer eager to support others on their journey, this handbook will provide you with the knowledge and strategies needed for your mentorship role.

    [[understanding]]
    == Understanding Mentorship

    Becoming a mentor implies taking on additional responsibilities within your organization instead of reducing your workload.
    It's crucial for the organization to understand that mentees are typically inexperienced contributors who may require support and direction to effectively accomplish their tasks.
    As a mentor, you'll be investing time and effort into guiding these individuals, helping them navigate challenges, and empowering them to grow within the organization.
    This commitment to mentorship not only benefits the mentees but also contributes to the overall success and sustainability of the organization by fostering a culture of learning and development.

    [[communication]]
    === Communication and culture tips

    \&#42;Open Communication:\&#42;

    \&#42; Encourage transparent and respectful communication between mentors and mentees.
    \&#42; Actively listen to mentees' perspectives and concerns without interruptions.
    \&#42; Provide constructive feedback that is specific, actionable, and supportive.

    \&#42;Cultural Sensitivity:\&#42;

    \&#42; Respect and celebrate diversity in backgrounds, cultures, and experiences.
    \&#42; Be mindful of language and behaviors that may unintentionally exclude or offend individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
    \&#42; Foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected regardless of cultural differences.

    By prioritizing open communication and cultural sensitivity, mentors can create a welcoming and supportive environment that promotes effective collaboration and growth within the Outreachy program.

    [[started]]
    == Getting Started

    [[quick]]
    === Quick start

    1. Work with your project team to identify a project that can be achieved by a junior contributor in 2-3 months.
    2. Propose your project idea in the Fedora Mentored Projects repository.
    Use the provided issue template.
    3. Receive feedback from Mentored Project coordinators and respond to questions.
    4. If approved by Fedora coordinators:
    Submit your project into the program-specific portal, e.g. Outreachy or GSoC websites.
    5. Begin preparing applicant tasks in advance of the contribution phase start date.

    [[improving]]
    === How is the project improving Fedora?

    To join in, the Fedora Project needs to know how mentorship will help the community and the Project as a whole.
    Understanding these benefits helps us design the program to meet everyone's needs.
    When proposing a project, make sure to address how this project fits in with Fedora’s philosophies.

    [[many]]
    === How many mentors are going to participate?

    Taking part in the program with only one mentor can present challenges, which is why we advise having at least one other person willing to help out.
    The other person can be a co-mentor, general mentor or a team member who understands the project and is willing to cover in case the primary mentor isn’t available, for example, during vacations or unplanned absences.
    Having access to a diverse range of mentors (e.g. different cultures, different time zones, etc.) can provide a broader perspective and offer different areas of expertise.
    This approach not only enhances the mentorship experience but also increases the likelihood of success.

    [[timeline]]
    === What is the timeline expected for the mentees

    Setting a clear timeline for the mentee is important in mentorship.
    When both the mentor and mentee know what to expect and when, they can work better together.
    This helps avoid confusion and makes sure everyone's on the same page.
    Plus, having a timeline lets us see how things are going, figure out what needs improving, and celebrate successes.
    It makes the whole mentorship experience better for everyone involved.

    For Outreachy, applicants are advised to contact a project mentor to propose a timeline for the project.
    This is a question asked to all applicants in their final Outreachy applications.
    Knowing an approximate timeline will make navigating these questions toward the end of the application period easier.

    [[application]]
    == Application Period

    [[onboarding]]
    === Onboarding material

    It's beneficial to have onboarding resources ready for candidates during the application phase.
    These resources will provide guidance on comprehending the project's scope, contributing effectively, locating suitable initial tasks, and communicating with mentors.

    [[mentorship]]
    == Mentorship Period

    [[introductions]]
    === Introductions

    Ask the mentee to introduce themselves in the following places (and any other project-specific places):

    \&#42; https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tags/c/project/7/mentored-projects-team[\&#35;mentored-projects] on Fedora Discussion
    \&#42; https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;commops:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;commops:fedoraproject.org] on Fedora Chat/Matrix
    \&#42; https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;devel:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;devel:fedoraproject.org] on Fedora Chat/Matrix
    \&#42; https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;council:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;council:fedoraproject.org] on Fedora Chat/Matrix
    \&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel@lists.fp.o]

    [[frequency]]
    === Communicating frequency

    \&#42;Regular Check-ins:\&#42;

    \&#42; Plan weekly or bi-weekly meetings to discuss progress and goals.
    \&#42; Adjust frequency based on project needs and mentee preferences.

    \&#42;Availability:\&#42;

    \&#42; Be reachable during agreed-upon working hours.
    \&#42; Respond promptly to messages and emails within a reasonable timeframe.

    \&#42;Ad Hoc Communication:\&#42;

    \&#42; Encourage quick questions or updates via chat or email outside of scheduled meetings.
    \&#42; Stay open to informal check-ins based on mentee needs.

    \&#42;Documentation:\&#42;

    \&#42; Keep notes of discussions and decisions for reference.
    \&#42; Share helpful resources and documentation to support mentee learning and project progress.

    [[wrapping]]
    == Wrapping Up

    [[handling]]
    === Handling over the project

    \&#42; Do not wait until the last day for merging things and getting changes landed.
    \&#42; Try to wrap significant work before the mentee’s last week.
    \&#42; Spend some time with the mentee to review their work, summarize and advocate their accomplishments.
    \&#42; It’s nice to keep in touch with the mentee after the internship ends.
    It can help with contributor retention and also lead to new projects in the future.
    \&#42; Talk to your mentee about their future plans, both project-related or career-related.
    \&#42; Introduce the idea that the mentee can continue contributing to the project after the internship, but they might need to reevaluate how much time and commitment they can give as a volunteer.
    \&#42; Discuss the idea of periodic check-in calls after their internship, e.g. monthly, quarterly, or any other cadence that works best for both parties.

    [[helping]]
    === Helping the mentee to continue contributing

    \&#42; If the project can continue accepting contributions, talk about what continuing on the project might look like.
    \&#42; If the project cannot accept more contributions or is integrated into something larger, talk about what other options there are to contribute to Fedora.
    \&#42; Encourage the mentee to participate in virtual events, like Release Parties, Week of Diversity, Appreciation Week, etc.

    Coordinators play an important role in the facilitation and execution of Fedora Mentored Projects programs.
    Coordinators are the points-of-contact between Fedora community interns and mentors, and administrators of the Mentored Projects programs we participate in.
    Coordinators are responsible for overseeing applications to the programs we participate in, applying to new programs, guiding Fedora mentors to propose projects for the programs, and being a neutral group for conflict resolution during the course of an internship.
    Additionally, coordinators play an important role in promoting and advocating for intern success, with key participation in major Fedora community events like Flock to Fedora and the Fedora Mentor Summit.

    This handbook describes the various key responsibilities of Fedora Mentored Project coordinators and gives more background to how coordinators support intern success in the Fedora community.

    [[guidance-mentors]]
    == Guidance to Fedora mentors proposing projects

    Fedora Mentored Projects coordinators guide Fedora contributors in becoming project mentors and proposing projects for the programs Fedora participates in.
    Coordinators play an important role in reviewing and approving all project proposals in the community, as well as allocating funding for different projects in the community.
    As part of this responsibility, coordinators provide advice and guidance to Fedora community mentors on crafting the perfect proposal proposal for an intern project.

    Coordinators accept project proposals as public issues on the https://gitlab.com/fedora/mentoring/home[Mentoring Working Group Home] repository on GitLab.
    This is the main tool that coordinators should engage and follow up with mentors who propose projects for upcoming Mentored Projects rounds.

    [[build-team]]
    === Build a team around the project

    Before proposing a project, your project needs a team!
    The best Fedora Mentored Projects are ones where there is a wide net of support.
    Although there should be one, individual mentor who is directly responsible for the project and the intern(s), there should be a bigger team that supports the project.
    This way, there is less burden on an individual mentor, in case the mentor needs to take time away from the project, planned or unplanned.
    So, the main ingredient for a successful Fedora Mentored Project is a team to support the project, so the burden is shared beyond one, single person.
    Anyone who has participated in a Fedora Mentored Project program like Outreachy knows it can be a lot to handle on your own!

    [[propose-project]]
    === How to propose a Fedora Mentored Project

    There are a few steps to proposing a Fedora Mentored Project:

    . Mentor(s) propose a project to Fedora Mentored Projects coordinators.
    . Coordinators and invited reviewers review project proposals and give feedback to mentors on their project proposals.
    Mentors have a brief time period to revise their proposals.
    . Coordinators give an approval or rejection of project proposals for an upcoming Fedora Mentored Projects rounds.
    If approved, a project proposal becomes a Fedora Mentored Project and will run in the next round of a program.
    If rejected, a project proposal will not receive an intern allocation but the mentors are invited to submit and apply again in a future round.

    [[proposal-faq]]
    === Common project proposal questions

    Coordinators often consider the following questions when reviewing project proposals from community mentors:

    \&#42; Does the project have adequate staffing?
    \&#42; Are there enough tasks for the intern to do?
    \&#42; Is there too much for an intern to do?
    \&#42; What formal and informal mentors are available to the intern?
    \&#42; Is there a high probability of the internship deliverables being deployed and/or used in the community?
    \&#42; What is the real-world applicability of the project proposal?
    Does it solve an important problem or provide a useful function for the community?
    \&#42; Are there opportunities for the intern to network and collaborate with Fedora contributors in other parts of the community?


    [[best-practices]]
    == Coordinator best practices and conflict resolution

    Sometimes, coordinators are asked to help in difficult situations and to mediate conflicts.
    Although this scenario is uncommon and Fedora generally has a high completion rate for Fedora Mentored Projects, sometimes difficult situations arise and conflicts must be resolved.
    Coordinators play an important role as mediators in conflicts, whether this is between program administrators and project mentors, or project mentors and interns.
    Because every scenario is unique and different, there is not a fixed set of rules about how to solve conflicts when they arise.
    Coordinators should use their best judgment and the context available to make the best decision possible for our interns, our mentors, and our community.
    However, instead of a fixed set of rules, there are general best practices and important considerations when stepping into this conflict mediation role as a Fedora Mentored Projects coordinator.
