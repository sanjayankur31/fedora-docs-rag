# Governance {#_governance}

Governance rules for the Fedora Workstation Working Group, an
independent subcommittee of FESCo.

## Membership {#_membership}

Members of the Working Group are chosen by the Working Group as needed
to maintain a reasonably-sized working group. The Working Group may fill
a seat by selecting a candidate and approving by majority of the Working
Group membership. Eligible candidates must be in the FPCA+1 group. The
Working Group is encouraged to seek out candidates that have been
showing persistent and high-quality contribution to Workstation
technology or direction.

[See current members list.](members.xml)

## Meetings {#_meetings}

The Working Group meets on a regular basis. A quorum, comprised of a
majority of the Working Group, is required to conduct business and make
binding decisions at meetings.

The Working Group will keep records of discussions, meetings, and votes,
and will make these records public to the Fedora community. The Working
Group shall generally be open to public observation. However, the
Working Group may meet in private when necessary to discuss for
sensitive issues, such as legal issues, provided that such private
meetings are rare and that the public record indicates that a private
meeting occurred and the general topic of the private discussion.

## Making decisions {#_making_decisions}

The Working Group may make binding decisions on any matters affecting
the Fedora Workstation product, including any software contained in the
product.

The Working Group generally operates by consensus. Formal votes are not
required to resolve issues except when disagreement exists. When Working
Group members wish to hold a vote, voting may occur either using an
online platform accessible to the Fedora community, or during meetings
of the Working Group. Working group members can vote +1 to approve, -1
to disagree, or 0 to abstain; a majority vote is necessary for a measure
to pass, with abstain votes not being included in the count.

Working Group decisions may be overruled by FESCo.

## Changing these rules {#_changing_these_rules}

This document was originally approved by consensus of the initial
Working Group members and by FESCo. Future substantive changes may be
approved by majority vote and sent to FESCo for acceptance.

# Fedora Workstation PRD {#_fedora_workstation_prd}

&#42;May 2022&#42;

This document provides an overview of the goals and objectives of Fedora
Workstation. It is intended to allow people to understand the role of
Fedora Workstation and how it is likely to develop in future.

The Fedora Workstation PRD is primarily intended for other Fedora
Project teams, contributors and stakeholders, so they can better
understand Workstation's role, goals and current priorities.

## Fedora Workstation Vision {#_fedora_workstation_vision}

Fedora Workstation envisions an open world where developers and creators
can easily make new and exciting things with accessible digital
platforms.

## Fedora Workstation Mission {#_fedora_workstation_mission}

Our mission is to continuously advance Fedora Workstation: to make it an
ever more capable and powerful operating system for laptops and
desktops, and to continually narrow the gap between it and the needs of
its users. We aim to continually increase Workstation's capacity to help
developers and creators, and to grow the Workstation user and
contributor community.

## The Workstation Market {#_the_workstation_market}

This section describes the audience for Fedora Workstation, our main
pitch for that audience, and our main routes to market.

### Market opportunity {#_market_opportunity}

Laptop and desktop devices are at the heart of many creative areas,
including software, multimedia, engineering, science, and design. In all
these fields, a desktop computer is an essential tool. As such, the
critical role of the desktop is firmly established in the market.

The desktop market also has important effects which are felt more
widely. Desktops can help to popularize the technologies and ecosystems
with which they are associated, and they can be a vehicle for
communicating values, principles and practices.

Finally, desktop computers are an important gateway for people who are
starting out in their personal journeys in computing, and are a powerful
educational and learning tool. Many people remember the first time they
installed a Linux operating system as a key moment in their lives.
Fedora Workstation wants to be part of that experience, and to make it
as good as it possibly can be.

#### A desktop for developers and creators {#_a_desktop_for_developers_and_creators}

Workstation's historical focus has been on developer use cases. In
practical terms, this translates to:

&#42; Availability of high quality developer tools, frameworks and
platforms. &#42; Fantastic command line experience. &#42; Prioritization
of desktop features which are particularly relevant to developers,
including multi-monitor, VPN, and remote desktop. &#42; A desktop
experience which caters to developers, with features like keyboard-based
app launching, window snapping, and a focus on distraction free
computing. &#42; Support for developer class hardware. &#42; A high
level of reliability and stability.

However, it should be stressed that developers also require other more
basic desktop features and product qualities. Our focus on developers
therefore does not compromise our goal to create a polished and user
friendly system that appeals to a wide general audience. Many changes
and improvements we implement for developers are equally beneficial to
other user segments.

Most recently, we have expanded our goals to include other types of
digital content creation, in addition to software developers. This
expansion of the [initial Fedora Workstation
goals](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/Workstation_PRD)
reflects our success in the developer space, and a desire to have
broader aspirations.)

#### Use cases {#_use_cases}

Broad user types that we are interested in include:

&#42; Undergraduate and postgraduate students &#42; Independent
developers and content creators &#42; Developers working in both large
and small organizations

Activities that we are focused on supporting include:

&#42; Student coursework for CS programs &#42; Full stack software
development &#42; Game development --- and playing games! &#42; DevOps
and systems administration &#42; Podcasting and video streaming

### Why use Fedora Workstation {#_why_use_fedora_workstation}

First and foremost, Fedora Workstation fulfills the most important,
basic requirements that people have for a modern desktop operating
system:

&#42; can be relied upon to be usable whenever you need it, without bugs
or software updates getting in your way &#42; a large collection of
applications and other software available to install &#42; easy to use
and learn, from the very first use or install, through to learning more
advanced tasks &#42; support for a wide range of high-quality hardware
&#42; fantastic user experience

Additionally, it has special qualities which are unique to Fedora:

&#42; provides access to the latest and best open source software,
including new cutting-edge features and technologies &#42; a welcoming
and supportive user community &#42; part of the wider Fedora and Red Hat
ecosystem &#42; developed in the open, in collaboration with upstream
projects and communities, following the open source way

### Go to market {#_go_to_market}

Since our goal is to increase the number of people using Fedora
Workstation, it is critical to ensure direct and effective routes to our
target audiences. There are three primary routes to market.

#### 1. Self-installation {#_1_self_installation}

Self-installation has been and continues to be our primary route to
market. Here, the user installs and manages the system themselves.

Some requirements here:

&#42; Attractive landing site and download page &#42; Create install
media from a variety of operating systems (via Fedora Media Writer)
&#42; Live media for testing and demos &#42; Install alongside a pre
existing OS (primarily Windows) &#42; Easy access to help when questions
arise

#### 2. Preinstalled OS {#_2_preinstalled_os}

Here, the operating system is installed by the hardware manufacturer
prior to it being shipped to the user. The preinstallation route to
market has been a significant focus for Workstation, that has delivered
results through our partnership with Lenovo.

Requirements for manufacturer preinstallation include:

&#42; Supporting the hardware that Fedora is preinstalled on (to be
delivered in partnership with key hardware vendors) &#42; Initial system
setup should be compatible with OEM installation scenarios &#42;
Firmware updates for hardware shipped with Fedora

#### 3. Managed deployments {#_3_managed_deployments}

In a managed deployment, the route to market is through organizations
which choose to widely deploy and support Fedora. The OS is installed by
an administrator, and aspects of the machine are monitored and
administered by the organization.

Managed deployments are less developed than Workstation's other routes
to market and this route poses some challenges. However, it remains an
important area that we continue to investigate.

Relevant features include:

&#42; Initial system setup &#42; Enterprise login &#42; Remote auditing
&#42; Remote configuration and management &#42; System customization for
managed cases (for example, customized initial setup and Software
categories)

## Fedora Workstation Objectives {#_fedora_workstation_objectives}

This objectives section covers our operational activities in more
detail, in pursuit of the broader ambitions described above.

In operational terms, Fedora Workstation's main goals are to:

&#42; Be a great developer workstation &#42; Be a great general-purpose
OS targeting laptops and desktops &#42; Work well for content creation
(podcasts, video streaming, etc)

Fedora Workstation has had a period of success and has been recognised
for delivering a high-quality desktop with new and exciting features. As
we move forward, we aim to continue on this upward trajectory by
continuing to ensure quality and reliability, while pursuing technology
and UX improvements.

Particular areas of interest include:

&#42; Developer focused features &#42; Growing the Fedora contributor
community &#42; Features and capabilities for content creation, such as
podcasting and video streaming &#42; Supporting managed Fedora
Workstation deployments &#42; Filling in outstanding missing pieces
around hardware support, multimedia support, security features &#42;
Increasing the number of apps that are available to install out of the
box &#42; Enhanced marketing and mindshare

### Functional requirements {#_functional_requirements}

The following describes the features and product attributes that we
believe are most important to Fedora Workstation's success.

#### Quality releases {#_quality_releases}

We continually work to ensure that the core product offered is of the
highest quality possible. This includes keeping the core test matrix as
small as possible, using a high degree of testing automation, and
collaborating with upstream projects to increase general test coverage
of core modules. We work closely with Fedora QE and Release Engineering
to ensure that Workstation releases are of consistently high quality.

#### Robust upgrades {#_robust_upgrades}

Because of the fast refreshes and relatively short life cycle of Fedora
Linux releases, we need upgrades to be pain-free. Users should approach
them without fear.

Upgrading the system multiple times through the upgrade process should
give a result that is the same as an original install of Fedora
Workstation. Upgrade should be a safe process that never leaves the
system needing manual intervention.

If there are any problems with an upgrade or an upgrade breaks a
configuration script, we want to offer an easy way for users to roll
back such upgrades and changes.

#### Broad application availability {#_broad_application_availability}

Our goal is to provide easy access to common best in class desktop
applications, including:

&#42; general desktop apps for web browsing, music, cloud drives and
chat &#42; development tools, including IDEs, compilers, debugging and
testing tools &#42; content creation tools, such as multimedia recording
and process, and image and video editing

Flatpak and the third party repositories are key initiatives towards
this goal. We also aim to extend the availability of apps in the main
Fedora repositories wherever possible.

#### Platform integration {#_platform_integration}

Software installed by default in Fedora Workstation should integrate
with other platform components and adhere to the overall vision for
Fedora Workstation. Software is expected to support Wayland and follow
the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines. Exceptions to this should be rare.

#### Accessibility {#_accessibility}

From installing to using the Fedora Workstation, users with special
needs shouldn't be presented with any obstacles and have a pleasant
experience.

#### Virtual machine and container experience {#_virtual_machine_and_container_experience}

We aim to provide a first class experience for containers and virtual
machines, including:

&#42; Availability of container tools, including Podman, Skopeo, Buildah
and OpenShift. &#42; High quality, easy to use, virtual machine tooling,
through GNOME Boxes. &#42; High quality container development
experience, including desktop integration for containers, and
availability of OpenShift tooling and integrations (for example, the
OpenShift VS Code plugin).

#### Encapsulation of development environments (Toolbx) {#_encapsulation_of_development_environments_toolbx}

It should be possible to target deployment environments that are
different from the operating system itself. An upgrade to a newer
version of Fedora Workstation should not mean that a coding project
needs to be modified to work with new versions of libraries and
runtimes.

#### Support multimedia use cases {#_support_multimedia_use_cases}

&#42; Available applications to record and stream audio and video &#42;
Support for AV equipment &#42; OS support for high dynamic range
(primarily of interest to those doing image and video editing) &#42;
Hardware acceleration for video encoding

#### Documentation {#_documentation}

Users and administrators should be able to find information about how to
use and manage their operating system on the system itself (offline
through GNOME Help, manual pages and others) as well as on Fedora
Project websites.

# Third-Party Repositories {#_third_party_repositories}

The Fedora Workstation Third Party repositories provide access to
additional desktop software that is not included in Fedora's own repos.
The repositories are selected and managed by the [Fedora Workstation
Working Group](index.xml), in accordance with [FESCo's third party
repository
policy](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Third_Party_Repository_Policy/).

The third-party repositories exist to provide access to additional
software that may be necessary or important for users to have access to.
This includes some proprietary software.

While facilitating the use of some proprietary software, the Fedora
project continues to strongly believe in and promote [free and open
source software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). As a
result, third party repositories must be enabled by the user in order to
be used, and open source alternatives are recommended wherever possible.

## How to use {#_how_to_use}

The following are basic instructions for how to use the third-party
repositories.

### Enabling third-party repositories {#_enabling_third_party_repositories}

To install software from the third-party repositories, they must first
be enabled. The easiest way to do this is in the Third-Party
Repositories page of initial setup.

Alternative methods to enable the third-party repositories include:

&#42; Through the dialog that is shown in the Software app when
third-party repositories are not enabled. &#42; Enabling Third-Party
Repositories in the Software app's Software Repository settings.

Note: The repositories are preinstalled on every current Workstation,
through the package &#96;fedora-workstation-repositories&#96;.

### Installing from third-party repositories {#_installing_from_third_party_repositories}

Once the repos are enabled, the software they contain can be installed
in the usual way. The repos can also be searched and installed using the
&#96;dnf&#96; or &#96;flatpak&#96; commands, depending on the packaging
format used.

### Managing third-party repositories {#_managing_third_party_repositories}

The Software Repository settings in the Software app can be used to see
which third-party repositories are enabled, or to enable and disable
individual repositories.

## Included software {#_included_software}

The following software is included in the third-party repositories:

# Software Repositories &amp; Tools {#_software_repositories_amp_tools}

This page includes information about the software formats, tools and
repositories that are included in Fedora Workstation.

## Default Software Repositories {#_default_software_repositories}

Workstation comes with a set of software repositories enabled out of the
box. These allow preinstalled software to be updated, as well as new
packages and apps to be installed.

Workstation's default software repositories are:

&#42; Official Fedora RPM repositories. Workstation system components
and applications are provided in RPM format, using the main Fedora
repositories. &#42; Fedora Flatpaks. Workstation comes with the Flatpak
app distribution tool installed by default. It also includes a
repository of Flatpak apps, which are built and hosted by the Fedora
project, and which are available to be installed. &#42; Linux Vendor
Firmware Service (LVFS). Workstation uses fwupd to provide firmware
updates from LVFS. This is enabled by default.

## Third-Party Repositories {#_third_party_repositories_2}

Fedora Workstation also includes a set of [third-party
repositories](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/workstation-working-group/third-party-repos/).
These software repositories are provided by projects and organizations
other than Fedora, and provide access to a wider range of software than
the default offering. They can be enabled with the click of a button
during initial setup, or in the Software app.

## Installing &amp; Updating Software {#_installing_amp_updating_software}

Workstation includes the GNOME Software app, which makes it easy to find
and install apps, and to install software updates.

Workstation also comes with a set of command line tools that can be used
for software management. These are:

&#42; &#96;dnf&#96;: Fedora's default package manager. See [this
guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/) for
information on how to get started with DNF. &#42; &#96;flatpak&#96;: the
Flatpak tool can be used to install and update graphical applications
that are provided as Flatpaks. See [this
guide](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/using-flatpak.html) to get
started with the Flatpak CLI. &#42; &#96;fwupdmgr&#96;: the command line
utility for fwupd. This can be used to update firmware.

## Release Schedule, Updates &amp; Upgrades {#_release_schedule_updates_amp_upgrades}

Fedora Workstation follows the [standard Fedora release
schedule](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/): a new version
is produced every six months, and each version receives updates for 13
months.

Fedora's smooth upgrade process means that it's easy to stay up to date,
and transitioning from one version to the next is easy and pain free
(though we still recommend that you backup before upgrading). Upgrading
can be done using the Software app, which shows a notification when a
new version is available. You can also [upgrade using the command
line](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf-system-upgrade/).

## Proprietary &amp; Patent Encumbered Software {#_proprietary_amp_patent_encumbered_software}

In accordance with Fedora principles and policy, Fedora Workstation only
includes open source software. Workstation is also prevented from
including patent-encumbered software. This poses challenges in cases
where such software is required by particular hardware or multimedia
formats.

Open source technologies are always the preferred option for
Workstation. However, in important cases where no viable open source
option exists, and where it is safe to do so, mechanisms are provided to
gain access to particular proprietary and patent encumbered software.

### NVIDIA Graphics {#_nvidia_graphics}

Fedora Workstation works to ensure that the open source Nouveau driver
provides an excellent experience for NVIDIA hardware. However, when
features that are exclusive to the proprietary driver are required, it
can be installed by enabling the Third Party Repositories.

### H.264 Codecs {#_h_264_codecs}

Due to patent issues, Fedora cannot distribute the H.264 multimedia
codec itself. However, Workstation does automatically install this codec
for users, from a non-Fedora source.

# Disk Configuration {#_disk_configuration}

Fedora Workstation uses a different default disk configuration from
other Fedora Editions and Spins. This page describes that configuration
along with the motivations behind it.

Other, non-default, disk configuration options are available to be used
with Workstation, and can be configured during the disk partitioning

## Btrfs {#_btrfs}

Btrfs is the default filesystem used by Fedora Workstation. Btrfs has
two key advantages for users using the default filesystem configuration:

1.  Transparent compression means that data stored on disk uses less
    space

2.  System reinstallation while preserving user data can be supported,
    while avoiding the issue of volumes running out of space. This is
    due to the fact that Btrfs subvolumes are not limited to a static
    predefined size.

Btrfs also provides a range of other features, such as snapshotting and
online shrinking, which can be useful for those who want to use them,
and can potentially be the basis of future user-facing features.

Fedora Magazine contains a number of [excellent articles about
Btrfs](https://fedoramagazine.org/?s=btrfs).

## Default Disk Layout {#_default_disk_layout}

By default, a Workstation installation has the following disk layout:

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Role                 | Filesystem           | Mount Point           |
+======================+======================+=======================+
| EFI System Partition | FAT 32               | &#96;/boot/efi&#96;   |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Boot Partition       | ext4                 | &#96;/boot&#96;       |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Root Subvolume       | Btrfs                | &#96;/&#96;           |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Home Subvolume       | Btrfs                | &#96;/home&#96;       |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

The first two partitions are common to all Fedora installations, and are
required for booting the system. The root subvolume contains the system
installation, and the home subvolume contains user data and settings.

## Swap on ZRAM {#_swap_on_zram}

Fedora Workstation does not use a dedicated swap partition. Instead, it
uses zram: an emulated drive that uses RAM for its storage. RAM-based
swap is faster than disk-based swap, which avoids the extreme system
slowdown and thrashing that can happen with a traditional swap
partition.

The zram drive is compressed, to make efficient use of the available
memory, and is assigned memory dynamically, meaning that it only uses
system RAM when swap is needed.

# Problem Solving &amp; Issue Reporting {#_problem_solving_amp_issue_reporting}

This page includes general information on how to investigate and report
issues with Fedora Workstation.

## Diagnostic Tools {#_diagnostic_tools}

Workstation includes a set of graphical and command line tools which can
be used to investigate and diagnose issues, if they happen.

Graphical tools include:

&#42; &#42;System Monitor&#42;: can be used to see if system resources
are being exceeded, and which processes are using the most resources.
&#42; &#42;Logs&#42;: a graphical viewer app for system and application
logs. &#42; &#42;Problem Reporting&#42;: automatically detects crashes,
and allows reporting of crash data. In some cases the Problem Reporting
tool will link to existing issue reports for a crash.

Command line diagnostic tools which are preinstalled in Fedora
Workstation include:

&#42; &#96;top&#96;: command line system monitor. &#42;
&#96;journalctl&#96;: command line interface for viewing systemd logs.
Learn [how to get started with
journalctl](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/viewing-logs/).
&#42; &#96;coredumpctl&#96;: command line interface for analyzing
software crashes. [Fedora Magazine has a good article on getting started
with
coredumpctl](https://fedoramagazine.org/file-better-bugs-coredumpctl/).

&#35;&#35;&#35; Issue Reporting

Issues that need to be tracked as part of the Fedora release process,
such as potential release blockers, should be reported against the
correct component in [Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/).

For other issues, it is recommended to create reports directly with the
relevant upstream project. The GNOME Project is the upstream for much of
the software that makes up Fedora Workstation. Issues with GNOME
components can be reported using [GNOME's Gitlab
instance](https://gitlab.gnome.org).

&#35;&#35;&#35; Out Of Memory (OOM) Handling

When the system is running out of memory, Fedora Workstation
automatically forces processes to quit, in order to ensure that the
system can continue to function.

If applications or processes suddenly close, it could be due to memory
pressure. Check the logs to see if a OOM event was recorded, and check
system resources to see if your system is approaching its memory limits.
