== What is Fedora?

[.lead]
The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a
free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share
user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we
make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff
with it.


\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;


== What is Fedora all about?

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different
views and approaches, but together we share some common values.
We call these the “\&#42;Four Foundations\&#42;”: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.

== Our Vision
____
_The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities._
____

As a project, we want everyone to live in a universe of free and open source software; the user should be in control of their computing.
But it’s not enough that the software is there, waiting to be used.
It has to be accessible and usable.
This vision also reflects our community approach — the Friends foundation.
Fedora isn’t bits and bytes.
Fedora is our people, and we want the statement to include our vision of a healthy community.

== Our Mission

____
_Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
containers that enables software developers and community members to
build tailored solutions for their users._
____

At the operating system level, we don’t just integrate. We do new things
— we build a _platform_, not just a distribution. The _Features_ and
_First_ foundations drive us to innovate. We do all of this as a
transparent, collaborative community of _Friends_, and entirely as open
source and free software — _Freedom_.


== Our Method

The Fedora Project is a center for innovation in free and open source
software. In our community, contributors of all kinds come together to
advance the ecosystem for the benefit of everyone. The Fedora community
contributes everything it builds back to the free and open source world
and continues to make advances of significance to the broader community,
as evidenced by the regular and rapid incorporation of its features into
other Linux distributions. Regardless of which Linux distribution you
use, you are relying on code developed within the Fedora Project.

We believe software patents
are harmful, a hindrance to innovation in software development, and are
inconsistent with the values of free and open source software. While tightly
integrating proprietary and patent encumbered components might superficially
improve ease of use, this practice does not benefit the community in the
long run. The Fedora community prefers approaches that benefit the progress
of free software in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of
use.


== Our Community

Fedora is more than just software. It is a community of contributors
from https://fedoracommunity.org/[around the world], including volunteers
and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance the interests
of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join. No matter
what your skills are, we have a place for you in our community! We are
xref:package-maintainers::index.adoc[software engineers],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design[designers and artists],
xref:infra::index.adoc[system administrators],
xref:websites::index.adoc[web designers],
xref:fedora-docs::index.adoc[writers],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors[speakers],
xref:localization::index.adoc[translators], and more — and we are happy to help you get
started.

We believe that all contributors should
https://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct[be excellent to each other].
By creating an environment for constructive contribution, we can more
effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size,
diversity, and strength of our community.


== Leadership and Governance

The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is responsible for
stewardship of the Fedora Project as a whole and supports the health and
growth of the Fedora Community. As in any large project, there are many
different levels of responsibility, accountability, and decision-making. As
a general rule, we want people working on a Fedora
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Subprojects[subproject] to make meaningful decisions about their
areas of interest and expertise. More details are available on our page on
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Leadership[Fedora Leadership].


= Upstream First: A Core Fedora Principle

The concept of 'upstream first' is a fundamental principle within the Fedora Project.
It shapes our history, culture, and approach to contributing to the open source ecosystem.
Understanding this principle is crucial for anyone looking to contribute to Fedora and the broader Linux distribution ecosystem.


[[upstream-why]]
== Fedora's Commitment to Upstream First

Fedora, as a Linux distribution, plays a unique role as an _integrator_ of countless software components.
While Fedora develops some of its own software, its primary function is to package and deliver a cohesive operating system experience built upon the work of numerous upstream projects.

From its inception, Fedora has championed the principle of _upstream first_.
This isn't a policy or hard rule; it's a core value woven into the fabric of the Fedora community.
Fedora contributors believe that changes and improvements to open source software should, whenever possible, be shared back with the upstream projects.
This ensures that \&#42;all\&#42; users of that software, not just Fedora users, can benefit.
Ultimately, Fedora's final objective is the benefit of the user, and Fedora contributors will do what they think is best for the user, even if upstream disagrees.

Upstream first is also a pragmatic engineering principle.
By contributing changes upstream, Fedora reduces the long-term maintenance burden of carrying downstream-specific patches.
Maintaining external patch sets can become increasingly difficult as upstream projects evolve.
Embracing upstream first helps ensure the sustainability of Fedora and its contributions.

This approach has a ripple effect throughout the open source ecosystem.
Changes landed in Fedora often impact numerous downstream projects that use Fedora as a foundation.
Therefore, contributing to Fedora is a highly effective way to influence and improve the broader open source landscape, particularly within the RPM/Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

By prioritizing upstream contributions, Fedora aligns with its vision of a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive and welcoming communities.
This commitment extends to \&#42;all\&#42; open source software, not just Fedora itself.


[[upstream-downstream]]
== Understanding Upstream and Downstream

In the world of open source, projects often have interconnected relationships described as 'upstream' and 'downstream.'
The _upstream_ project is the original source of the software—the foundation upon which other projects are built.
_Downstream_ projects, in turn, are those that utilize and often modify the upstream software.
Think of it like a river: the upstream is the source, and downstream projects are further along the flow, receiving and potentially altering the water.

This metaphor is essential for understanding how open source projects depend on and interact with each other.
Different development models encourage varying types of upstream/downstream relationships.

[[upstream-communication]]
=== Open Communication with Upstream

Fedora recognizes the importance of clear and open communication with upstream projects.
We believe in fostering strong relationships with upstream developers and communities, and actively seek their input and feedback.

Fedora is always open to hearing from upstream projects about how we can improve our collaboration and integration processes.
We understand that Fedora's downstream usage can sometimes create challenges or friction for upstream projects.
We encourage upstream maintainers to reach out to us if they encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement.

Our goal is to work together constructively to find solutions that benefit both Fedora and the upstream projects we rely on.
While we cannot always accommodate every upstream request, we are committed to listening, learning, and adapting our practices to minimize any negative impact on upstream communities.

The philosophy of working upstream first doesn't end with just development.
It also encompasses a productive, positive, and respectful relationship with our upstream projects.
Our communities overlap and we want to extend our Fedora values to their project as much as we would within Fedora.
To that end we always want to deal with challenges between projects together and have clear lines of communication.

[[upstream-exceptions]]
=== When Downstream Changes Happen

While Fedora prioritizes upstream contributions, there are situations where downstream-specific changes are necessary.
These exceptions are not contradictions of the upstream-first principle, but rather acknowledgements of the complex realities of software development and distribution.

Reasons for downstream patches include:

\&#42; \&#42;Upstream Rejection\&#42;:
Sometimes, upstream maintainers may reject a patch for various reasons, even if it's beneficial to Fedora.
Fedora may still need to carry that patch to address a specific issue or requirement.
\&#42; \&#42;Upstream Progress\&#42;:
Upstream projects may move forward with new features or changes that require significant adaptation in Fedora.
Fedora may need to backport fixes or implement temporary workarounds while the downstream adaptation is completed.
\&#42; \&#42;Distribution-Specific Needs\&#42;:
Fedora, and its downstream distributions like EPEL, may have unique requirements or constraints that necessitate downstream modifications.
These needs might relate to specific hardware support, security considerations, or integration with other Fedora components.
\&#42; \&#42;Non-Free Blobs\&#42;:
Fedora is committed to promoting free and open source software and building everything from source.
Sometimes, upstream projects include non-free or pre-built binary blobs that Fedora needs to patch out to adhere to its principles.
While Fedora may discuss potential fixes with upstream, these patches might not always be accepted if there are no suitable alternatives or if they remove functionality.

In these situations, Fedora strives to minimize the scope and duration of downstream patches, and continues to work towards upstreaming changes whenever feasible.
Understanding the reasons for downstream changes is essential for maintaining transparency and trust within the community.


[[examples]]
== Examples in Action

The principle of 'upstream first' manifests in various ways.
Here are a couple of examples:

\&#42; \&#42;Packaging Improvements\&#42;:
A Fedora packager identifies a bug or missing feature in a build toolchain.
Instead of creating a Fedora-specific patch, they submit a patch upstream to the toolchain's maintainers.
After review and discussion, the patch is merged upstream, benefiting all users of the toolchain and eliminating the need for a downstream Fedora patch.
\&#42; \&#42;Community Script\&#42;:
A Fedora contributor develops a script for analyzing package data.
They share the script publicly.
Another contributor enhances the script with new features and submits a pull request.
The original contributor merges the changes, making the improved script available to the entire community.
\&#42; \&#42;License Clarifications\&#42;:
A Fedora packager discovers licensing issues with an open source project, such as unclear or non-compliant licenses for included assets.
Instead of simply excluding the project from Fedora, they work with the upstream developers to clarify or correct the licenses.
This ensures that the project can be included in Fedora and benefits the broader open source community by promoting license compliance.
\&#42; \&#42;Avoiding Bundled Dependencies\&#42;:
A Fedora packager notices that an upstream project bundles a specific version of a dependency.
Instead of using the bundled dependency, they repackage the project to use the system-wide version of the dependency.
This ensures consistency across Fedora packages, enables rapid security patch deployment, and maintains compatibility between interdependent packages.
\&#42; \&#42;Early Testing and Bug Reporting\&#42;:
Fedora often pioneers the integration of new software versions and libraries.
This early adoption allows Fedora contributors to identify and report build or compatibility bugs upstream, particularly in the Python ecosystem.
These contributions benefit the entire open source community by ensuring smoother transitions and upgrades for everyone.

These examples illustrate how upstream first fosters collaboration, shared ownership, and continuous improvement within the open source ecosystem.
We encourage you to think about how you can apply the 'Upstream First' principle in your Fedora contributions.
Have a story about an upstream contribution?
Share it with the community!


= Fedora Leadership

The Fedora Project is led by contributors from across the community.
Different functional areas of Fedora at times evolve, build, or dismantle their own formal (or informal!) leadership over time.
Because Fedora is an open source project, we encourage new contributors to identify problems, find solutions, and collaborate with other members to achieve results.
Our community recognizes and empowers able leaders from among our peers.

The Fedora Project aims to have a thin layer of governance that enables decision making without excessive drag.


The following are current examples of _leadership groups_ in Fedora.

== Fedora Council ==
image::council-badge.png[float='right',50%]

The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is the topmost governance and leadership body in Fedora, and is made up of appointed and elected members from across the Fedora community.
Details about the Council such as size, constitution, and succession planning are found in the xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council Charter].

The https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fpl/[Fedora Project Leader] (or 'FPL') serves as the chair of the Council.


== Fedora Engineering Steering Committee ==

The xref:fesco::index.adoc[Fedora Engineering Steering Committee] (commonly known as 'FESCo') is a community-elected body empowered by the Council to manage the technical features of the Fedora distribution and specific implementations of policy in the Fedora Project.
You can find further information about FESCo, its members, and its policies on the xref:fesco::index.adoc[FESCo section].


== Fedora Mindshare Committee ==

The xref:mindshare-committee::index.adoc[Mindshare Committee] represents leadership for user and contributor community growth and support.


== Other groups ==

The list above is not a complete list of every group of empowered community members.
Other groups steer specific parts of Fedora as well, empowered and supported by the relevant teams.
The list above shows the three leadership groups that most often work on issues of policy or practice affecting large portions of the Fedora Project.

Community members are always encouraged to get involved in leading Fedora in ways that are important to them, while minimizing overhead and governance project-wide.


=== Working Groups ===

Fedora https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Editions[Editions] — currently,
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Atomic_WG[Atomic],
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Server[Server],
and
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation[Workstation],
— and sometimes Fedora Project Objectives are lead by _Working Groups_.
These groups are either independent subcommittees of FESCo, Mindshare, or the Council.
They have formal membership and decision-making processes, but generally the membership is intended to include active contributors and the decision-making power reflects that.
A seat on the Working Group itself is _not at all_ required to participate meaningfully in the work on Editions or Objectives.


=== Subprojects ===

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/subprojects.html[Subprojects] are long-standing major areas of effort under the overall Fedora umbrella.
Each subproject has its own governance.


=== Special Interest Groups ===

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/subprojects/sigs.html[Special Interest Groups], or 'SIGs', are much less formal.
The process for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Creating_a_Fedora_SIG[creating a SIG] has \&#42;no red tape\&#42;.
Different SIGs have different structures; some use formalized voting and others don't.
Some SIGs may eventually become subprojects; for others, the lightweight framework is perfect.


= How is Fedora Organized?

image::orgchart.png[Fedora Organizational Chart,100%]

Fedora is a big project, with many moving parts and dozens of groups and subgroups.
This chart gives a general overview and a sense of how things fit together.
The xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is our overall leadership and governance body.
Most of the project is then roughly organized under https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/[FESCo]
(the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee) or the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/mindshare-committee/[Mindshare Committee].

xref:engineering::index.adoc[Engineering teams] includes a list of technical teams and
initiatives, most of which operate under FESCo.

Since many groups are rather informal, don't take the chart as written in stone. Also, if
it is a little overwhelming, don't worry. Fedora is a friendly project — just pick an area
you're interested in, introduce yourself to the people involved, and get started. Or, if
you don't know where to start, see xref:join.adoc[how to get involved].

== The Fedora Logo

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs, including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth tablecloths and banners, and other printed material.

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement of free and open source software and content.

== The Dos and Donts of the Fedora Logo

Don't search for the logos on a search engine and use whatever you find there. There are many unofficial variations on the Fedora logos that are not authorized, are unofficial, and do not respect these guidelines. Please do not use them or spread them further!

Here are some guidelines you should avoid if you would like to use some of our logos:

[grid=none,_frame=none]
|=======================
|image:/do-not-adjust.png[alt='Do not adjust any of the logos'] Do not adjust any of the logos | image:/do-not-colour.png[alt='Do not switch the colors'] Do not switch the colors
|image:/do-not-background.png[alt='Do not use the logo on a similarly-colored backgrounds'] Do not use the logo on a similarly-colored backgrounds | image:/do-not-rearrange.png[alt='Do not rearrange elements of the logo'] Do not rearrange elements of the logo
|image:/do-not-stray.png[alt='Do not stray from the color palette'] Do not stray from the color palette | image:/do-not-distort.png[alt='Do not stretch or distort the logo'] Do not stretch or distort the logo

|=======================

== Colors

We keep a single color palette to keep our artwork consistent, whether it is different Fedora materials, Fedora materials on screen, on the web, or on printed materials. Past mistakes have included Fedora DVDs coming out purple (true story!) so please pay attention to these colors, and please always use CMYK colors for professionally-printed collateral and objects such as printed banners, T-shirts, hats, and stickers. Otherwise, your design may well come out purple instead of blue!

=== The Main Palette

=== Color-blind safe palette

image::/colour-blind-safe-palette.png[alt='Color-blind safe palette']

== Typography

We recommend the following complementary fonts to use along with the logos. Both recommended fonts are openly licensed and freely distributable.

We recommend using Open Sans as a body text / copy font. It comes in a wide range of weights.

We recommend using Montserrat as a titling / headline font. Montserrat is also used in the Fedora Editions logos.

image::/fonts.png[alt='Selection of fonts that can be used']

== Characters

Most of these characters were created as part of the Fedora Characters Revamp Project. These mascots can be used in different projects.

You will be introduced to Badger, Beefy, Panda and Colúr and their history within the Fedora Community along with what part they belong to as well.

=== Panda


Panda is a happy go-lucky panda with glowing ears and a glowing nuclear symbol on her stomach and was originally created as a helper. You were able to find her on on the 404 and 500 pages and also was in the Fedora Docs pointing out tips and tricks. Panda is female and is a general mascot for the Fedora community. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake redesigned the Panda during the Fedora Character Revamp Project.

=== Badger

Badger is the Fedora Badges mascot and has been featured on a lot of different badges throughout the years. Badger was fist inspired by a popular early 2000's internet meme involving badgers and snakes. Badger is non-binary. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake brought them to life by creating a new style for  the Badger to fit in to the Fedora style.

=== Beefy


Beefy is a general mascot for the Fedora Community. He was the release name for Fedora 17 and has been a popular character even before Fedora Linux! He became a meme between Linux users. Beefy is male and on his belly, the mustard indicates progress. He was also a bootup screen for Fedora in past years and as it was loading, the mustard on his belly grew. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake revamped the style of Beefy and created him in many poses.  If you would like to know more about the origins of the Beefy Miracle, please visit:

=== Colúr

Colúr is our newest character that was created as a mascot for our Flock events. In 2022, Jess Chitas created him to go along with the Flock events and to also bring a new Fedora character to the table! He is based on the Pink-Necked Green Pigeon and his name came from the Irish meaning Pigeon but also sounds like the word 'Color'.

= What are Community Initiatives?
:page-aliases: objectives.adoc

Want to do something big?
Have an idea that won’t fit in a single release cycle?
Perhaps an improvement broader than the technical scope covered by the Changes policy?
Want to make sure the community is aligned behind your goal, and that you have the resources and access you need to make it happen?
\&#42;A Community Initiative may be the framework for you!\&#42;

Fedora Community Initiatives (formerly 'Objectives') are projects which do not fall neatly into the biannual Fedora Linux release cycle.
Typically they require longer to complete (e.g. 8-18 months) and are not limited to engineering projects.
Other key areas are administration; documentations; outreach; motivation; communications; budgets and best practice.
Within the Project these are grouped under a heading of xref:mindshare-committee::index.adoc[Mindshare].
The Council looks to achieve a balance between engineering projects and those aligned with Mindshare.

The primary role of the xref:council::index.adoc[Fedora Council] is to identify the short-, medium-, and long-term goals of the Fedora community and to organize and enable the project to best achieve them.
Anyone can propose a Community Initiative to the Council.
To be accepted, it should align with Fedora’s xref:project::index.adoc\&#35;_our_mission[mission statement] and long-term goals.

Each Community Initiative has a designated Community Initiative Lead.
This Lead sits on the Council for the duration of the Initiative and is responsible for coordinating efforts to reach the Community Initiative’s goals, as well as evaluating and reporting on progress.
The Initiative Lead works regularly with all relevant groups in Fedora to ensure that progress is made.


[[proposing]]
== Proposing a Community Initiative

To propose a Community Initiative to the Council, the Lead should first discuss on the https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/council[\&#35;council tag on Fedora Discussion].
Next, if well-received, file a https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/[ticket].
Of course, people need to be ready to do the actual work required — a Community Initiative without passionate bottom-liners will not get far.

To succeed, Community Initiatives require a leadership team with division of responsibility.
For example separating roles of project leadership, engineering, marketing and documentation, depending on the size and scope of the Initiative.
The Council can assist a proposer in finding the right people to work on the project if required.

[[proposing-sponsors]]
=== Executive Sponsors

Every Community Initiative must have an Executive Sponsor.
This can be any current member of the Council – even, possibly, the Lead of another Initiative.
You should find a sponsor as part of community discussion before filing a ticket.
Once someone has agreed to the responsibility, the proposal can move forward.

[[proposing-sponsors-role]]
==== Role of the Executive Sponsor

A Fedora Council member becomes an Executive Sponsor until completion of the Community Initiative or for the duration of their Council term (whichever comes first).
The Executive Sponsor is responsible for partnering with the Lead as a connection point to the Fedora Project at a high-level.
The Executive Sponsor represents a wider view of what the Fedora Project is focused on, whether that is in terms of the Fedora strategy or a specific area of interest (e.g. DEI, Engineering, Mindshare).
The Executive Sponsor is not responsible for doing the work directly, but rather as an advocate for the initiative and can help by unlocking resources, help unblock work, act as a consultant on Council and Project perspectives and generally supporting the initiative to allow the work to succeed.

An Executive Sponsor may find that they are no longer able to fill this role for a Community Initiative, whether due to an expiring Council term or that they do not have the capacity to continue.
In this event, the Executive Sponsor and the Lead must work together to identify another Fedora Council member who can be the Executive Sponsor.

[[proposing-sponsors-relationship]]
==== Relationship between Lead and Executive Sponsor

How the Community Initiative Lead and the Executive Sponsor collaborate is largely up to them.
However, it is suggested that the Lead and Sponsor have a regular meeting cadence (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) to check in on progress and identify challenges.
The Lead should provide updates to the Executive Sponsor on the work, engagement with the community, and requests for help in order to succeed.
The Lead should expect the Executive Sponsor to ask them questions, suggest other teams or people to collaborate with, and give suggestions on how to acquire the needed resources to succeed.
Periodically, the Executive Sponsor will ask the Lead to share progress or milestones back to the wider Fedora Council.


[[completing]]
== How are Community Initiatives Finalized?

At the end of the expected duration of the Initiative (as specified at the proposal / acceptance stage), the Council will assess the progress of the Initiative.
If all of the aims or the most significant of them are achieved, the Initiative will be terminated.
If the aims are nearly complete and further work substantially increases the impact, it may be allowed to continue for a further agreed period.
After that, it will be terminated.
Initiatives will not be allowed to run indefinitely.


[[current]]
== Current 12-18 Month Community Initiatives

This section documents the current Initiatives the Council have accepted:

[[forge]]
=== Git Forge Initiative 2025

Vision::
To empower Fedora developers and the Fedora community with a streamlined workflow through a consolidated Git source control and issue tracking solution, powered by Forgejo on Fedora Infrastructure.

Mission::
To consolidate Fedora's source code management, issue tracking, and project hosting onto a single Forgejo platform deployed on the Fedora OpenShift Cluster, replacing Bugzilla and sun-setting Pagure (src.fedoraproject.org and pagure.io), while offering a migration path for Fedora Project repositories currently hosted on external platforms.

Community Initiative Lead::
Ryan Lerch (link:{url_wiki}/User:Ryanlerch[@ryanlerch])

Executive Sponsor::
Aoife Moloney (link:{url_wiki}/User:Amoloney[@amoloney]), with Jef Spaleta (link:{url_wiki}/User:Jspaleta[@jspaleta]) filling in for Aoife's maternity leave

Timeframe::
18 months

Community Initiative Details::
See the link:{url_wiki}/Initiatives/Git_Forge_Initiative_2025[wiki page].


[[history]]
== History

See link:{url_wiki}/Objectives/Completed[completed Community Initiatives] and link:{url_wiki}/Objectives/Potential[potential Community Initiatives].

Historically, Community Initiatives were known as Objectives.
This transition was made in February 2023 following in-person discussion by the Fedora Council in our 2023 Council hackfest in Frankfurt, Germany.
We agreed to convert 'Objectives' into 'Community Initiatives', which the Council felt was easier to understand and communicate the roles of these efforts in Fedora.
There is no functional change to Objectives; it is just a semantic change.


= Communication in Fedora

As referenced on the xref:join.adoc[Get Involved] page below, Fedora is a massive global organisation with many people with different skills carrying out different roles.
As you get involved you may need to find assistance and the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] page can help you with that.
This current page goes into more detail around the various communication channels within the Project.

== Primary Channels

=== Chat

We now use https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Matrix/Element] as the primary synchronous channel to speak to each other in real time.

You can find a list of the Fedora channels on Matrix https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;fedora-space:fedoraproject.org[here].

=== Fedora Discussion

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Fedora Discussion] is the primary discussion forum where you will find all the latest news \&amp; announcements, as well as discussion about open source projects; workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Fedora Editions.
See also under xref:help.adoc[Getting Help].

=== Ask Fedora

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora] sits within Fedora Discussion and  is the main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora Project.
Ask Fedora is a good place to go for support and troubleshooting help, as mentioned on the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] page.


== Other Communication Channels

As above, https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Fedora Discussion] is now the primary platform for longer asynchronous discussions where short-lived chats may not be enough.
Some teams do still use mailing lists though.
The most significant mailing lists are:

\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[announce]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/[devel-announce]
\&#42; https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test@lists.fedoraproject.org/[test]

For a catalog of all the mailing lists look at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/[lists.fedoraproject.org]

https://fedoramagazine.org[Fedora Magazine] is a great resource for user-facing announcements and cool stories about usage, features, etc\&#8230;

https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org[Fedora Community Blog] brings you contributor-facing announcements and updates.
Within the Community Blog you'll also find https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/fridays-fedora-facts/[Friday's Fedora Facts].
These are weekly posts with status updates, schedule info, etc..

The Fedora Pagure source control repository allows posting of  https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/council-docs/issues[issues] which can be discussed, assigned and remediated.
Here you can raise issues or view, comment on, and request to act on open issues.

There are a number of official and other social media accounts, on various networks.
You can find details of these documented on the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing_social_networks[Marketing Social Networks] Wiki page.

== Etiquette

In all our interactions, we aspire to _be excellent to each other_.
Read the xref:code-of-conduct.adoc[Code of Conduct] to learn more of what is expected of Fedora community members.


= Getting Help
There are several places to find help:

== Quick Docs
Firstly, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/[Fedora Quick Docs] is a collection of short HOWTO and FAQ style documentation for Fedora users.

== Fedora Documentation
Then there is the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[official documentation].
Many answers can be found here.
If you don't find what you need in the documentation or you need more detail, you can ask a question via the forums below.

== Fedora Discussion
Fedora has a strong community that is ready to help you.
Because users and contributors span the globe, a key element to the project is communication.
See the xref:communications.adoc[Project Communications] page for more details.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora] is the main community knowledge base and support forum hosted by the Fedora Project within Fedora Discussion (below).
Visit Ask Fedora for support and troubleshooting help.

Within https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Discussion] you will find all the latest news \&amp; announcements.
It is also the place to talk about open source projects, workflows, and Fedora-specific offerings such as the Editions:
Fedora Workstation, Fedora Server, Fedora CoreOS, Fedora Silverblue, and more\&#8230;.

== Fedora Chat
https://chat.fedoraproject.org[Fedora’s official chat platform] (powered by Matrix) is the place to go for more synchronous, real time communication.
Fedora Chat on Matrix is the preferred platform for the future of Fedora Chat, however many of the Fedora Linux channels on IRC at Libera Chat are still bridged to Fedora Chat on Matrix to allow continued use of IRC during the transition.

If you're interested in \&#42;why\&#42; Fedora's primary communications are moving to Matrix, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2A8BdU1gKg[this presentation] on the Fedora YouTube channel by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller.

== Bugzilla
If you believe you've found a bug you can report it through https://bugzilla.redhat.com/[Bugzilla].
The xref:quick-docs::bugzilla/index.adoc['Using Bugzilla'] page will give you any guidance you need to do this.
You can also ask on https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/ask/6/none[Ask Fedora (as above)] to get advice on filing a good bug report.


= Get Involved

image:Welcome-to-Fedora-banner.png[Welcome to Fedora banner,100%]

Welcome to Fedora!

This guide is intended for people that are interested in learning more about Fedora, perhaps with the intention of getting involved and contributing to the community.

You can refer to the xref:help.adoc[Getting Help] and xref:communications.adoc[Project Communications] pages for more specific information on how to find assistance via documentation and the various communication channels, such as Ask Fedora, and Fedora Chat (powered by Matrix).

== What is Fedora?

As described under xref:index.adoc[Mission and Foundations], the Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a Free and Open Source software platform:
the https://getfedora.org[Fedora Operating System], and its various editions.
You can learn more about the Project; our leadership; brand; current Community Initiatives and how we are organised using the pages linked in the left hand sidebar.


If you are looking to contribute and already have an idea of how and what to do, go ahead and get started!
If you are not so sure, read on.

== Contributing to Fedora

Fedora is a xref:orgchart.adoc[massive global organisation] where people with many different skills carry out xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[different roles] to keep the community ticking along.
All services used by the Fedora community are linked to a central Fedora account.
If you're intending to get involved you should get one https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/[here].

There is an excellent https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-contribute-to-fedora/[article in Fedora Magazine] covering in some detail the various ways you might get started.

== Not sure where to start? Come hang out with us!

The large scale of the community can sometimes make it a little daunting for new folks to join us.
There is far too much happening in Fedora all the time---even we find it hard to keep up with it all!
So, if you are not sure of where to begin or have any queries at all, come hang out with the xref:fedora-join::index.adoc[Fedora Join Special Interest Group (SIG)] on any of our channels:

- Chat (over Matrix/Element): https://chat.fedoraproject.org/\&#35;/room/\&#35;join:fedoraproject.org[Join Fedora on Matrix/Element],

- Email: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Join mailing list],

Here, you can speak to community members and other newcomers while we explore Fedora together.
We will help you learn the systems and processes that the Fedora community uses, and as you gain a better idea of where you would like to contribute, we will also help you learn the skills that you may need.

Taking initiative is an important quality in successful contributors.
So, go on, join a channel and introduce yourself to the community now!


= Sponsorship

Fedora has thousands of regular contributors who give freely of their time and efforts on a continual basis.
Participating in the community is a great way to support Fedora.

Companies may also choose to sponsor the annual https://flocktofedora.org/[Flock to Fedora conference] or our other in-person or virtual events.
These events connect our community and power the collaboration that makes the Fedora Project work.
Sponsorships allow us to bring together contributors from around the world — including people who might otherwise be unable to join.
Contact mailto:sponsors@fedoraproject.org[sponsors@fedoraproject.org] for more information.

To mirror the package repositories, see the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring[Mirroring page] or xref:infra::index.adoc\&#35;_communicating[contact the Infrastructure team].

If you are interested in other sponsorship possibilities, please xref:council::contact.adoc[contact the Fedora Council].


= Fedora Code of Conduct
Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community, Organization for Ethical Source, Python Software Foundation, Emma Irwin
v2.1, 2026-01-15
:page-aliases: council::policy/coc-response-policy.adoc

The Fedora Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our community behaves and what we value to members and outsiders.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and if it is deemed necessary.

The Fedora Code of Conduct is not “code” in the sense of being an algorithm or a computer program.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is not “blindly and algorithmically” executed but is instead enforced by humans making real decisions based on all of the available information and using all available context.

The Fedora Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize non-native speakers of English.
Instead the Fedora Code of Conduct spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be acceptable or unacceptable.
The Fedora Code of Conduct is, in many ways, the outward embodiment of the Friends component of Fedora’s Foundations.


[[pledge]]
== Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as the Fedora community pledge to collaborate in a respectful and constructive manner, and welcome everyone willing to join us in that pledge.
We welcome individuals regardless of ability, age, background, body size, education, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and expression, geographic location, level of experience, marital status, nationality, national origin, native language, personal appearance, race and/or ethnicity, religion, sexual identity and orientation, socioeconomic status, or any other dimension of diversity.

Our channels, mailing lists, and posts should focus on Fedora and on free and open source software and content.
We pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.
We pledge to avoid personal attacks on others, and to avoid inflammatory language and speech that perpetuates discrimination.
Furthermore, we pledge to not use the Fedora Project and its platforms as a basis to engage in personal campaigns against other organizations or individuals.


[[standards]]
== Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

\&#42; Using welcoming and inclusive language
\&#42; Being kind to others
\&#42; Behaving with civility
\&#42; Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
\&#42; Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
\&#42; Focusing on what is best for the community
\&#42; Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

\&#42; The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
\&#42; Initiating controversy for controversy’s sake (repeatedly asking disingenuous questions under a guise of sincerity)
\&#42; Saying insulting/derogatory comments and making personal attacks.
\&#42; Repeatedly instigating conflict, and baiting people into arguments
\&#42; Public or private harassment
\&#42; Publishing someone else’s private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
\&#42; Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
\&#42; Violent threats or language directed against another person
\&#42; Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary statements, even if they were meant as jokes
\&#42; Excessive swearing
\&#42; Unwelcome physical contact
\&#42; Sustained disruption of talks or other events
\&#42; Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting even if the conduct may be legal under the laws of some jurisdiction.


[[responsibilities]]
== Our Responsibilities

The Fedora Council is committed to enforcing this Fedora Code of Conduct in a fair and impartial manner so that Fedora community members are able to participate in the Fedora Project and its associated activities in a safe and respectful environment.
To achieve this, the Council has delegated responsibility to a xref:committee.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct Committee] for clarifying and interpreting the standards of acceptable behavior, responding to and investigating reports of behavior that is not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct and determining appropriate and fair corrective action in response.
The Committee will perform these functions along with the Red Hat Legal team, as appropriate.

Within their respective areas of participation Fedora Community members have the right in their sole discretion and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Fedora Code of Conduct.
Those Fedora Community members are expected to exercise these rights in alignment with the Fedora Code of Conduct.


[[scope]]
== Scope

This Fedora Code of Conduct applies in all online and offline project spaces and in all online and offline spaces where an individual is representing the project, its community, or is acting as a community member.

Examples of acting as a community member include:

\&#42; Posting to a Fedora mailing list,
\&#42; Filing a bug with Fedora,
\&#42; Participating in official Fedora communication channels (i.e. Fedora Discussion, Fedora Chat/Matrix)
\&#42; Contributing to the Fedora Project in any form
\&#42; Using an official project email address
\&#42; Posting via an official social media account
\&#42; Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
\&#42; Speaking for Fedora or its subprojects at a public event or online video
\&#42; Working in a Fedora or related booth or table at an event
\&#42; Participating in a Fedora or related technical meetup
\&#42; Serving as an elected or appointed leader in Fedora, including being a member of the Fedora Council


[[reporting]]
== Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of behavior inconsistent with this code may be reported by contacting the Fedora project by filing a private Fedora Code of Conduct ticket at https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue.
If the incident occurs at an event, the local event staff should be contacted in addition to opening a ticket.

Individuals without access to https://pagure.io/CoC/new_issue may send an email to the following address: codeofconduct@fedoraproject.org.
This email will be converted into a private Fedora Code of Conduct ticket by the xref:committee.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct Committee].

All reports will be kept confidential.
When we discuss incidents with anyone we will anonymize details as much as we can.
This means that the identities of all involved parties will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise or we are required to make disclosures under the law. Additionally, in some cases we may need to disclose this information to other parties at Red Hat.
Fedora is not a separate legal entity and therefore has to comply with all requirements imposed upon Red Hat.

Upon our review/investigation of the reported incident, we will determine what action is appropriate based on this Code and its clarifying statements.
An incident review will include communication with the reporter and the individual being reported, and an opportunity for both parties to provide an account of the incident.

All complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response.
Failure to follow this Code may result in actions including, but not limited to, warnings, temporary suspension, and in extreme circumstances, banning from the Fedora Project.
Please note, while we take all concerns/reported incidents raised seriously, we will use our discretion to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents.

[[retaliation]]
=== Our Stance on Retaliation

The Fedora Project is committed to ensuring that community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative consequences.
We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports a potential violation of this Fedora Code of Conduct or assists in its investigation.

[[protection-from-retaliation]]
==== Protection for Reporters and Participants

No one should face threats, harassment, discrimination, or any other form of retaliation for:

\&#42; Making a good faith report of behavior they believe violates this Fedora Code of Conduct.
\&#42; Participating in the investigation of a Fedora Code of Conduct report, including serving as a witness or providing information.
This protection explicitly extends to members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee in the execution of their duties.

'Good faith' means that you honestly believe the information you are providing is accurate, even if an investigation does not ultimately confirm the violation.

Acts of retaliation are serious violations of this Fedora Code of Conduct.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will address any confirmed instance of retaliation with appropriate corrective action, consistent with the enforcement of other Fedora Code of Conduct violations.
If you believe you are being retaliated against, please report it to the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee using the same reporting channels outlined in the 'Reporting and Enforcement' section.

[[false-reports]]
==== Addressing False Reports

We expect all community members to act responsibly when making reports.
The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will investigate all reports.
If the Committee determines, after thorough investigation, that a report was intentionally made with false information and with malicious intent (for example, to harass or silence someone), this action itself will be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.
An unsubstantiated report, when made in good faith, is not considered a false report.

= Clarifying Notes and Statements
Marie Nordin; Justin Wheeler; Fedora Council; Fedora community
v2.1, 2026-01-15
:page-aliases: project::coc-clarifying.adoc

The xref:index.adoc[Fedora Code of Conduct] (CoC) outlines our shared values and standards.
However, applying these high-level principles to specific situations requires clarity.
The Fedora Code of Conduct and its associated documents are “living documents.”
They will change over time as the Fedora community changes.
This supplemental document serves as an extension of the main policy, to provide additional background and clarification to the Fedora CoC.
It ensures that enforcement is consistent and that community members understand how the Fedora CoC applies to real-world scenarios, including event visibility and the protections afforded to those who report violations.


[[visibility]]
== Visibility and Awareness

A Code of Conduct is only effective if the community is aware of it and understands the reporting procedures.
To ensure this transparency, the following standards apply to all Fedora operations:

\&#42; \&#42;Digital Presence\&#42;:
The Fedora Code of Conduct and its associated documents must be linked in the footer of all major Fedora websites and, where possible, in other project communications.

\&#42; \&#42;Event Prominence\&#42;:
All events must prominently display the Fedora Code of Conduct.
Organizers must publish event-specific notes, including designated points of contact.

\&#42; \&#42;In-Person Reporting\&#42;:
If an event supports in-person reporting, the specific process for doing so must be clearly and prominently displayed.

\&#42; \&#42;Physical Signage\&#42;:
In-person events organized by Fedora must provide physical copies of the Fedora Code of Conduct or display clear signage regarding it for attendees.

\&#42; \&#42;Online Events\&#42;:
Virtual events must display a link to the Fedora Code of Conduct prominently on the event home page.

\&#42; \&#42;Registration Acknowledgement\&#42;:
Where the platform allows, online events should require attendees to agree to abide by the Fedora Code of Conduct as a mandatory step in the registration process.


[[adapting-contributor]]
== Why was the word “contributor” from the Contributor Covenant adapted when it was adapted for Fedora?

We need a Code of Conduct that speaks to everyone who interacts with our community.
Many of us may understand the word “contributor” to encompass everyone from a mailing list participant, forum poster, bug reporter, documentarian, designer, developer, etc., but not everyone understands it this way.
Additionally, many of our events are attended by users.
Speaking about the community is a more clear definition of the individuals covered in this Code.


[[retaliation]]
== Rationale for Retaliation Clause (v2.1)

This update codifies a zero-tolerance stance on retaliation to ensure community members feel safe and empowered to report concerns without fear of negative consequences.
Any confirmed act of retaliation is considered a serious, standalone violation of the Fedora CoC and will be met with appropriate corrective action.
The new section explicitly extends protections to reporters, witnesses, and Fedora Code of Conduct Committee members acting in good faith.
Additionally, it distinguishes between unsubstantiated good-faith claims and malicious false reporting, establishing the latter as a violation to preserve the integrity of the enforcement process.

As of version 2.1, the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee has explicitly codified our stance on retaliation to close a critical gap in community safety.
It was determined that for the Fedora CoC to be truly effective, reporters must feel empowered to come forward without fear of professional or social backlash.
Silence caused by fear of retribution undermines the health of the entire project.


= Fedora Code of Conduct Committee
:page-aliases: project::coc-committee.adoc

The Code of Conduct Committee consists of the Fedora Project Leader, the Fedora Community Architect, and Fedora community members.
Members of the Code of Conduct Committee will be provided with incident response training and guidelines around Fedora’s xref:index.adoc\&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement[Code of Conduct].


[[members]]
== Members

The current Code of Conduct Committee is comprised of:

\&#42; Jef Spaleta
(xref:council::fpl.adoc[Fedora Project Leader])
\&#42; Justin Wheeler
(xref:council::fca.adoc[Fedora Community Architect])
\&#42; Jona Azizaj
(xref:dei:roles:council-advisor.adoc[DEI Advisor])
\&#42; Dave Cantrell
(Fedora Council \&amp; FESCo member)
\&#42; Ankur Sinha
(Fedora community member)
\&#42; Chris Onoja Idoko
(Fedora community member)


[[responsibilities]]
== Responsibilities of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee

The Fedora Code of Conduct Committee will:

\&#42; Accept, acknowledge, and investigate reports of possible violations of the Code of Conduct from community members and/or moderators.
This will include communications with people who submit reports, reported persons, witnesses, and Red Hat Legal, as appropriate.
This will also involve communications with other members of the Committee by text or video call to deliberate and resolve reports.
Additional details about the reporting and response processes are documented on the xref:index.adoc\&#35;_reporting_and_enforcement[Reporting Process Information page].
\&#42; In cases where a Code of Conduct violation has occurred, determine what action should be taken by the Fedora Project.
These will typically take the form of remedial guidance, a set of consequences for the reported person, and/or possible recommendations for new policies or rules for the Fedora Project.
\&#42; Accept and acknowledge requests for clarifications about the Code of Conduct, and provide a response once any necessary communications and deliberations are complete.
\&#42; Make reporting as appropriate about incidents, including an annual report summarizing incidents over the last year.
\&#42;\&#42; This report will be statistical in nature to illustrate the process is functioning.
\&#42;\&#42; Past reports can be found under the https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/tag/code-of-conduct/[Code of Conduct tag] on the Community Blog.


[[adding-removing]]
== Adding or Removing Members to the Code of Conduct Committee

The Fedora Project Leader and Fedora Community Architect are members of the Code of Conduct Committee, regardless of who holds these roles.
Ideally, the Committee should have at least three members at all times, and no more than seven.
The Fedora Council will be notified of all changes in membership to the Fedora Conduct Committee.
Adding and removing members to the Committee will happen from time to time for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:

\&#42; Particular Community members’ interest in maintenance of Fedora community health
\&#42; A Committee member no longer has the time or desire to maintain Committee responsibilities
\&#42; A Committee member fails to uphold the Code of Conduct Committee Commitments
\&#42; Disengagement or absence in Committee activities lasting beyond one Fedora Linux release cycle (i.e. ≥4 months)

[[adding]]
=== Adding a Member to the Code of Conduct Committee

To add a member to the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee:

\&#42; Current members of the Code of Conduct Committee or the Fedora Council identifies a prospective member and obtains interest in and commitment to participation, then files an issue proposing the member’s nomination.
\&#42; The Code of Conduct Committee reviews the nomination to determine eligibility.
Suitability will be determined by evaluation of the nominee’s behavior and track record of interactions in the Fedora community.
\&#42; If the nomination is accepted, the Committee invites the nominee to join the Code of Conduct Committee in a formal communication.
This invitation must include the xref:\&#35;commitments[Code of Conduct Committee Commitments] that members must agree to follow to ensure Fedora’s Code of Conduct is managed fairly and in a confidential manner.
\&#42; If the nomination is rejected, the Committee sends a notification of the rejection.
A rejected nominee will be eligible for renomination after two release cycles.
\&#42; Upon acceptance of the invitation and acknowledgement and agreement to the xref:\&#35;commitments[Code of Conduct Committee Commitments], Fedora will provide the new member with Code of Conduct incident management training.
\&#42; Addition of the new member to Code of Conduct incident tracker and documentation.

[[removing]]
=== Removing a Member from the Code of Conduct Committee

The process to remove a member of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee is notice from:

\&#42; The member to the Committee that they intend to step down, or
\&#42; The Committee to the member that they have been removed, and why they have been removed.

Followed by removal of the individual from the CoC incident tracker and documentation.


[[commitments]]
== Fedora Code of Conduct Committee Commitments

Members of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee involved in investigating reports and making recommendations for resolution of Code of Conduct violations are required to uphold the following principles, ensuring that bias, lack of confidentiality and conflicts of interest do not impact the outcome of a Code of Conduct determination.

\&#42;\&#42;I agree to adhere to the Fedora Code of Conduct, in both letter and spirit, and acknowledge that violating the Code could result in removal from the Committee.\&#42;\&#42;

\&#42;\&#42;I agree to keep the process, any facts I learn, and any evidence I review confidential, and agree to discuss them only with individuals who are part of the process\&#42;\&#42;
(e.g. Fedora Code of Conduct Committee members, Red Hat Legal, or other designated individuals).

\&#42;\&#42;I will recuse myself if I cannot be fair and impartial in an individual case, due to my personal involvement with the parties involved.\&#42;\&#42;
If I have questions about recusal, I will consult the Fedora Community Architect and/or the Fedora Project Leader.

\&#42;\&#42;I agree that I will review Code of Conduct reports, conduct investigations, and make recommendations fairly and impartially.\&#42;\&#42;

\&#42;\&#42;I will review the reports and deliberate only in confidential sessions, with the outcome to be shared only with the parties and others as determined on a need-to-know basis.\&#42;\&#42;
(e.g. system administrators, moderators, or project leads.)

\&#42;\&#42;I will respect the process and outcome, recognizing that the Committee decision is the product of the Code of Conduct Committee, even if I do not personally agree, my recommendations are rejected, or I am part of the minority.\&#42;\&#42;

Please respond with acknowledgement that you have reviewed these commitments and agree to follow them in your role as a member of the Fedora Code of Conduct Committee.
