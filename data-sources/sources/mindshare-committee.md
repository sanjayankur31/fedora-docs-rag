Mindshare Teams are focused on helping our community grow both the
number of users and contributors. The teams in Mindshare are each
focused on a different aspect of this goal. The [Mindshare
Committee](mindshare.xml) fosters communication amongst the Mindshare
teams and helps facilitate Council strategy.

- [**Fedora Community Operations (CommOps)**](commops:ROOT:index.xml)
  --- Community Operations (CommOps) provides tools, resources, and
  utilities for different sub-projects of Fedora to improve effective
  communication.

- [**Fedora Docs**](fedora-docs:ROOT:index.xml) --- The group behind
  this very documentation site. Includes contributors\' guidelines to
  Fedora Docs.

- [**Ambassadors**](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors) ---
  Ambassadors are the representatives of Fedora.

- [**Design**](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design) --- The Fedora
  Design Team is Fedora's in-house design agency. We provide artwork,
  user experience, usability, and general design services to the Fedora
  project.

- [**Web Sites**](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites) --- The
  Fedora Websites initiative aims to improve Fedora's image and to
  create the best possible interface for users and contributors on the
  Internet.

- [**Fedora Badges**](badges:ROOT:index.xml) --- The group behind Fedora
  Badges --- a fun website built to recognize contributors to the Fedora
  Project, help new and existing Fedora contributors find different ways
  to get involved, and encourage the improvement of Fedora's
  infrastructure.

Advocates are passionate contributors who want to participate in
community events, represent Fedora and help grow the user and
contributor community. Advocates are people who love spreading knowledge
about their area of interest in Fedora. Many advocates also organize
release parties where they share information about What's new in Fedora.
Advocates also help new contributors join and hack on any of the
subprojects at meetups and Fedora Activity Days (FADs). Advocates come
from all parts of the project and represent contributors from all areas,
technical and non-technical.

Organize Fedora participation at events

- Foster Fedora contributors and encourage contribution and usage

- Promote Fedora and cross-community interaction

- Hold calendar events like release parties

- Promote Fedora technology at local user groups with talks etc.

Fedora Advocates tend to be people who are:

- already contributors and users of Fedora.

  Advocates are adding to their current contribution, not starting out
  with Fedora. This allows you to focus on community building in your
  area of expertise and interest. If you're brand new to the project,
  becoming an Advocate is most likely not a good first step. Start with
  contribution in other areas first.

- friendly and approachable.

  They like working with and talking to others, especially one-on-one in
  person or electronically. They realize that people are the key element
  of successful Open Source projects. Everything that we do --- events,
  budgets, swag, blogging --- it's all done to make personal connections
  with folks who either want to use or contribute to Fedora.

- wanting to lead a regional or locally focused community or start one.

  You should be eager and happy to work with Fedora Ambassadors to learn
  more about the project which you may not have contributed to before.

- the fabric of the community outreach effort.

  You are expected to collaborate and work with people in your local
  area, including colleges, universities, professional groups or
  meetups, and other places where like-minded individuals tend to
  congregate. You are the face of Fedora in your area.

Joining the Advocates is super-easy. **Just hold an event.** Really,
that's it. Details on how to do that and advice for getting started are
below.

You should also consider joining these two mailing lists:

- The [Ambassadors Mailing
  list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/ambassadors@lists.fedoraproject.org/).

  This list is where the ambassador and advocate groups talk and plan
  events. Events are announced, planned and improved on this list. This
  list helps you know what is going on that you might want to help with
  and shares ideas you might want to copy and modify for your area.
  Talking to a local Ambassador directly although a nice approach puts
  you in contact with one person who can be busy. By talking to the
  whole community you increase your chance of help and collaboration.

- The [Mindshare-Announce
  list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/mindshare-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/).

  This low volume list will help you know what is going on in Fedora
  that relates to marketing and community growth. The Mindshare
  committee, which approves event requests also posts their meeting
  minutes here.

:::: note
::: title
:::

Once you've done your first event, we'll add you to the list of
advocates by putting you into the advocate's FAS group, and you will be
awarded with the fabulous [Fedora Advocate
Badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/fedora-advocate).
::::

Make your first projects small ones that are well-defined. Many
advocates start out by:

- holding a Fedora Calendar Event such as a Release Party.

  This will give you the chance to learn the process of hosting events
  and communicating with the Ambassadors and Mindshare.

- joining an existing event and helping out.

  This is easy to do if your monitoring the mailing list.

- teaming up with a Fedora Ambassador.

  It's great to have Ambassadors by your side, they can help you plan
  and execute your event. They also have lots of experience with what
  works and what doesn't and they may be familiar with different parts
  of the project than you are.

In all cases, think about what your community is interested in and
focused on. Fedora has multiple editions and objectives and they are all
great technologies and great stories to tell. Pick the one that makes
the most sense to your and your community. For some people, focussing on
the work of a specific subproject makes the most sense. If your
community is focused on a specific language stack, etc., talk about
that.

When you're ready to hold an event, you need to do a few simple things:

1.  Open a ticket in the [Mindshare Issue
    Tracker](https://pagure.io/mindshare/issues) and let people know
    about your event. If your event needs financial or swag support (see
    below) this is a crucial (and mandatory) first step.

2.  Send an email to the ambassadors mailing list and let the world know
    what you're planning. Ambassadors and others may have suggestions or
    advice that can improve your event. This also lets you find others
    who may want to help you with your event.

3.  Hold your event. **Be awesome!**

4.  Write an event report. An event report lets the community know what
    happened and how it went. Ideally your report will be shared on the
    Fedora Community Blog, but posting it on your own blog and the
    Fedora Planet is fine too. If your event requires financial or swag
    support (see below), this is mandatory. Update your event ticket
    with the link of the event report.

5.  \"Lather. Rinse. Repeat.\" as your shampoo bottle says. Do it again
    and again and keep the momentum going.

The goal of an event is the spread knowledge and attract users and
contributors to Fedora. We realize that sometimes you need swag (such as
stickers, buttons and pins) or money to help make this possible. The
Advocate role is designed with the idea of easy to accomplish events in
mind. Our Fedora Ambassadors (which you are free to join) also do larger
more involved events.

Therefore, Advocates are limited in what they can request. When you are
planning for an event you should think about using Fedora Stickers (we
have lots of designs and will typically send 50 stickers) and a budget
of \$100 or less. If you need more, we encourage you to team up with a
Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a larger
budget. We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget that make the
most sense for you, your area, and the event, however we tend to
restrict the money to no more than \$25 being spent on travel and none
being used to produced swag. The balance is typically spent on food,
meeting space, etc.

To request support do this:

1.  Make sure the ticket you opened with Mindshare above contains your
    budget request and is detailed as to how you want to use it. There
    is a template in the [Mindshare
    Repository](https://pagure.io/mindshare/new_issue) to help you. You
    need to select it from the `Type` drop down. The template is named
    **advocate**. Please use it.

2.  Wait for Mindshare to make a decision. Our goal is to decide on
    events within one calendar week. However, you should have as much
    lead time as possible as there may be questions from the committee
    or unforeseeable delays. Shipping also takes time, so allow a lot of
    it, especially if the import process in your country is long.

    Mindshare will typically respond with:

    - Approved: GO FOR IT! Your event is approved. **We want you to be
      successful.**

    - Questions/Suggestions: We are a bit confused or have some
      questions and ideas. We may also suggest different ways to use
      your budget or that you work with an Ambassador. In some cases we
      will want to make sure you're well versed in the technology you
      want to represent. Respond to these concerns to get a final
      decision.

    - Declined: There are various reasons why we can't support your
      event. We hope to never have to decline an event and instead that
      we can work with you to make it a success.

3.  If you've asked for swag, please submit a **swag-shipment** request
    in the [Fedora Budget
    Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-budget/issues) using the provided
    template. Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is generally
    not stored in your country. Most of the delay is to allow time for
    customs processing in your country, not shipping.

4.  Do It! Hold the event and save your receipts.

5.  Write your report. Link your report to your ticket.

6.  Submit a reimbursement request to the [Fedora Budget
    Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-budget/issues) using the provided
    template. Reimbursements are typically paid within 2 weeks.

The work of Advocates is often featured in the Mindshare newsletters and
hence the event report holds a significant amount of importance. The
report is a general summary of an event which gives the project an idea
of what's going on and reports on successes as well as lessons learned.

Reporting can be done in many ways. Here's are a couple of commonly used
methods for sharing the event report with the community:

- **Community Blog** (a.k.a. **CommBlog**): You can [sign into the
  Community Blog WordPress
  site](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/wp-login.php) using your
  FAS account credentials. Once inside, you can create a new post where
  you can draft your experience. After you are done, follow the steps in
  the [guide on publishing articles on the
  CommBlog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/writing-community-blog-article/).
  Here's an example of a [Fedora 27 release party blog
  post](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-27-release-party-at-taipei/).

- **Your own Blog** : If you have been maintaining your own blog, you
  can post it there as well. To extend the reach of audience, Advocates
  may syndicate their blog to Fedora Planet. For more information [check
  out this \'how
  to\'.](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Planet?rd=Planet_HowTo)

Comment on your issue in the [mindshare repo with a link to your event
report.](https://pagure.io/mindshare/issues)

Part of keeping Fedora a vibrant, healthy community is bringing new
contributors on board. One way we can do this is to have our presence at
events focus on recruiting contributors. Open source events are a great
way to reach people who are interested in joining a project.

The idea behind this plan is not to replace the [people-focused
workflow](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-join-is-trying-a-new-people-focused-workflow-for-newcomers/)
that the Fedora Join SIG uses. What we want is to create a \"funnel\" of
potential contributors that the Join SIG can help bring into the Fedora
community.

In order to give people a focused area, we highlight a few teams that
are a [current area of focus](current_focus).

The primary goal of Fedora's presence at conferences and other large
events should be contributor recruitment. This does not mean that we
can't do general messaging, but that will not be the focus or how
success is measured. We should, of course, continue to speak to existing
users about the shiny new technical features in the latest release.

The \"How to organize an event\" page will soon be updated with specific
guidance.

We encourage teams that are looking for new contributors to submit
Fedora Magazine articles describing their current work, and areas they
need help with. As an example, see Adam Šamalík's [Contribute to Fedora
Magazine
article](https://fedoramagazine.org/contribute-to-fedora-magazine-2/).
In addition we can use social media channels to promote these articles.
Teams can work with the [Fedora Design team](https://pagure.io/design)
to create images that can be used to promote recruitment. \* Committee
Procedures

To make the production and creating of swag more efficient, the
Mindshare Committee has empowered the [Fedora Community Action and
Impact Coordinator
(FCAIC)](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/fcaic/) to produce
and create swag as needed to keep our inventory full. Swag items and use
will be approved by Mindshare, in general, and then the FCAIC/others
will fulfill needs for the various events based on their best judgement
in concert with the event owner/coordinator. The FCAIC will consult with
Mindshare if there are questions.

Anyone can open a Mindshare ticket or contact the FCAIC to suggest swag
items. Event owners/coordinators can request specific swag when
proposing their events. No promises are made that specific swag items
will be produced.

The goal of centralized swag production is to ensure high quality and
reduced costs (through larger print runs). We tend to use swag that is
project themed and focused except for large events or special needs.

As an example, this process looks like this for the Fedora Booklets in
[Mindshare Ticket #105](https://pagure.io/mindshare/issue/105).

1.  Mindshare makes a decision about the use of the booklets in general
    and about Fedora providing them

2.  FCAIC/others arrange to have them printed and in-stock or on-demand
    for use

3.  Event Owners suggest when they will be useful at their events

4.  AMAZING EVENTS!

The following typically need to be done to add a new member to the
committee:

- Update the [Mindshare FAS
  Group](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/mindshare)

- Update the [Mindshare Pagure
  Group](https://pagure.io/group/fedora-mindshare)

- Update the [Mindshare Docs
  Page](https://pagure.io/mindshare/tree/master) that lists the members

- Update the meeting script above

- Add the person to the calendar invite

# Purpose: {#_purpose}

Fedora has been participating in fedora has been a participant of GSoC,
GSoD and Outreachy. All the three are program which runs throughout the
year and need attention of a dedicated person.

# Can I join in as a representative? {#_can_i_join_in_as_a_representative}

Mindshare sees value in having **selected** seat assigned to a someone
who will be taking care of the following responsibilities.

- Making sure GSoC, GSoD and Outreachy applications are submitted on
  time.

- Coordinating with GSoC, GSoD and Outreachy admins for common work like
  intern's intro interviews, weekly/biweekly/monthly reports on their
  work, community involvement, etc.

- Identify and segregate projects suggested on mentored project issues
  for GSoC/Outreachy/GSoD.

- Explore similar programs that can fit in mentored projects and see if
  it's feasible (like rails girls).

- Market and spread news of summer coding programs with other SIG
  members to attract more participation.

- Be one point of contact for communication around relevant topics.

- Be involved in mindshare committee with ticket approvals, decision
  making, and other things that mindshare seat is expected to do.

- Attend weekly meetings (if possible).

- Retain students and effectively show the students the pathway to be
  long term Fedora contributor.

# Support the current representative {#_support_the_current_representative}

This is an **Selected** seat which means that people who are interested
in working as mentored project rep can actually help the current
represenative to learn \"how to do things right\"

The Mindshare Committee represents the outreach teams in Fedora and
provides an umbrella for other non-coding teams. Mindshare has
established a Quarterly Report to help round up announcements,
information, and updates from these teams. This page holds documentation
on our process to gather information, format, and publish the report.

All teams on the Mindshare \"side\" of the Fedora ecosystem are welcome
to participate. Teams which have active representatives on the committee
are strongly suggested to contribute to the report.

Current list of teams and how to contact them for info:

- Ambassadors (Community Outreach Revamp Team/FCAIC)

- CommOps (Rep)

- Council (Rep)

- Design (Rep)

- Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (Discourse)

- Docs (Rep)

- Globalization (<https://pagure.io/i18n/issues>)

- Join SIG (<join@lists.fedoraproject.org>)

- Magazine (Discourse)

- Marketing (Discourse)

- Mentored Projects (Rep)

- Mindshare (This is us!)

- Podcast (IRC/Element)

- Translations (<trans@lists.fedoraproject.org>)

- Websites & Apps (Discourse)

A ticket is opened on the Mindshare pagure to track progress for each
report (i.e. \"Q1 Mindshare Report - January, February, March 2022\")
and is triaged with the tag \"quarterly-report\". The owner of the
ticket is the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator(FCAIC).

The report is written up and edited in a HackMD file. The Mindshare
Committee has team space on HackMD to store these and other Mindshare
related working documents.

A template has been created in HackMD for ease of reproducibility. To
access the template you need to be a part of the Mindshare team space on
HackMD. How to find the template:

- Click the \"...​\" drop down menu

- Click \"+ Insert from template\"

- Choose \"Mindshare Quarterly Report\"

- Click \"Use this template\".

Once the ticket and template have been set up, additions are welcome to
be made through the quarter.

The last month of the quarter, two Mindshare Committee meetings will be
used in some capacity to gather information from the Representatives and
other members of Mindshare. Any teams that are not represented on
Mindshare should be contacted with at least two weeks notice to provide
any additions.

Once all the information from the various teams has been gathered, the
FCAIC does any final edits and moves the report into the CommBlog
wordpress. This should be done the last week of the quarter. Make sure
to follow the \"Writing a Community Blog post\" process outlined on the
CommBlog. Request that the CommBlog editors publish the post within a
week or two of the last quarter end.

After the report is published to the CommBlog, a link should be added to
the corresponding ticket. That ticket can then be closed as complete and
a new ticket for the upcoming quarter should be opened immediately. The
cycle starts again!

As a major steering committee under the Fedora Council, Mindshare is
responsible for selecting a representative that covers the community
aspects of the Fedora Project. This person is responsible for
representing Mindshare as a collective and not as a single voice. They
will be required to work with all of the various groups that collaborate
with Mindshare and act as a liaison between these groups and the
Council. The role will require a fair amount of time investment and good
communication skills.

The following responsibilities and duties are delegated to the Mindshare
representative.

To Fedora Council:

- Participate in two to three Council hackfests a year (If these events
  happen).

- Participate in two to three Council meetings a month as representative
  of the Mindshare committee (If these events happen).

- Identify synergies and collaboration opportunities with Fedora Council
  responsibilities, Mindshare objectives, and the Fedora Community.

- Any other normal functions of a Fedora Council member

To the Mindshare Committee:

- Participate in two to three Mindshare meetings a month.

- Share periodic updates and insight on Council tasks and priorities
  back to the team.

- Listen to the needs, concerns, and hopes of the Fedora Community and
  relay them to the Mindshare Committee.

The representative will serve in this role for two release cycles. They
may also step down before that time or the Council or Mindshare may wish
to replace them. Careful consideration of time commitments should be
taken when making the selection, and the Council, Mindshare, and the
representative should evaluate their effectiveness as a group on a
fairly regular basis. In the event that the representative to Mindshare
needs to step down, they should make the Committee aware and the process
to choose a new rep will begin. In the event that the Mindshare
Committee or the Council wish to make a change in representative, a
thorough explanation of why will be required, and each situation will be
handled on a case by case basis. In the event that the Council wants to
change the rep, Mindshare Committee will review and make a final
decision, and vice versa.

This section explains how the representative is nominated and confirmed.
The selection process documented below is initiated when a rotation of
representatives is motioned by the existing representative, the
Mindshare committee, or the Fedora Council.

There will be a two-week nomination period for potential
representatives. Nominees can be self-nominated or nominated by other
members of the Mindshare Committee with their consent. Nominees are
required to be members of the Mindshare Committee and should have a
basic understanding of various Fedora sub-projects, and have sufficient
time to perform the responsibilities required.

In the event that there are no nominees, the Mindshare committee will
work with the Council to broaden the search message and request more
time. Should no nominees be found after that, the role will rotate among
existing Mindshare members until the next representative is identified.

After the nomination period expires, Mindshare will discuss candidates
in a public meeting. A meeting discussion provides an opportunity for
the team to weigh in and share another context. In the unlikely event
that more than two nominees are interested in the representative role,
we will allow for an additional week to discuss and come to a resolution
as a Committee.

The selected person and the Council will be notified, and the person
will start serving in that role as soon as possible. \# LimeSurvey

LimeSurvey (formerly PHPSurveyor) is a free and open source on-line
statistical survey web app written in PHP based on a MySQL, SQLite,
PostgreSQL or MSSQL database, distributed under the GNU General Public
License.

Fedora Project pays for a [limesurvey
account](https://fedoraproject.limequery.com/index.php/admin) which we
use for surveys in the community.

# Organize a survey using Fedora's LimeSurvey {#_organize_a_survey_using_fedoras_limesurvey}

If you want to use limesurvey to do a survey, you don't need the backend
access. Please use mindshare repository and open the ticket with

SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
::::

This page holds COVID-19 related guidance for in person events. This
applies to Fedorans who are receiving Fedora funding related to events.
By receiving funds related to in person events, you are agreeing to the
Terms posted at the bottom of this page. The state of the virus is
ever-changing, so take this information as a general guideline and not
hard fact. Feel free to direct any questions to the {team_name}. Contact
the {team_name} through chat in
[#mindshare:fedoraproject.org]({team_synch_communication}) or by
[opening a ticket]({team_issue_tracker}) on the Mindshare repo.

To learn more about requesting funds for Fedora related events, take a
look at the [{team_name} docs](mindshare-committee::index.xml).

For the purpose of this page, an event is any internal (Fedora
contributors), external (collaborations, partners, neighbor
communities), or a mix of both internal/external gathering of people
that takes place in person. This is for all Fedora related events
regardless of size, location/region, audience (internal, external), or
type (Fedora hosted events or third party events).

This is the part that is ever-changing. As we have witnessed, COVID-19
seems to spread, then we suppress it some, and then evolves and spreads
again. Hopefully we will soon see developments that can neutralize
COVID-19, or significantly decrease the severity. Until that time, we
have to remain flexible.

This means evaluating event funding requests on a case-by-case basis.
The Fedora Project must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
for events that we sponsor and/or fund.

In order for the {team_name} to make a decision about event related
funding the following information will be required along with usual
info. Please submit this information when [opening an event related
ticket]({team_issue_tracker}) on the {team_name} repo. See below for
details:

1.  Event website

2.  Specific COVID-19 safety measures that the Event will be
    implementing

3.  Approximate number of attendees

4.  Country where event is taking place

5.  Will your travel to/from the event bring you across a Country
    border?

6.  Local official COVID-19 guidance

Every event is encouraged to follow the highest possible safety
standards for the protection of all participants. For example:

- Adherence to third party or venue safety measures that are required.

- Understanding of and adherence to government requirements.

- Vaccination requirements.

- Communication of [Terms](#terms) to participants of Fedora organized
  events

Every individual should be aware of and are encouraged to follow the
highest possible safety standards for the protection of all
participants. For example:

- Adherence to requirements related to traveling and any costs
  associated (i.e. testing, isolation periods, documentation, etc.).

- If you become sick with COVID-19 near the time of the funded event,
  you must test negative before traveling to or participating in any
  Fedora related events.

By receiving funding related to in-person events, you agree to the
following:

1.  While onsite, you agree to comply with all laws and rules with
    regard to public health including social distancing protocols and
    face mask requirements.

2.  You acknowledge the health risks associated with the novel
    coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, and the risk of exposure or
    infection by COVID-19.

3.  Neither Fedora, the event venue, the event organizer, or any of
    their respective parents, affiliates, sponsors, shareholders,
    employees, agents, officers, directors, successors, or assignees
    will be liable for any injury or illness, however caused, arising
    from, or in any way relate to COVID-19 in connection with the event.

4.  You assume any and all risk, whatsoever, related to any Fedora or
    Fedora-related event, and release and discharge Fedora, their
    sponsors, and their agents from any liability to the fullest extent
    allowed by the law.

Release Parties are an informal gathering of community members hosted by
Fedora to celebrate a new release. Release parties are a great way to
help spread Fedora in your local area and provide an opportunity for
Fedora users in your area to come together as a community.

Release parties can be casual events with a few people meeting in a
coffee shop or larger events with numerous people in attendance, planned
activities, and speakers.

There are many things you can do at a Release Party. A typical release
party will have the following:

1.  **Talks/Presentations**: Typically talks at release parties are ones
    that introduce features in the new release of Fedora. If you're not
    sure what are the most interesting and important check the [Talking
    points]({FWIKI}/Fedora_29_talking_points).

2.  **Question and Answer session**: Host a session where people can
    come and ask questions about Fedora. This can be a great way to help
    answer people's questions and learn what common questions are in the
    community. It is also an opportunity to help people with installs
    and upgrades. It is OK if you are not an expert. Make this an
    "audience participation" event and get everyone to help everyone,
    just like in the rest of Fedora. This is also a great time to show
    off the various ways to get help online.

3.  **Live USB Creation Station**: Have a machine with you that you can
    create Live USB images for people on the USB keys they provide. This
    can be a great way to send someone home with a Live Fedora image
    they can work with if they are hesitant to commit to an actual
    Fedora install.

These are just ideas. You are not required to do any or all of them.
Focus your party on your audience. For example, if you are hosting a
release party at work, have talks focused on the way you use Linux and
how that relates to Fedora.

*It is simple to host a Release Party*.

When you're ready, you need to do a few simple things:

1.  Post to the [#mindshare tag on Fedora
    Discussion]({team_asynch_communication}) and let the world know what
    you are planning. Ambassadors and others may have suggestions or
    advice that can improve your event. This also lets you find others
    who may want to help you with your event.

2.  Open a ticket in the [Mindshare issue tracker]({team_issue_tracker})
    and let people know about your event. If your event needs financial
    or swag support (see below), this is a mandatory step. Please use
    the *Release Party* template.

3.  Once your party is approved, do the following:

    a.  Add it to the [Events
        Fedocal](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/Events/), so
        others can find it.

    b.  Request a QR code to award the Release Party Attendee badge. You
        can do it by opening an issue at [Mindshare issue
        tracker]({team_issue_tracker}).

    c.  Put in a swag request ticket in the Event Requests repo (see
        below).

    d.  Finalize your plans and hold your party.

4.  After your party, write an event report. An event report lets the
    community know what happened and how it went. Ideally your report
    will be shared on the Fedora Community Blog, but posting it on your
    own blog and the Fedora Planet is fine too. If your event requires
    financial or swag support (see below), this is mandatory. These
    reports should help us understand what happened and how the party
    went. Ideas for what went well and what could be improved are
    welcome.

5.  If you have financial assistance approved, file a reimbursement
    ticket in the [Event Requests
    repository](https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests).

Release Parties and should be planned at least 30-40 days in advance. In
our experience, events planned with less lead time are generally less
successful. If you request swag, plan two weeks for shipping.

Follow the Getting Financial Assistance and Swag section
[here](ROOT:advocate.xml#_getting_swag_or_financial_support).

- **Community Blog** (a.k.a. **CommBlog**): You can [sign into the
  Community Blog WordPress site]({COMMBLOG}/wp-login.php) using your FAS
  account credentials. Once inside, you can create a new post where you
  can draft your experience. After you are done, follow the steps in the
  [guide on publishing articles on the
  CommBlog]({COMMBLOG}/writing-community-blog-article/). Here's an
  example of a [Fedora 27 release party blog
  post]({COMMBLOG}/fedora-27-release-party-at-taipei/).

- **Your own Blog**: If you have been maintaining your own blog, you can
  post it there as well. To extend the reach of audience, Advocates may
  syndicate their blog to Fedora Planet. For more information [check out
  this \'how to\']({FWIKI}/Planet).

Comment on your issue in the [Mindshare repo]({team_issue_tracker}) with
a link to your event report.

If you only need swag to help you hold an event, we have a fast-track
policy to help you out. Anyone can request swag for an event, you don't
have to be an Ambassador. If you are new to Fedora events, checkout our
[Advocate Program](ROOT:advocate.xml).

1.  Please open a Mindshare ticket in the [Mindshare
    Repository]({team_issue_tracker}). You need to select the
    **swag-only** template from the `Type` drop down. Please complete
    the fields required.

2.  Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

3.  Voting usually starts quickly. The ticket needs to get 2 +1s and no
    -1s in three days. When this happens, a committee member will update
    the ticket with an approved message.

4.  Open a **swag-shipment** request in the [Event Requests
    repo](https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests) using the
    provided template. Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is
    generally not stored in your country. Most of the delay is to allow
    time for customs processing in your country, not shipping.

5.  Hold your event!

6.  Write your event report

    Fedora Events are often featured in the Mindshare newsletters and
    hence the event report holds a significant amount of importance. The
    report is a general summary of an event which gives the project an
    idea of what's going on and reports on successes as well as lessons
    learned.

    Reporting can be done in many ways. Here's are a couple of commonly
    used methods for sharing the event report with the community:

    - **Community Blog** (a.k.a. **CommBlog**): You can [sign into the
      Community Blog WordPress site]({COMMBLOG}/wp-login.php) using your
      FAS account credentials. Once inside, you can create a new post
      where you can draft your experience. After you are done, follow
      the steps in the [guide on publishing articles on the
      CommBlog]({COMMBLOG}/writing-community-blog-article/). Here's an
      example of a [Fedora 27 release party blog
      post]({COMMBLOG}/fedora-27-release-party-at-taipei/).

    - **Your own Blog**: If you have been maintaining your own blog, you
      can post it there as well. To extend the reach of audience,
      Advocates may syndicate their blog to Fedora Planet. For more
      information [check out this \'how to\']({FWIKI}/Planet).

Comment on your issue in the [Mindshare repo]({team_issue_tracker}) with
a link to your event report.

Anyone can hold or attend a small Fedora-related event, you don't have
to be an Ambassador. A small event is one where the budget is under
\$150. The process is exactly the same as for our [Advocate
Program](ROOT:advocate.xml). It is summarized below:

1.  Please open a Mindshare ticket in the [Mindshare
    Repository]({team_issue_tracker}). You should use the **advocate**
    template from the `Type` drop down. Please complete the fields
    required.

    When you are planning for an event you should think about using
    Fedora stickers and similar swag along with a budget of \$150 or
    less. If you need more budget, we encourage you to team up with a
    Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a larger
    budget. We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget that make
    the most sense for you, your area, and the event.

2.  Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

3.  Voting usually starts very quickly. The ticket needs to get 2 +1s
    and no -1s in three days. When this happens, a committee member will
    update the ticket with an approved message.

4.  Open a **swag-shipment** request if you need swag for this event.
    Open the request in the [Event Requests
    repo](https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests) using the
    provided template. Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is
    generally not stored in your country. Most of the delay is to allow
    time for customs processing in your country, not shipping.

8.  Comment on your issue in the [Mindshare repo]({team_issue_tracker})
    with a link to your event report.

While anyone can hold or attend a medium Fedora-related event, these
events are typically done by experienced Fedora contributors and or
existing Fedora Ambassadors. A medium event is one where the budget is
under \$1000.

1.  Please open a Mindshare ticket in the [Mindshare
    Repository]({team_issue_tracker}). You should use the **advocate**
    template from the `Type` drop down. Please complete the fields
    required.

    When preparing your ticket, keep these things in mind:

    - Be clear in what you hope to accomplish and why the event is good
      for Fedora.

    - Help the {team_name} understand how you are qualified to help make
      this a success. You may want to talk about your experience, or
      contribution history.

    - Think about how you will use the budget and what kind of swag
      support, if any, will help you be successful. We like to see the
      budget spent directly on the event or attendance and not on swag
      production. If you need more budget, we encourage you to team up
      with a Fedora Ambassador have them sponsor the event and ask for a
      larger budget. We are open to you suggesting uses for your budget
      that make the most sense for you, your area, and the event.

2.  Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee.

3.  Voting usually starts very quickly. The ticket needs to get 3 +1s
    and no -1s in eleven days. When this happens, a committee member
    will update the ticket with an approved message. If all committee
    members vote sooner, the ticket can be approved sooner. The goal of
    the eleven day period is to ensure that we have at least one meeting
    during the discussion period (allowing for holidays, etc.).

4.  Open a **swag-shipment** request if you need swag for this event.
    Open the request in the [Event Requests
    repo](https://gitlab.com/fedora/mindshare/event-requests) using the
    provided template. Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as swag is
    generally not stored in your country. Most of the delay is to allow

    with a link to your event report.

While anyone can hold or attend a large Fedora-related event, these
events are typically done by experienced Fedora contributors and or
existing Fedora Ambassadors. A large event is one where the budget is
over \$1000 or the event is generally larger or more complicated.

1.  Please open a Mindshare ticket in the [Mindshare
    Repository]({team_issue_tracker}). You should use the **advocate**
    template from the `Type` drop down. Please complete the fields

2.  Monitor your ticket for questions from the Committee. These tickets
    will often attract questions from the Committee.

3.  Expect discussion about your ticket to start fairly quickly. Once
    all the questions are answered, a vote will be called for. The
    ticket needs to get 3 +1s and no -1s in eleven days. When this
    happens, a committee member will update the ticket with an approved
    message. If all committee members vote sooner, the ticket can be

8.  Comment on your issue in the [Mindshare repo]({team_issue_tracker})
    with a link to your event report. .Policies & Processes

This page documents the Event Report Policy for any event funded by the
Fedora Project. Every funded event requires an event report. This page
documents expected outcomes and consequences when an event organizer
does not write an event report.

Event reports more than 30 days (about a month) late result in the
following:

1.  The contributor is not reimbursed for event expenses until the
    report is complete.

2.  The contributor is unable to solely sponsor additional events or
    request swag.

Event reports more than 90 days (about 3 months) late result in the
following:

1.  All 30-day consequences listed previously.

2.  The contributor is not allowed to take a leadership position in
    organizing events until they provide the missing event report and
    [re-establish their activity](#reestablish-activity).

3.  The contributor is ineligible for advance funding for travel
    funding/requests until this is resolved.

After 120 days, the event report is no longer required as it probably
has limited value. Event reports more than 120 days (about four months)
late result in the following:

1.  All 90-day consequences listed previously.

2.  The contributor is not allowed to take a leadership position in
    organizing events until they [re-establish their
    activity](#reestablish-activity).

3.  The contributor is ineligible for any advance funding for travel
    funding/requests for one of the following, whichever is longer:

    a.  14 months from the date of the original event, **OR**

    b.  6 months from the date they have re-established their activity
        in the project.

4.  The contributor is removed from the roster of active
    [Advocates](ROOT:advocate.xml), if applicable.

5.  They are not allowed to officially represent the Fedora Project
    until they [re-establish their activity](#reestablish-activity) in
    the project.

Re-establishing activity is a conversation, not an algorithm. It is
generally met by being a helper at other people's events or otherwise
showing the {team_name} they are actively involved in Fedora SIGs or
other online events. The {team_name} strongly considers a person's
history and unique circumstances. :page-keywords: fedora, reimbursement,

This document outlines the current process for Fedora Project
contributors not employed by Red Hat to request and receive
reimbursement from Red Hat for pre-approved, project-related expenses.
These requests are known as **Fedora Reimbursement Requests (FRR)**.
Please follow the steps detailed here, as they reflect current Red Hat
policies and procedures.

Fedora Reimbursement Requests (FRRs) typically cover the following types
of pre-approved expenses:

- **Travel**: Airfare, train, or bus tickets.

- **Accommodation**: Hotel or hostel stays. Home-sharing services such
  as Airbnb are *NOT* allowed.

- **Other Specific Expenses**: Event registration fees. Visa application
  fees may be covered in extraordinary circumstances and with specific
  pre-approval.

Meals and local transport (e.g., metro, bus, taxi) are **NOT** eligible
for reimbursement through this program.
::::

Before starting the Fedora Reimbursement Request (FRR) process, please
ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Fedora Account System (FAS) account**: You must have an active FAS
  account. Experienced Fedora contributors typically already have this.

- **USD Reimbursement**: All reimbursements Red Hat issues are in **US
  Dollars (USD)** only, regardless of the currency in which you incurred
  expenses.

- **Tax Responsibility**: You are personally responsible for any tax
  obligations in your country of residence that may arise from receiving
  this reimbursement. Red Hat does not provide tax advice or handle
  individual tax liabilities.

This first stage must be completed **before** you incur any expenses
that you expect Red Hat to reimburse.

Before Red Hat can consider an FRR, your activity and associated funding
must be approved by an appropriate Fedora Project governance body. For
event-related expenses, this is typically the [Fedora Mindshare
Committee](mindshare-committee:ROOT:index.xml).

1.  Follow the current procedures outlined by the Fedora Mindshare
    Committee below to request sponsorship. These processes may be under
    review or restructuring, but they represent the publicly-known
    guidelines:

    - [Large Event
      Requests](mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/large.xml)

    - [Medium Event
      Requests](mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/medium.xml)

    - [Small Event
      Requests](mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/small.xml)

    - [Release Party
      Funding](mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/release-parties.xml)

    - [Swag-Only
      Requests](mindshare-committee:ROOT:events/requests/swag-only.xml)

2.  Once approved, you will use the public URL from the Mindshare
    Committee GitLab issue that documents this community approval and
    the budgeted amount.

**Keep this URL handy; you will need it later for your FRR.**

If your FRR includes funding for **travel** (such as flights, train, or
bus tickets) or **accommodation** (like hotel stays), you *must* also
obtain pre-approval from Red Hat's internal Business Entertainment and
Amenities Review (BEAR) team.

BEAR pre-approval is **not** required if your sponsorship only covers an
event registration fee and does not include any Fedora-funded travel or
accommodation.

**To obtain BEAR pre-approval**:

1.  You need to fill out the form in the {url-ospo-bear}\[Red Hat OSPO
    BEAR GitLab repository\]. This form asks for the following:

    - Your full, legal name; FAS username; preferred email.

    - Details about your employer (name, type such as government,
      commercial, self-employed).

    - Requested travel dates.

    - Estimates for your travel and accommodation costs in **US Dollars
      (USD)**. For airfare or rail, provide the total estimated cost.

    - Event details, including any conference fees if applicable.

    - Answers to compliance-related questions.

2.  Submit this form by creating a new **confidential** issue on the
    repository linked previously. Ensure you check the box to make the
    issue confidential.

3.  The Fedora Community Architect (FCA) will be notified of your
    request and will facilitate the internal review by Red Hat Legal.

4.  The FCA will communicate the outcome of the BEAR review (approved or
    rejected) to you. The BEAR approval is documented with a new comment
    in the request.

:::: important
::: title
:::

**Start Collecting Receipts Immediately!**

Once your funding is approved (by both the Fedora community and Red
Hat's BEAR team, if applicable), you must begin collecting **itemized
and dated receipts** for *every single expense* you intend to claim in
your FRR.

**Without proper itemized and dated receipts, Red Hat cannot reimburse
your expenses.** This is a strict requirement.
::::

This stage covers your participation in the approved activity and the
critical task of correctly documenting your expenses for the FRR.

Attend your conference, deliver your talk, or participate in the Fedora
activity as approved.

Proper receipts are the cornerstone of your reimbursement claim. Failure
to collect the correct type of receipts will prevent reimbursement.

:::: warning
::: title
:::

**No Itemized, Dated Receipt = No Reimbursement**

Red Hat's policy strictly requires that you provide an **itemized** AND
**dated** receipt for every expense.

- **Itemized Receipt**: The receipt must clearly list each individual
  item or service purchased.

  - For example, a hotel bill (folio) must show the nightly rate and any
    individual charges. A simple credit card transaction slip with a
    total amount is not sufficient.

- **Dated Receipt**: The receipt must clearly show the date the expense
  was incurred.

Credit card statements or bank transaction lists alone are **not
sufficient** because they are not itemized. Always ask for and retain
the detailed merchant receipt. Make sure to get a proper receipt for
transactions such as:

- **Airfare, train, or bus tickets**: E-tickets and booking
  confirmations that show payment and travel details usually suffice.

- **Hotel folios**: This is the final, itemized bill from the hotel at
  checkout.

- **Event registration fees**: Confirmation emails showing payment are
  typical.

- **Visa application fees**: An official receipt from the visa service
  is needed, if pre-approved in extraordinary circumstances.

Keep all physical receipts safe. It is a good practice to take clear
digital photos or scans of them as soon as you receive them.
::::

For most Fedora-funded events, you are required to write an event
report. This could be a blog post or a summary on Fedora Discussion.
Alternatively, you can share social media posts about your participation
and the event.

- Consult the Fedora Mindshare Committee's [Event Report
  Policy](mindshare-committee:ROOT:policy/events/reports.xml) for
  guidance.

- Publish your report. Keep the URL handy; you will need to provide this
  link when you submit your FRR.

:::: note
::: title
:::

Flock, the annual Fedora contributor conference, is exempt from this
mandatory reporting. However, sharing your experiences is still highly
encouraged!
::::

After your event is over, and you have gathered all your receipts and
prepared your event report, you can submit your FRR.

Red Hat issues all reimbursements via direct bank deposit and **only in
US Dollars (USD)**.

You will need to provide the following banking details accurately:

- **Your Full Legal Name**: This name must be exactly as it appears on
  your bank account.

- **Bank's Full Remit Address**: This is the complete legal address of
  your bank branch where your account is held.

- **Official Bank Proof Document**: This is a formal document from your
  bank that verifies your account details. Examples include a voided
  check (if common in your banking system) or an official letter or
  statement from your bank containing all the below details. It must
  clearly show:

  - Your full legal name as it appears on the account.

  - The bank's name and full remit address.

  - Your bank account number.

  - Relevant routing numbers (e.g., SWIFT/BIC code for international
    transfers, IBAN, ABA routing number, sort code, depending on your
    bank's location).

  - Ideally, it should also confirm the account's capability to receive
    USD deposits.

:::: note
::: title
:::

**Currency Conversion Fees Not Reimbursed**

You are responsible for ensuring your bank can process incoming USD
international transfers. Red Hat cannot reimburse any fees your bank
might charge for receiving a USD deposit. Nor can Red Hat reimburse any
fees you might incur if you convert currencies yourself when making a
payment. The reimbursement will cover the USD equivalent of your
approved expenses.
::::

All FRRs are tracked as issues in the {url-ospo-sponsorship}\[Red Hat
OSPO Sponsorship GitLab repository\].

1.  Navigate to: {url-ospo-sponsorship}

2.  Create a **New issue**.

3.  Select the **\"Reimbursement Request\"** template from the \"Choose
    a template\" dropdown.

4.  **Crucially, ensure the \"This issue is confidential...​\" checkbox
    at the bottom of the form is checked.** This protects your personal
    and financial information.

5.  Complete all fields in the template accurately:

    - **Full legal name**: As per your bank records.

    - **FAS username**: Your Fedora Account System ID.

    - **Event name**:

    - **Event date(s)**: Formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` to `YYYY-MM-DD`.

    - **URL to public approval ticket**: The link to your Fedora
      Mindshare (or other body) funding approval.

    - **URL to your event report and/or social media**: Link to your
      published report.

    - **URL to your BEAR Compliance Request ticket (if applicable)**:
      Link to your issue in `{url-ospo-bear}` if you had one.

    - **Total amount budgeted**: The total amount in USD approved by the
      Fedora community body.

    - **Total amount spent**: The total amount in USD you are requesting
      for reimbursement.

    - **Do you have receipts for all expenses?**: yes/no/TBD - should be
      \"yes\" by this stage.

    - **Full Remit Address**: Your bank's full legal address.

    - **Do you have a bank proof?**: yes/no/TBD - should be \"yes\" by
      this stage. (Refer to [Step 3.1](#banking-info) for details on
      acceptable bank proof documents.)

6.  Submit the issue. It will automatically be assigned labels like
    `check1::needs triage`, `check2::needs triage`, and
    `check3::needs triage`. The Fedora Community Architect will manage
    these.

After you open the FRR, the Fedora Community Architect (FCA) will be
notified and will guide you on the next steps for submitting your
detailed documentation. The general process is as follows:

1.  **Expense Tracker Spreadsheet**: The FCA will provide you with an
    expense tracker spreadsheet template. You must meticulously complete
    this spreadsheet, listing each expense individually with:

    - Receipt Date

    - Receipt Description

    - Vendor

    - Amount (in the original currency of the transaction)

    - Currency Code (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, MXN)

    - Amount (converted to USD)

      - **Currency Conversion to USD**: If your expenses were not in
        USD, you need to convert each one to USD for the spreadsheet.
        Use a reputable online currency converter (e.g.,
        {url-wise-converter}\[Wise.com\]) for exchange rates applicable
        on the date you are preparing the spreadsheet. Make a note of
        this conversion date in your spreadsheet (e.g., \"Conversions
        via Wise.com on YYYY-MM-DD\"). The FCA will verify these
        conversions.

2.  **Submitting Your Documents (Receipts, Bank Proof, Spreadsheet)**:

    - **Preferred Method**: Secure Google Drive Folder

      - The FCA will typically create a secure Google Drive folder
        specifically for your FRR and share the link with you via email
        and as a comment in your confidential GitLab issue.

      - Upload the following to this Google Drive folder:

        - **Each itemized, dated receipt** as a separate, clearly named
          digital file (e.g., PDF, JPG, PNG). Do *not* combine all
          receipts into one giant file.

        - Your **official bank proof document** (PDF format is
          preferred).

        - Your **completed expense tracker spreadsheet**.

    - **Alternative Method**: Email (if you do not have a Google
      Account)

      - If you do not have a Google account and cannot use Google Drive,
        please state this clearly in your GitLab reimbursement issue.

      - In this case, the FCA will instruct you to compile all your
        documents into a *single ZIP file*, including all receipts, your
        bank proof, and your completed expense tracker spreadsheet.

      - Email this ZIP file directly to the Fedora Community Architect
        at `fca [at] fedoraproject [dot] org`.

Once you have submitted all your documentation for your FRR, the Fedora
Community Architect and internal Red Hat teams will handle the
processing. This stage is mostly for your awareness of what happens
next.

- **FCA Verification**: The FCA will thoroughly review your FRR and all
  submitted documents (receipts, bank proof, spreadsheet, event report
  link, BEAR approval if applicable).

- **GitLab Label Updates**: As the FCA verifies each part of your
  submission, they will update the scoped labels on your GitLab issue
  (e.g., from `check1::needs triage` to `check1::approved in ticket`,
  then `check3::docs provided` once all documents are confirmed complete
  and correct).

- **Internal ServiceNow Request**: Once the FRR passes all three checks,
  the FCA will create a \"Payment Exception Approval\" request within
  Red Hat's internal ServiceNow system. This internal request uses the
  information you provided (your legal name, bank details, USD expense
  totals) and attaches your collated documentation. It also uses Red Hat
  internal details like GL Code (`721300`), Cost Center (`708`), and a
  reason for payment (e.g., \"*Reimbursement of BEAR-approved expenses
  for volunteering at the Fedora booth at the FOSDEM open source
  conference in February 2025.*\").

- **Manager Approval**: The FCA's manager will then approve this Payment
  Exception Request directly within ServiceNow.

This is the final stage where you receive your funds.

- **Payment**: After all internal Red Hat approvals are complete, the
  payment will be processed. It will be deposited in USD into the bank
  account you provided.

- **Timeline**: While there is no strict Service Level Agreement (SLA),
  Red Hat aims for a reimbursement turnaround of approximately **30
  days**. This 30-day period typically starts *after* all your
  documentation has been correctly submitted, verified by the FCA, and
  the internal ServiceNow request has been fully approved. Delays can
  occur if documentation is initially incomplete, incorrect, or if there
  are questions.

- **Payment Reference**: When you receive the deposit, the payment
  reference or note from Red Hat will usually be in the format:
  `Ticket redhat/ospo/sponsorship#XY. EVENT_NAME, MONTH YEAR.` (e.g.,
  \"*Ticket redhat/ospo/sponsorship#123. FOSDEM, February 2025*\"). This
  helps you identify the source and purpose of the funds.

- **Confirming Receipt of Funds**: It is your responsibility to confirm
  when the reimbursement has been deposited into your account. Once you
  have received the funds, you must add a comment to your confidential
  GitLab reimbursement issue. This notification confirms to the Fedora
  Community Architect that the payment has been successfully received.
  It also finalizes the reimbursement process for your request. Timely
  confirmation is crucial for accurate tracking.
