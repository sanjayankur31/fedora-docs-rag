This document provides an overview of what Fedora Server Edition is, the goals and objectives, and what it is designed for. It is written from a user’s point of view to allow people to understand what the Server Edition should do, what it is useful for, and what to expect from it in the future.

== Fedora Server Vision

Fedora Server is a real-world incarnation of the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/[Fedora Project's vision] for organizations, individual users, and developers to develop, deploy, and maintain applications and services – freely, autonomously, and under their own control.

== Fedora Server Mission

*As a user, you gain the opportunity to use the server of the future right now.*

Fedora Server provides a stable, flexible, and universally-adaptable base for the everyday provisioning of services and applications by organizations and individuals, based on the latest technology and is available quickly after the upstream releases.

*As a developer or system integrator, you gain an eye on the server of the future.*

Fedora Server is also a platform for developers and system integrators, which provides an implementation of the latest server technology for exploring and evaluating.

== Market Opportunity

The server operating system market is mature and yet, constantly evolving. The technologies that are in the midst of changing computing, such as e.g. cloud or containers, depend, at the end of the day, on servers running on bare metal and capable of handling the requirements of those technologies‘.

Fedora Server, being a leading-edge Linux distribution, is the ideal place for developers, system administrators and DevOps specialists to keep up-to-date with these low-level technologies. Fedora Server provides the opportunity to explore these features and provide a stable place to deploy applications, both new and legacy.

Fedora Server provides a stable foundation, with balanced resource utilization, yet delivering the latest technologies giving administrators every day exposure to the latest tooling as soon as it is usable.

== Why use Fedora Server?

Fedora Server has so many genuine advantages that it is hard to list them all. The nine most important ones are:

* The twice-yearly, release cycle allows for the inclusion of the latest versions of system and application software almost immediately. Users and system administrators are empowered to swiftly respond to new market options and changing or expanding customer requirements.
* A sophisticated release and quality assurance process enables a high level of reliability and stability, despite the fast release cycle. This achieves an excellent balance between ‘bleeding edge’ and maturity for use in mainstream deployments.
* Fedora Server includes enterprise-grade security, resulting in carefully pre-configured releases, offering uncompromising security without extensive configuration work by system administrators.
* A great variety of available software, all included in that release process, opens up a wide range of possibilities for flexibility in building a server according to the specific needs and wishes of a customer or end-user.
* The latest, stable, modern system administration tools (e.g. cockpit) noticeably reduces the burden of system administration.
* Strict alignment with other Fedora editions as well as the twice-yearly releases are associated with less disruptive upgrades – several small updates are easier to manage than a few big ones.
* The upgrade process itself is very simple and straightforward, without requiring re-installation. Skipping one release is also viable, in case new capabilities are not immediately needed. All in all, Fedora is decidedly system administrator friendly.
* Fedora Server ensures utmost freedom from restrictions imposed by commercial interests or corporate feature management and excellent backwards hardware compatibility.
* Developers find an excellent development environment for the next generation server as well as application software with the latest software versions available.

== Server Edition Objectives

Fedora Server Edition offers a highly flexible and adoptable multi-purpose server platform, usable at every scale.

* A platform for important infrastructure tasks and basic services (DNS, DHCP, FreeIPA, and others)
* A platform for various important, dedicated server applications (file/storage server, database server, user-developed web applications, etc.)
* A platform for deploying Infrastructure-as-a-Service systems for best deployment of Fedora Cloud images.
* A platform for deploying containerized applications supporting multiple container technologies, among which the system administrator can choose according to custom requirements.
* A platform for virtual machines, as host as well as guest system, supporting different technologies, among which the system administrator can choose according to custom requirements.
* Infrastructure to allow efficiently managing many servers as a single unit. The product only commits to producing basic tools, but the infrastructure will allow more advanced tools to be created.
* An operating platform capable to run any combination of forementioned services all according to very different needs of users rsp system administrators (multipurpose feature).

Fedora Server can be used as a standalone server that runs an application or service as well as a member of a cluster in a data center. As a result of strict adherence to open standards, it natively cooperates with different server technologies and implementations.

=== Additional Overall Objectives

Aside from the adoption and development of the Fedora Server platform, we have additional goals that are fundamental in any case:

* Security-minded: secure by design - extending into TPM support, disk encryption enablement
* Community-driven: Intense feedback about product direction and potential improvements. This is separate from “bug reports” in that we hope to engage the audience and receive detailed feedback about use cases, desired features, developing trends in cloud management, etc. We encourage more patches and contributions that will help improve the Server Edition, and Fedora in general.

== Primary Use Cases, User Profiles, and most important Features

=== Use Cases

The Fedora Server will need to address the following use-cases:

* On premise server for small and medium-sized enterprises hosting mail service, calendar, and branch specific (probably containerized) software – either single node deployment or multi-node deployment with automatic failover
* Dedicated SOHO server, ‘bare metal’ rented from a remote provider and under its own full control, offering various services. Public access through VMs for security reasons.
* Single node or multi-node deployment in an enterprise data center providing up-to-date software versions according to domain specific requirements in a stable and secure OS, capable to provide different runtime environments – native, VM, different container systems – driven by domain specific demands.
* Personal home server, located ‘on premise’ in own flat / house and used as NAS, backup device, and for applications such as mail repository, contact database, calendar, ebook library, media server, etc.
* Development box, providing developers with the latest software version and excellent developing tools

=== User Profiles

We will use a set of personas to describe our target users and their respective needs. We list the typical personas by brief title and a short list of key characteristics.

==== System Administrator "Macgyver"

* Administrator with limited hardware and personnel resources to work with
* Requires simple automation to cope with repetitive tasks
* Needs to be able to do “a lot with a little”

==== DevOps Engineer/Administrator

* Focus is on time-to-deploy and time-to-recover as opposed to uptime
* Value is achieved by delivering the latest capabilities fastest
* Needs to be able to deliver quickly to PaaS, SaaS and bare-metal servers

==== Application Developer

* Needs a platform with API and ABI stability guarantees
* Focus will be on minimizing risk when making changes
* Needs latest technology in virtualization and containerization
* Likes a platform similar to the workstation

==== Decision Maker

* Makes purchasing decisions and directs technology choices
* Interacts with upstream FOSS communities to identify potential value

==== The Home Admin

* I need a somewhat stable machine, with a graphical interface (Cockpit) and just want to start a couple of containers and/or virtual machines to have nextcloud running on it.
* I need some gitea here, some gitlab there, some jenkins, some photoprism, minecraft, etc. Can I build a NAS easily?
* I am ok with updates and reboots over night, but it should work. It would be awesome to have mDNS and a Web UI.

==== The Hyperscaler

* I treat my servers as “cattle, not pets”. Overall uptime is more important than individual server uptime
* I want to have a reliable platform for virtualization, core services and container. It should be out of my way, so I can focus on scaling, monitoring, implementation
* I want to automate server installation, and configurations for hostname, timeserver, hardening, etc. In addition I want to deploy typical services like mariadb, httpd, nginx, redis, nodejs, java, etc. in a reproducible way. To see what the machines are doing, I need a well documented way to manage, monitor and backup them.
* My Security Team also wants me to disable unneeded services, disable legacy protocols, enable hardening on several levels.

==== The Remixer / "Let’s build upon it"

* I love how Fedora works and I want to create something upon it.
* I need a very well documented build process and maybe tools to produce new install images
* Removing the branding should be possible with some compiler flags or variables, so I don’t need to mess with the code itself.
* I have a raspberry/intel nuc/etc. and playing a bit with new stuff.

=== Most Important Features

* The user can easily deploy and configure any supported Fedora Server application as well as rapidly re-deploy services in accordance with their DevOps practices. (Examples range from BIND DNS, DHCP, Database server, iSCSI target, File/Storage server, up to OpenStack Hypervisor Node, and the like)
* The user can query, monitor, configure and manage a Fedora Server and the resources consumed by services remotely using stable and consistent public interfaces.
* The user can deploy and configure Fedora Server to provide domain infrastructure with FreeIPA and Samba Active Directory solutions. Fedora Server can become Domain Controller in a newly established domain or join existing domain as a Domain Controller or a Domain Member.
* Users can create, manipulate and terminate large numbers of virtual machines and containers using a stable and consistent interface.
* The user is enabled to install and manage Fedora Server in a headless mode, either directly on the command line or supported by Cockpit, a lightweight Web GUI.

== Logistical Concerns

=== Delivery Mechanisms

Fedora Server Edition generates installation resources for different scenarios

* an offline install ISO image for a full local installation
* a net install ISO image for booting into an online installation
* a virtual disk image to be imported into a Fedora Server Edition KVM virtual environment
* a disk image for installation on supported aarch64 single board computers (SBC)

Supported installation methods are:

* Manual install without a supporting infrastructure (e.g. the very first Linux server).
* Automated (“mass”) install within a larger Linux infrastructure (e.g. PXE is an option, may have LDAP/IPA).

Existing servers should be upgradable to new releases with minimal involvement by the admin.

Users will be able to obtain these images from the Fedora Project website and mirror networks.

=== Documentation

Fedora Server Edition documentation will be made available in a dedicated section of the Fedora documentation project. For selected topics, we strive for integration into the generic Fedora documentation.

= Fedora Server Technical Specification

[NOTE]
====
.*This is an approved document*
Updated version as finalized at the *Server Working Group IRC Meeting* on https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/2022-08-17/fedora-server.2022-08-17-17.00.html[August 17, 2022]

[abstract]
This document aims to describe the technical characteristics and properties of the Fedora Server Edition in detail. This includes provided services, installed software, and the like. It also defines characteristics and features that are not yet or not fully implemented in the current Fedora Server Edition release.


== Preamble

Fedora Server provides a stable, flexible, and universally-adaptable base for the everyday provisioning of services and applications by organizations and individuals, based on the latest technology and available quickly after the upstream releases. It aims to empower users to deploy the services they need, whether using proven mature techniques or current technical developments, under their own control and adapted to their own needs. For this purpose, it provides a broad spectrum of available techniques from which users can choose completely independently and without predetermined valuations.

== Overview

The specification defines implementation details, implementation variants, and especially extensions. They constitute a detailing and technical elaboration of the goals and principles as stated in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/server-working-group/docs/product-requirements-document/[Fedora Server Product Requirements Document].

Specifically, it covers the following topics

* *Core Features*
+
describes the basic features and properities. They constitute the base system, which is installed by the (graphical) installer by default.
* *System Administration*
+
describes properties and capabilities of the default administration interface
* *Advanced Features*
+
describes additional features that are not part of the default (graphical) installation but require subsequent administrative action
* *Server Roles*
+
describe various services which Fedora Server can validly and concurrently offer to users. Additionally, these are specifically supported by Ansible provided administratve assistance.

The features and properties specified here are the basis for the specification of Fedora Server release criteria and release blockers.

== 1. Core Features
This section describes the basic properties and features of the platform and their intended use.

=== 1.1 Supported Architectures and Install Media

Fedora Server will definitely run on and provide install media for x86_64 and aarch64 servers. The project may provide install media for additional architectures. But these are not part of standard quality management and may be available ephemerally.

* A *network installation media* providing a minimal package set allowing to boot the system, connect to Internet and contact the Fedora media server to download packages to be installed.
* A *local installation media* providing the default package set as well as any featured services that are meaningfully installed without a network connection.
** It can additionally point at network resources to make available an ever larger package set.
** Nevertheless, this media should be friendly to regions with limited Internet connection stability and performance. Thus, it is a trade-off between completeness and practical download size..
* A *virtual machine disk image* for simplified installation of Fedora Server Edition in a KVM virtual environment. The image reproduces the Server Edition completely and without restrictions, as far as features are usable in a virtual environment.
* A raw *aarch64 disk image* for installation on a Singe Board Computer (SBC).

=== 1.2 File System and Storage Organization

Fedora Server gives the highest priority to maximum reliability and security of data  with a maximum of possible performance.

To achieve this goal, Fedora Server encourages strict _separation of system and user data_ and encourages to further isolate user data, e.g. by services. Any system maintenance must be possible with the least risk of endangering or compromising user data (e.g. by temporarly unmounting) and an error somewhere on the local disk storage should remain as isolated as possible and without system-wide impact.

Thus, Fedora Server Edition's _default installation_

* creates the necessary standard partitions to boot the server (BiosBoot, EFI, /boot)
* creates a Volume Group with one Logical Volume of a reasonable minimal size to accomodate the root file system and system files using _XFS_
* leaves the remaining space untouched for customization by the system administrator for user data, services or other uses. The installer must also support the following common options
** enlarge the one logical volume to accomodate custom data as well without any separation (_not recommended_)
** create one or more logical volumes to accomodate custom data
** or even create an additional Volume Group dedicated to custom data

The installer also provides a custom partitioning interface to accommodate use cases beyond the scope of default partitioning.

Additionally, the installer shall provide an option to enable disk encryption.

=== 1.3 Basic service and daemon management

Systemd provides ways to control and monitor the activity and status of system services, resources they require, and the like. All system services must provide systemd units to be included in the Fedora Server standard installation.

=== 1.4 SELinux

SELinux will be enabled in enforcing mode, using the targeted policy. It must fully protect any installable system component and functional application.

Fedora Server Edition must include a user-friendly mechanism for identifying SELinux denials and find workarounds. Currently, Cockpit's SELinux module provides this functionality.

Additionally, any Server Role we provide MUST also provide options to appropriately modify the system's SELinux configuration (adjusting booleans, for example).

=== 1.5 Networking

By default, NetworkManager controls and manages all network devices and connections. Any modifications or adjustments to the network configuration must use the NetworkManager configuration tools or the public NetworkManager D-BUS API.

Installation or First Boot must create a permanent configuration file for each physical network device found, or at least a stub configuratin file. Primarily, DHCP is to be used and enabled if available. Both must allow the system administrator to customize the default configuration without restriction.

=== 1.6 Firewall

The default method in Fedora Server is _firewalld_. It is part of the basic initial installation and not deselectable.

The default initial configuration must provide the highest security possible with the ability of remote administration. But it may not interfere with the normal operation of programs installed by default.

Therefore, on a pristine default system, the only open incoming ports are SSH and Cockpit.

Configuration of ssh allows root access only with key-based login, if at all.

Additionally, any Server Role we provide MUST also provide options to appropriately display and modify firewalld's configuration options.

=== 1.7 Account handling

SSSD will provide the backing storage for identity management. The Fedora Server is expected to nearly always be configured for ‘centrally-managed’ user information; it must be possible to configure it to rely on a directory service for this information. Fedora Server will provide and support the realmd project for joining FreeIPA and Active Directory domains automatically. Interacting with other identity sources will remain a manual configuration effort.

=== 1.8 Logging

Fedora Server uses systemd-journald and rsyslog for system logging. It's recommended all applications submit logs to systemd-journald.

It stores log files locally by default and also supports sending full log data to an external server to the maximum extent possible. It uses rsyslog for forwarding data to a central server.

=== 1.9 Miscellaneous System Information

System locale, timezone, hostname, etc. will be managed through the services provided by systemd for this purpose, specifically

* localed: localectl
* timedated: timedatectl
* hostnamed: hostnamectl

=== 1.10 System Installer

The desired installation experience for the Fedora Server product is to limit the pre-installation user interaction to the minimum. The storage configuration UI does provide a single sensible default and an alternative, fully customizable configuration UI.

Package selection will be supplementary.

Fedora Server expects to be the sole citizen on the system. Support for coexisting with other operating systems is not a goal.

Fedora Server supports kickstart as implemented by pyKickstart and Anaconda as the unattended installation mechanism.



== 2. System Administration

=== 2.1 Appearance

The primary system management tool is CLI using bash on a system console. Locally, the default Fedora Server boots to a text terminal login screen. It expects the system administrator to type the required commands or using bash scripts or to use Ansible roles and plays.

The local login prompt must also display any appropriate information needed to establish remote administration of the system, in particular, Cockpit's access URL (see next paragraph).

For remote installation, ssh and sftp are installed and activated by default. Additionally, Cockpit is installed and activated by default and provides a Web based graphical Interface to assist remote system administration.

The Fedora Server does _not provide a local graphical environment_. If the administrator elects to install a desktop, they should choose and install a display manager themselves.

=== 2.2 Input Methods

The input method support for the Fedora Server console access is the LOCALE support in the command shell.

=== 2.3 Accessibility

Accessibility support on the Fedora Server will be limited to devices supporting the vision-impaired on the console.

=== 2.4 Software updates

Software updates on the Fedora Server must be possible to perform either locally using command-line tools (dnf), remote using _ssh_ or _Cockpit_, or centrally by common management systems (e.g. _Satellite_, _Ansible_).

=== 2.5 Problem reporting

Problems and error conditions (e.g. kernel oopses, Selinux AVCs, application crashes, OOM, disk errors) should all be reported in the systemd journal.
Support for sending this information to a central place (like abrt does for crashes today) is mandatory.




== 3. Advanced Features

=== 3.1 Virtualization

==== 3.1.1 KVM / Libvirt

libvirt-daemon will be used to manage virtualization capabilities.

==== 3.1.2 XEN based Virtualization

XEN based Virtualisation is available in Fedora and installable with Fedora Server. While it may work, Xen virtualization is not officially supported on Fedora Server.

=== 3.2 Containerization

Fedora Server Editions does support various different container technologies.

==== 3.2.1 Podman Application Container
Podman must be installable and usable right out of the box.

==== 3.2.2 Systemd-nspawn System- and Application Container
A systemd-nspawn container must be installable and usable right out of the box.


==== 3.2.3 Libvirt LXC System Container
A Libvirt LXC container must be installable and usable right out of the box.

== 4. Server Roles

Server Roles are a high level set of software services with additional administrative support to smoothness integrate into Fedora Server Edition and validated to operate concurrently and conflict-free in Fedora Server. An example is Mail Service, that includes various system services as postfix, dovecot and alike.

Server Roles are supposed to get developed in the Fedora 37 – 40 time frame.

=== 4.1 Server Roles Requirements

Supported Server Services are supposed facilitate the following functions

* A mechanism to install the packages necessary to deploy the service.
* A mechanism to deploy a service whose packages are already installed on the system by providing the necessary information and procedures to provision it.
* A mechanism to install optional components of a service after deployment.
* A configuration interface to modify high-level configuration options.
* A helper tool (preferrable based on LVM snapshot) to perform a backup or alternativ a list of files on the filesystem that should be included in a backup set.

Depending on practical experience, Server Roles may additionally need a query interface providing metadata information about the service (not all services must implement all parts of this):

* A list of system services provided by the Supported Server Service, as well as data about whether those services are currently running (or enabled, in the case of socket-activated services)
* A list of the ports that the role operates on, as well as data about whether those ports are currently firewalled.
* A mechanism to open and close ports that the server service operates on for some or all interfaces.
* If the Server Service is designed to operate on the network, it should automatically open those ports (see Firewall) during deployment.
* An interface to set processor affinity, memory limits, etc. where sensible.

=== 4.2 Server Role Administration

Ansible is the projected administration tool.

=== 4.3 Projected Server Roles

==== 4.3.1 Domain Controller

The Fedora Server Domain Controller Service will be provided by the FreeIPA project.
This Server Service is a blocker for the release of Fedora Server.

==== 4.3.2 Database Management System (DBMS)

The Fedora Server Database Management Systemn is provided by the PostgreSQL project.
This Server Service is a blocker for the release of Fedora Server.

==== 4.3.3 Local Network File Server service

The Fedora Server Fileservice will be provided by the Samba project.

==== 4.3.4 WEB Server service

The Fedora Server Web Server will be provided by the Apache project.

==== 4.3.5 Web Application Server service

The Fedora Server Web Application Server service will be provided by the Wildfly project.

==== 4.3.6 Mail Service

The Fedora Server Mail Service will be provided by the Postfix project and supporting projects like Dovecot, Spamassassin, Dkim, etc.

== 5. Appendix

=== 5.1 Core Package list

This list includes all packages the core media are shipping with the current release. It is the _mandatory minimal list of packages_ that needs to be installed on a system at all times for it to qualify as a _Fedora Server_ install. This package lists the priority focus for QA and bug fixing.
To produce the list, issue the following command:

_TBD_

= Federa Server WG Governance Charter
Stephen Daley; Peter Boy
:page-authors: {author}, {author_2}



[abstract]
.*This is an approved document*,
It was originally approved by the Server Working Group on November 5, 2013, and by FESCo on November 6, 2013, The latest version was approved September 12, 2017.


This document describes the governing structure for the Fedora Server WG.

== Membership

The Fedora Server Working Group has a variable number of members. This group is primarily an organizational team; they exist solely to establish quorum during voting meetings.

Any WG member may voluntarily exit their chair at any time. New members may be added to the Working Group by being nominated by an existing member, then getting a +1 vote and zero -1 votes from three existing members within a two-week period. After that window is up, the person is added to the group.

The current composition of the Server Working Group can usually be found at the Server landing page.

== Making Decisions

Because Fedora is a global project, members of the working group may be distributed across multiple timezones. It may be possible to have real-time IRC meetings or Google+ hangouts, but in general we will conduct business on the mailing list or announce either IRC meetings or Google+ hangout events in advance should they take place.

The Server Working Group strives to work on consensus and only vote on things where it’s clear people aren’t going to be convinced to agree. Many of our decisions can be made through "lazy consensus." Under this model, an intended action is announced on the mailing list, discussed, and if there is no controversy or dissenting views with a few days, simply done.

For bigger issues, they must be discussed and voted on in a public IRC meeting. Public IRC meetings are generally held most weeks on Tuesdays at 4:00pm Eastern US time in link:https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#fedora-meeting[#fedora-meeting] on Libera. For an IRC meeting to be held, at least three Working Group members must be present. Votes are accepted by all participants in the meeting (not just those of Working Group members), so the community is highly encouraged to join. In the case where an interested party can not make it to a meeting, they can pre-vote via the mailing list.

Because of lacking out quorum we had a open discussion about various topics

* __**Essentials at a glance**__
+
(This summary is AI generated and edited)

** *Flock Conference Submission*

*** We  discussed submitting a proposal for the upcoming Flock conference, suggesting a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session, a talk, or both.
*** BoF sessions at Flock are planned for "Day 0" and will not be officially recorded or streamed, which is acceptable to the group.

** *Working Plan Progress*

*** Progress on creating topics for the working plan in the repository has been slow due to time constraints.
*** pboy is evaluating the "backup / rescue" topic and notes it seems to be a long-term project.

** *Next Release Testing*

*** Testing for the next release (Fedora 44) is urgent as the branch date is the following week (2026-02-03).
*** The KVM and aarch64 Server images are flawed, specifically with the wrong file type on the root partition.

We had some discussion about organising all tickets in on ticket repo instead spreading them over the various repos.

__AGREED__: We keep all tickets (and projects), even very specific detailed tickets for areas of the other repo, together in one repo.

Eseyman got a reply from the Tomcat group regarding the SELinux issue with ajp proxy. Blocking localhost access is intentional. The policy is no default network access. And localhost is seen as network access. We will pick up this later.

We want to clearly distinct between the Server Edition core use case and special uses such as ARM SBCs. In particular, a Raspberry Pi 4, the current focus in Fedora, is unsuitable for Server. We will reorganize the documentation to clearly separate the SBC articles from the main topics.

The final release actually no longer contains the possibility of a remote interactive installation initialized without terminal by kickstart file. This is the result of a system-wide switch from VNC to RDP initiated by the Workstation WG. The discontinuation is a side effect of the changes in Anaconda and was unannounced. We did not expect this omission and unfortunately discovered it too late.
+
AGREED: We will create a list of minimal manual tests and try to establish a test week for F43.
+
A particularly intensive checking require all changes that are in any way related to the Workstation WG.

** *Testing Release 41*
+
The discussion focused on optimizing our approach to release testing.  There was agreement on the one hand that the test program should be integrated into the distribution QA, and on the other hand that tests of individual functionalities should be automated. Irrespective of this, there is a need for manual testing, particularly of the (hardware) installation media.
+
Action: pboy will create a summary on the mailing list, which will be the basis for further discussion.

** *Server user poll*
+
We finally agreed on 4 goals:
+
- Who is the audience for Fedora Server
- Where is Fedora Server primarily used: Hardware or VM
- What are the main use cases for Fedora Server
- Where are future efforts of the Fedora Server WG best applied
+
A final version is to be decided at the next meeting.

Eseyman gave an https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/server@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/ZFEQZHECF4DNJA3VH4UIGGITRLFCXKFH/[overview of his impressions and experiences].
+
One wish that was expressed was to use Fedora as a router, similar to OpenWRT. It was agreed that this is not possible within the framework of Fedora Server, as the requirements for system and data security are too different.
+
One positive feedback was that Fedora was the slowest moving as well as the most backward compatible, and nevertheless with always up-to-date versions of the server software bits, of the Fedora project. A most welcome characteristic of our goals for Fedora Server Edition.

We considered a number of different topics that were discussed. By and large, our current course in the further development of Fedora Server Edition has proven itself.  The most important change will be the implementation of Ansible for our special supported services (previous server roles).
+
Everyone agrees that getting to know each other and discussing goals and next steps in person was a hugely positive experience and a tremendous motivational boost.Nothing else can replace that. Flock was very, very worthwhile and all the effort was very rewarding. Flock next year is already a positive expectation.

*** We will first discuss a possible change to the time of our meetings on the mailing list and decide at the next meeting.


** *LVM2 configuration*
+
!link https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2247872
+
The /etc/lvm/devices directory in Fedora-Server-KVM-40_Beta-1.9.x86_64.qcow2 is empty now. So far no check whether First Boot generates a suitable entry.
+
*INFO update*: Beta 1.10 contains a devices file in both server images (KVM and aarch64 SBC). So the issue is not resolved yet.
+
Action: cooltshirtguy will monitor and check the aarch64 SBC image, specifically Raspberry Pi.

* __**Essentials at a glance**__

** *Follow-up actions & announcements*
+
We are discussing how to equalize the times of the meetings of the Server WG and the Epel Team to enable everyone to participate in both. To be continued on the mailing list.

** *Review installation media*
+
An initial analysis has revealed a number of warning messages about comps files not being found. Details in:
+
Link: https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/blob/main/f/variants-fedora.xml#_46
+
Link: https://pagure.io/fedora-server/issue/130
+
_Agreed_: Sever WG will check the current compose groups in issues on fedora-server repo.


** *LVM2 configuration & ARM SBC installation*
+
The arm-image-installer script is fixed.
+
The LVM configuration issue is still open.
+
Link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2247872#c19
+
This issue is not accepted as release blocker. So it can happen that we release a kind of crap image for the 2nd time in a row.
+
But LVM group seems to be working hard on it.


** *F40 Change Set items requiring our attention*
+
Eseyman generated a list of items requiring our attention
+
Link: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/server@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CNH57V7LT4GMQN676XFDJWQ6U46BGDMK/

Our first meeting on Matrix.

* __**Essentials at a glance**__

** *Review installation media*
+
We are trying here for more then 2 years for now without a lot or results.
At Fosdem I met Tomáš, who is very experienced in release engineering (to put it a bit understated) and who has offered to help us with this. This is a great opportunity for Fedora Server Edition.
+
After an initial discussion about necessary and desired changes, we agreed that Tomáš would further analyze the current configuration files and compile them in a blog or on the server list.

** *Revisiting Server installation media naming convention*
+
The various server installation media are (still) named very differently. But it is now too late for a change to Release 40.
+
_Agreed_: We further discuss naming convention on mailing list and aim to make a final decision in 4 weeks latest. And then it is up to releng to find a workable timeframe. There is no urgency.


** *LVM2 default configuration change*
+
The issue is currently not resolved.
+
A proper resolution will involve an anaconda fix as well as a fix in arm-image-installer. We will continue to work on it.
+
Link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258764

** *Open Floor*
+
Cloud Sig will stop to maintain ImageFactory. For F41 we have to select another tool for building the non-iso images. Probable choices are Lorax, KIWI, or OSBuild, depending on what is supported in pungi and what artifacts are supported by the different tools.
+
Neil would support a move to Kiwi if we decide to do so. We want to make a final decision once releng has decided on available and supported options.

Continuing the Jan 31 meeting

* __**Essentials at a glance**__

** *LVM2 default configuration change*
+
We finally got information about the reasons for the changes in LVM default configuration and proper ways to resolve the ARM SBC installation issue.
+
In short we should retain the current default LVM configuration which includes a system.devices file and adjust the arm-image-installer script und our documentation.

** *Test planning for F40*
+
We have set up a https://hackmd.io/NtO4O9vRT3a71UMZMkceoA?both[list of manually "smoke tests"]. We now need working group members or other interested parties to take over some of the tests and enter their FAS names in the corresponding column.

** *Open Floor*
+
We will switch our meetings from IRC to Matrix starting February 21, provided we can make the necessary organizational arrangements in time.

** *LVM2 default configuration change*
+
Currently the default LVM configuration results in vgscan and vgchange not inspecting new devices that are not listed in /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices. A follow-up to this is also the error when creating aarch64 SBC filesystem images.

* __**Essentials at a glance**__

** *Fedora release 39 - State of Server media and Download Web page*
+
The Situation regarding aarch64 on SBC is a bit better then 2 weeks ago, but still but still not satisfactory. A SBC is now installable if you don't use an installation host with actrive LVM drives, but use e.g. Fedora Workstation. In this respect, it would be disproportionate to continue to regard this as a release blocker. The problem must now be solved for Release 40.
+
It's really unfortunate, that we discovered the bug so late in the Beta process. We need to review our testing procedures. We have relied too much on the automated tests.
+
For the next release we should improve the download page. We need to find a better name as the outdated term "DVD" and should clearly distinguish the SBC variant from the other installations, it is best to introduce a separate section.
+
ACTION: Mowest will take care ot disussed modifications of the Server download page.

** *Fedora release 39 rc current state and how to continue*
+
The x86_64 versions work great. There is still a severe bug with installing the aarch64 SBC version on Fedora Server.
+
_AGREED_: If the LVM issue can not be resolved for f39 release, Server WG would like to opt out providing a f39 installation medium for aarch SBC, continue to distribute f38 and encourage to update using dnf.

** *Package fail2ban orphaned*
+
In the meantime the orphaned package was picked by a new maintainer.

AS it looks at the moment the committee has accepted and is planning with a presentation: Fedora Server Edition – Quo Vadis? Unfortunately a workshop about Server in virtual environment, that I proposed, too, didn't make it.

** *Could we drop Active Directory requirements from Fedora release criteria?*
+
*Agreed* WG agrees about to use automated testing using Samba AD as the server end (instead of a native Windows server) and to keep the status of release criteria.
+
Full compatibility with Windows Server remains the goal regardless of the testing procedure. And an _inability to connect to a real Microsoft AD server remains a release blocking criterion_, since that is (and remains) the most prominent domain controller in the world.

Mowest informs about the availability of a https://fedora.gitlab.io/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0/server/[first complete draft], although still with some placeholders. The discussion about https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/wwwfpo-2022/-/issues/23#note_1276926623[further development] is still ongoing. The current topic is the design of the header. We agree that it should express as well as possible the universality and wide scope of Fedora Server Edition (from SBC to SME to Data Center).

** *Shorter Shutdown Timer*

We will first review the Core Services of our current xref:docs/server-technical-specification.adoc["_Technical Specification_"] to see what configuration is implemented for a shutdown. Furthermore, we will consider conducting a test tag on this point, although implementation is likely to be difficult. Depending on the findings, we will decide on the further handling of the magnitude of the default timeout.
+
We found contradictions resp. ambiguities about the exact configuration of the current timeout configuration in Server. Nirik will clarify this.

Mowest made contact with the revamp team and introduced himself as Server contact. We are now in the flow to work on it.
+
The next step is to collect content for our pages. Mowest asks to contribute key ideas, messages, mission statements for the content of the page. We prefer professional, meaningful texts, not rather content-less marketing phrases, which can be found partly on some newly designed pages.

__INFO__: No outstanding action items

2. *Release 37 Beta testing*
+
It is verified the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088113[software raid bug] is a release blocker. Not solved yet, but it is being worked on.

3. *Server VM status and the way forward*
+
Thanks to _nirik_ we have a Server VM x86_64 and s390 image in F37 and in Rawhide. It was a kind of last minute rescue after a rather https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/pull-request/905[bumpy ride]. And thanks to _sgallagh_ for support in the not so easy way to get the kick-start file done at all.
+
The kick-start failed on ppc64le and aarch64, unfortunately. The cause is likely to be different partitioning requirements, but the PR for a customized kick-start file was  https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/pull-request/915[hanging again].
+
We will need to review the current experience for its impact on our plan to update the server distribution media. Under the current  circumstances, implementation seems quite unrealistic or at least extremely costly and time-consuming.

2. *Final decision about an updated Fedora Server Technical Specification*
+
It was consensus, that the document is not immutable and thus change be changed later if ideas for improvements surface later. Therefore, a decision now and start with the next tasks.
+
__AGREED__: WG agrees about the techn.spec. in the current version, with alt. 1 for section 1.2 and editorial adaptations as discussed today.

3. *Using Ansible to install and configure Wildfly*
+
This is a key component of our "Supported by Ansible“-project (Server Roles), which has taken a back seat to everyday issues for far too long.
+
jwhimpel has developed a playbook where currently there is still a problem with Letsencrypt certificates to be fixed.
+
__ACTION__: jwhimpel  will provide access to the playbook on GitHub so we can re-play the installation and test it.

* _Summary info_

1. *Follow up actions*
+
__DONE__: Post on devel list thread F37 proposed change to GPT as default partitioning schema about the regression regarding software raid installations.
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIU6IKPCPD2BXDUFDZUZ2G2ZQNT5JW57/
+
__DONE__: Created an issue containing 2 test cases for biosboot GPT software raid installations

+
__DONE__: created a stub of NFS server installation and Cockpit for administration
+
__ONGOING__: Created Change proposal to add Server VM is still processing
+
__ONGOING__: Discussion about changes around the default hostname configuration
+
__ONGOING__: Review of the dnsmasq documentation by eseyman

2. *Change proposal about GPT as default partitioning for bios boot*
+
__LINK__: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/GPTforBIOSbyDefault
+
Discussion: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/server@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/VSM473WRHKIIIJYZZCVXAO7XFS4ACHPH/
+
FESCo has accepted the Change Proposal without discussion. We now have the problem of preserving our users from  harm unfortunately done intentionally or, at best, negligently by some of our own members who are owners of the Change Proposal. Unfortunately, the perpetrators do now not care how harm can be averted from our users with Release 37 and do not even bother to attend the meeting on this topic to find a suitable resolution if the issue.
+
Stephen Gallagher started a process to qualify the Anaconda software raid bug as a blocker to the GPT Change Proposal. If accepted by QA as a blocker, it will have to be fixed (or the Change reverted) in order to ship Fedora. This would be a perfect and constructive solution.
+
__Agreed__: Server WG agrees with sgallagh's suggestion to block the GPT change until the Anaconda issue is resolved  and considers it as most essential.

3. *Planning for Fedora 37: Additional changes to discuss? (continued)*
+
For part of the discussion we have a new tracking issue: https://pagure.io/fedora-server/issue/88[#88] , It summarizes all the individual measures that we have discussed for improvement and entail an adjustment of the installation media.
+
Agreed: Issue #88 is postponed to F38
+
There are various new bug reports regarding the size of installation media, very similar to those on F36. We'll ask Adam about it, He resolved those issues for F36.

4. *How to proceed with Cockpit File Sharing module NFS part*

= User Documentation Maintenance
The Fedora Server Edition working group; Peter Boy (pboy); Stephen Daley (mowest)
:page-authors: {author}, {author_2}, {author_3}
// :revnumber: F42-F43

[abstract]
Part of the Server Edition Working Group's tasks is to create and maintain user documentation. This is intended to enable or facilitate users to use the services offered in accordance with our technical specifications safely and correctly. Here we describe the basic structure of this work and thereby enable all users to contribute to the documentation.


== Goals

We want to and maintain a Fedora Server Edition user documentation and keep it up to date on an ongoing basis that

* focuses on the specific features and procedures of the Fedora Server Edition
* also includes brief explanations and rationales that convey the meaning and underlying concepts
* contains copy-and-paste capable instructions that allow even less experienced administrators to operate safely and reliably
* refers to the upstream documentation for general information, where available

== Organization

Fedora uses Antorra CMS to create its documentation website. To enable authors to contribute to web pages even without solid knowledge of web design, Antorra uses simpler texts written in AsciiDoc, which are automatically converted into complex HTML pages. These texts are stored in Git repositories.

The AsciiDoc source texts for the Fedora Server user documentation are located at https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation.

The public user documentation is available at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-server/

== Contributions

Authors as well as users should be able to contribute to Fedora Server documentation with as little effort as possible and without technical hurdles. We provide several ways to contribute.

1. The most common way for casual contributions is to _open a ticket_ and describe the issue, and maybe to make a proposal.
2. Contact the Working Group in our Matrix room.
2. Edit the page in question using a __Web-based page editor__.
3. Set up and work in a _local authoring environment_ on your desktop.
4. You may send us an email, e.g. while reading a document on our Web pages.


=== Open a ticket (problem report)

When reading a document, you see a "bug" button on the rightmost side below the blue top bar. Click it and you are forwarded to create an issue. Members of the Working Group are notified and will take care of it. However, you must have a Fedora account, so you can log in.

=== Write in the Fedora Server Matrix room

Open your Web Browser and visit the https://matrix.to/#/#server:fedoraproject.org[Fedora Server Matrix room]. You can either use the Web Interface or switch to the Element App. This is an asynchronous communication channel. It may take some time for someone to respond.

=== Edit a page via a Web Editor

Besides the aforementioned "bug" button there is a button that stylizes pen and note. It leads to a web-based editor that can be used to make changes to this very page. These are not applied directly, but members of the documentation team are notified for a review. For detailed information see chapter xref:usr-docs-maintenance/webui-page-editor.adoc[Working with the Web based page editor]

=== Working in a local authoring environment

For longer-term engagement, it makes sense to set up a complete authoring environment. It requires some preparations, but it provides the most powerful set of tools. The article xref:usr-docs-maintenance/local-authoring.adoc[Local Authoring] has some tips to get you started.

=== Authenticating with Forgejo

Git actions happen via HTTPS on forge.fedoraproject.org. Here is a quick way to get set up. Note: These instructions assume you already have git up and running, but you need to configure it to play nice with Forgejo.

. Install the `git-credential-libsecret` package. It will help git store your credentials in GNOME Keyring, KWallet, etc.
+
[source, bash]
-----
sudo dnf install git-credential-libsecret
-----
. Add the following information to your `~/.gitconfig` file.
+
[source, bash]
-----
[credential]
helper = libsecret
-----
. Generate an Access Token.
.. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner of Forgejo.
.. Click on `Settings` in the menu underneath your profile photo.
.. Click on `Applications` in the menu on the left side of the screen.
.. Give the token a name, set it to All (public, private, and limited), and then select your permissions.
...You will at *LEAST* need `repository read and write` access.
.. Click Generate token. You will get a warning. Copy this token because it will not be shown again.
. Push or Pull to Authenticate
.. When you git push or pull you should be asked to authenticate.
.. In KDE Plasma using KWallet, the first dialog is your username (eg. CoolFedoraDude), but it will look like a password secret box with no characters echoed. The second box that comes up will be where you paste the access token as your password.
.. The steps for GNOME Keyring should be similar.

Git should now use your local secret store to retreive your access token as needed. No more prompts every time you want to push a commit!

=== Sending an email

If you can't use any of the above options because you don't have a FAS account, you can just write your suggestions or feedback in an email to the Fedora Server list, server@lists.fedoraproject.org, or post a message on our link:https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tags/c/project/7/server-wg[discussion board]. You have to register, but it is less effort than creating a FAS account. It's best to use a form like "current version" - "proposed version". Suggestions will then be included in the text, or perhaps there will be follow-up questions.

== Quality assurance

Prior to publication, each article should be reviewed. Such articles are available in our link:https://docs.stg.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-server/[staging area] and marked as "awaiting review" or similar.

Reviewer should:

* check for technical and content accuracy. Contact the author in case of questions.
* check spelling and syntax
* refine the wording and phrases, especially in the case of non-English speaking authors

The link:https://docs.stg.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-server/[staging area] also contains articles at an early stage of development, allowing for early subject matter exchange and idea collection.

Furthermore, the published pages are mirrored, giving a complete impression of the later documentation.


== Guidelines

The article link:https://opensource.com/article/20/4/documentation?utm_campaign=intrel[What is good documentation for software projects?] provides a good summary of what we want to achieve with documentation, although it is not entirely new.

Some pointers for articles:

* Include of author(s), date of creation, last update, and the Fedora version used to test the examples.
* Start with a short summary of the subject matter, objective and desired outcome. (one paragraph of 2-3 sentences)
* Divide longer sequences into sections with subheadings and short explanations.
* Provide each step with a brief explanation/justification, if possible, a general instruction structure and a concrete example.


= Working with the Web based Page Editor
The Fedora Server Edition working group; Peter Boy (pboy); Stephen Daley (mowest)
:page-authors: {author}, {author_2}, {author_3}
// :revnumber: F37-F38

[abstract]
Fedora forge, where Fedora documentation is stored, offers the option of editing files directly in a web-based editor in the forge. This editor currently only offers basic editing functions. For example, it does not provide a preview feature. It is therefore particularly suitable for making small changes, such as correcting typos or individual sentences, quickly and easily.


[IMPORTANT]
====
This article is outdated and needs updating.
====

Members of the Fedora Server Working Group make changes directly in the main version that is published. Therefore, there is no opportunity to discuss and agree on it beforehand. For major changes, it is advisable to insert a note that the text is waiting for a final review.

However, changes are not immediately visible to the public, but only after the pages are updated hourly.

Non-members automatically save the changes in a fork and create a notification to integrate them (merge request).

== How to access an article for editing

=== The easy way

As an example, you may want to modify the local interactive installation guide. Open that page in your browser.

.Use the editor button
image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0010.png[]

At the top you see an editor button. It opens the web page editor with that article already loaded.

.The Web editor opened
image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0020.png[]

=== The direct way

Open the server user documentation on Fedora Forge in your browser.

.Fedora forge Server user docs repository
image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0030.png[]

Follow the directory tree until you find the local installation guide at modules/ROOT -> pages -> installation -> interactive-local.adoc. The file name does resemble the article title in a abbreviated form.

.Fedora forge Server user docs repository
image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0040.png[]

A click on the file name opens the web editor the same way as with the easy way.

image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0020.png[]

== How to modify an article by editing

The first thing you have to do is to log in with your Fedora account. Use the button in the top right corner. Afterwards you get some more options in the menu bar.

.The file opend by the Web editor
image::docs-maintenance/webui-editor-0050.png[]

Among other things, there is an editor button there that opens the editor.

//  =====================================================

The Fedora Server Edition working group and Pagure follow the "Pull Request Workflow". According to this, no one is supposed to change a published page immediately, but the workflow creates a copy of the page under your name (the "fork") and when you are done, the community is informed about your proposal (the pull request, or PR for short). The community can discuss the proposal and after agreement the administrator can "pull in" the proposal. The process is also known as "merge request" (MR).

The pagure Web Editor takes care of all the details "behind the scenes". You don't need to worry about it. Just proceed to edit the page.

More details to follow soon.

= Setting up a local authoring environment
The Fedora Server Edition working group; Peter Boy (pboy); Stephen Daley (mowest)
:page-authors: {author}, {author_2}, {author_3}
// :revnumber: F37-F38

[abstract]
This method involves creating a copy of the documentation source on the local workstation. Linux and macOS are directly supported. This also includes a script for generating an exact local preview. The editing itself can be done with any editor.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This article is outdated and needs updating.
====

== How it works

As already described in the xref:usr-docs-maintenance/index.adoc[introduction], the documentation is written in AsciiDoc and converted into HTML pages by the CMS. The https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation[Fedora Server user documentation git repository] contains the documentation source text.

It includes the content as well as various scripts to build and preview the site locally. The directory structure is predefined by the docs Content Management System (Antora) and must not be changed.

It has 2 permanent versions: The "main" for the published content and "stg" for planning, development, and discussion. Temporarily, additional branches may also be present.

Members of the Fedora Server Working Group have the privilege of making changes directly in the original, central repository.

Everyone else can also copy the repository, but must save changes in their own sub-section and then generate a “pull request.” This prompts members of the working group to review the proposed changes and pull them into the central repository.

In the case of major changes, members of the working group should also first submit their proposals in a separate sub-section.

== Writing tools

You can use any ASCII editor to work on the documentation files.

A particularly useful OSS Asciidoc editor is https://asciidocfx.com[AsciidocFX]. It is a Java program, very easy to install, and provides both an integrated directory access, a toolbar with the most common AsciiDoc formatting similar to a Word editor and an integrated instant preview.

== Creating a new documentation article

An xref:attachment$srv-template.adoc[annotated template] is available to make things easier. Download it and save it in the appropriate directory with a new name.

If possible, the files should be named in such a way that related files appear together in the directory listing. The most important, most differentiating parts should be at the front. For example

* filesharing-nfs-administration.adoc
* filesharing-nfs-installation.adoc
* filesharing-samba-administration.adoc
* filesharing-samba-installation.adoc

The titles should follow this pattern as far as possible and avoid redundant parts such as "How to install ..."

* File sharing with NFS - Installation
* File sharing with NFS - Administration
* File sharing using Samba - Installation
* File sharing using Samba - Administration

All file names are in lower case.


== Preparations

1. *Create a local subdirectory* where the files of the documentation should be stored, and make it your default. We use fedora-server-docs in your home directory throughout this guide
+
[…]$ mkdir ~/fedora-server-docs
[…]$ cd    ~/fedora-server-docs

2. Still in your default working directory, *clone fedora-server* repository
+
[…]$ git clone https://git@pagure.io/fedora-server.git -o upstream
+
Git will copy the complete server repo including all branches, specifically "main" and "stg" mentioned above, into a local repo on your local workstation (into _.git/_ located in your default directory).
+
Git does "tag" the cloned repo as remote repo "*upstream*".
+
At the same time it checks out the default branch "''main''" into your ''working directory'' (i.e. ~/fedora-server-docs in the above example). Therefore, when the operation terminates, you will find in your current default directory, which is now your ''working directory'', some files, e.g. README.md, docsbuilder.sh and preview.sh and a directory docs. The latter contains the content.
+
If you leave off "./" at the end, git creates another directory in your default directory with the name of the repository, i.e. fedora-server. And this directory is then the "_working directory_" to the repository. This can be useful if you want to keep track of different fedora docs projects in one directory.

3. In your browser go to https://pagure.io/fedora-server/, log in and *create a Fork*. Once you have done it, the button will read _View fork_. Switch to your fork and click on Clone and you will see 2 addresses you can use to clone (copy) the content to your local default directory
+
ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/[MY_FAS]/fedora-server.git
https://git@pagure.io/forks/[MY_FAS]/fedora-server.git
+
Still in your default working directory, add the forked Repo to your remote repos.
+
[…]$ git remote add origin ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/[MY_FAS]/fedora-server.git
+
You can use https as well. For users with a FAS account ssh is usually the better choice.

4. You have now 2 remote repos defined. Check:
+
[…]$ git remote -v
origin	ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/[MY_FAS]/fedora-server.git (fetch)
origin	ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/[MY_FAS]/fedora-server.git (push)
upstream	https://git@pagure.io/fedora-server.git (fetch)
upstream	https://git@pagure.io/fedora-server.git (push)
+
In your workflow you will update your local version to the latest versions of the server repository by "pulling" the content from "upstream" and upload your modifications and additions by "pushing" it to origin, i.e. to your fork. You will than create a "pull request", i.e. pick up your modifications and additions from your fork and integrate it into the generic repository ("origin"). This enables co-writers to review our work and comment on it.

5. In your working directory build the local version and start the preview tool.
+
[…]$ ./docsbuilder.sh

6. Back in your browser enter the *local preview address*': _localhost:8080_
+
* You should see a local preview of the current Server documentation

== Working on content

1. Check if you are on the branch you intend to work on
+
[…]$ git branch
main
* stg

2. If not, switch to the branch you want to use.
+
[…]$ git checkout [stg|main]
+
Git will adjust and modify the content of your working directory accordingly!

3. Before your begin to work update your working directory
+
[…]$ git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"

4. Modify content

5. Update preview and check:
+
[…]$ ./docsbuilder.sh
+
Preview in your browser using the address _'localhost:8080_

6. Repeat step 4 & 5 as required.


== Save Your Work

Commit your work locally and then push it into your fork "_origin_".

1. Check status
+
[…]$ git status

2. Add files to commit stage as appropriate
+
[…]$ git add <FILENAME>

3. Commit locally
+
[…]$ git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"

4. Transfer your fork of fedora server to the repository
+
[…]$ git push origin [main|stg]

5. In your browser open https://pagure.io/fedora-server, login, switch to your fork and create a pull request.
= A Git cheat sheet For Server Documentation Authors
Peter Boy (pboy)
// :page-authors: {author}, {author_2}, {author_3}
// :revnumber: F37-F38

[abstract]
The sources for the Fedora Server documentation are stored and managed in a Git repository. This is not commonly practiced by authors and therefore its usage is unknown or not well known and not routine. Authors only need a fraction of Git's functionality to manage documents. Here we compile the most common work steps and describe their Git counterparts.

[WARNING]
====
This is work in progress
====

== Prepare your local workspace
// ============================

Usually, you mirror the central _remote_ Server documentation sources on your _local_ workstation and work on the various documents locally. When done, you copy them back to the central _remote_ storage.

In Git terminology this is a _clone_ of the repository.

1. *Create a local subdirectory* where the files of the documentation should be stored, and make it to your default. We use _fedora-server-docs_ in your home throughout this guide
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ mkdir ~/fedora-server-docs
[…]$ cd    ~/fedora-server-docs
----

2. *Clone the Server documentation sources* into your default working directory
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git clone https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation.git ./
Cloning into '.'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 2500, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (510/510), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (325/325), done.
remote: Total 2500 (delta 391), reused 171 (delta 171), pack-reused 1990 (from 1)
Receiving objects: 100% (2500/2500), 19.03 MiB | 2.46 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1357/1357), done.
----
+
The "./" causes the repository to be created in the current directory. So your future working directory is "~/fedora-server-docs" If omitted, Git creates a subdirectory in the current directory with the name of the repository and copies it there. The working directory would then be "~/fedora-server-docs/user-documentation". This would be useful, if you also want to clone our wg-documentation.

3. *Check the result*
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
----
+
Git does "tag" or name the cloned repo as clone of the remote repo "*origin*". It is the default for any action you perform with the cxentral remote repository. You can check further details.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git  remote -v
origin	https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation.git (fetch)
origin	https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation.git (push)
----
+
With __fetch__, you apply all changes in the central repository to your local workspace. Do this regularly to stay up to date.
+
With __push__, you incorporate your changes into the central remote repository. Only members of the Server WG can do that.


== Prepare your remote storage space
// #################################

Upon completion of your work, you will want to copy the content back to the central remote repository. Due to QA processes, only members of the Server WG can write directly to the central remote repository. Everyone else must create their own area in which to store their changes.

In Git terminology this is a _fork_ of the repository.

1. Open the https://forge.fedoraproject.org/server/user-documentation[Server User Documentation] repository in your browser and log in with your FAS account.
2. In the upper right corner you see a button "**Fork**". It opens a form to set the properties of your fork. Accept the default values unchanged, with the exception of the optional Description field. Select the button "Fork Repository" to create the fork.
3. The fork becomes the active window. Right around the center, you see a blue button "**HTTPS**" besides the address of your forck and a button to copy the URL.
4. Add your fork to your remote repositories.
+
Choose a descriptive name. Some recommend the name “upstream.” That's actually a bit misleading. “Upstream” usually refers to the project where the ultimate development of the project takes place. In the case of server documentation, that would be the central remote repository, not a fork, of which there are many. Maybe you should choose your username or simply “myfork.”
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git remote add {NAME} {URL}
----
+
As an example, if would use
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git remote add myfork https://forge.fedoraproject.org/pboy/user-documentation

== Isolate work on new or updated items in a separate area
// #######################################################

Working on a new article or on an update of an existing one, it is advantageous to work in a temporary space, copied mostly from the main branch, independently from modifications on other documents in the repo and without disturbing the main repo. It is especially useful, if you work on it for a longer period of time. All changes you make here will be merged back into the source, usually main, after completion.

In Git terminology this is a _branch_ inside the repository.

=== Check the central Server documentation repository for branches


When you clone the central repository as described above, Git installs just the main branch on your workspace. You have to check the central repositry for branches you are interested in and install them manually.

It is not a good idea to simply replicate all branches locally. Some branches may be outdated and no longer used. To avoid disorganization, consciously select only the branches that are relevant to your current work.

1. *List the branches* in the remote central repository
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch -a
* main
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
remotes/origin/main
remotes/origin/nfs-upd
remotes/origin/nfs_typo
remotes/origin/stg
----
+
The command lists your local branches and the branches on the remote central repository.

2. *Create a corresponding local branch* of the branch you want to work with, eg. nfs-upd in the above example
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git checkout nfs-upd
branch 'nfs-upd' set up to track 'origin/nfs-upd'.
Switched to a new branch 'nfs-upd'
----

3. *Check the result*
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch
main
* nfs-upd

[…]$ git status
On branch nfs-upd
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/nfs-upd'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
----
+
You may also get some more information about your locally available branches:
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch -v
main    1fa76ff modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc aktualisiert
* nfs-upd db0c02c fixed some typos in nfs filesharing docs and brought versions in line for FC43
----


=== Create a new branch locally

1. Ensure, that the source, usually main, is your currently active branch
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git status
* main
stg
{sometext}-upd
----
2. Otherwise switch to main.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git switch main
----
3. Update your local workspace
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git pull [origin]
----
+
The parameter is optional. The cloned repository's main branch is usually the default.

4. Create a new branch und switch to it at the same time
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>
----
+
Alternatively you can also use
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git switch -c <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>
----


=== Delete a Branch no longer needed completely locally and remotely
// ================================================================

1. Delete the remote branch
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git push -d <REMOTE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
----
2. Delete the local branch
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch -D <BRANCH_NAME>
----


== Working on content
// ==================

1. Check if you are on the branch you intend to work on
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch
* main
stg
{sometext}-upd
----

2. If not, switch to the branch you want to use.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git checkout [main|{sometext}-upd]
----
+
Git will adjust and modify the content of your working directory accordingly!

3. Before your begin to work update your working directory
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git
----

4. Modify content

5. Update preview and check:
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ ./docsbuilder.sh
----
+
Preview in your browser using the address _'localhost:8080_

6. Repeat step 4 & 5 as required.


== Save Your Work
// ==============

=== Commit your work locally
//  ==============

While working on content all modifications happen in the volotile working directory. Every change takes effect immediately; everything is in flux. To permanently save a status, the working area is saved in the local git repository (in the ".git" subdirectory). In Git, this is known as a _commit._

1. Check status
+
[…]$ git status

2. Add files to commit stage as appropriate
+
[…]$ git add <FILENAME>

3. Commit locally
+
[…]$ git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"



=== Forgot a file in the last commit
//  ================================

Add a file to the last commit without modifying the commit log message

1. Add the file (or several files) to the staging area
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ […]$ git add <FILENAME>
----

2. Add it to the last commit
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git commit  --amend  --no-edit
----

You can also add a files and replace the commit log message

1. Add the file (or several files) to the staging area
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git add <FILENAME>
----

2. Add it to the last commit
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"
----


=== Save your work in the central remote repository
//  ===============================================

=== Transfer your work into the central remote repository

Only members of Server WG can do this.


[source,]
----
[…]$ git push origin [main|]
----


=== Save your work in your fork

[source,]
----
[…]$ git push {YOUR_FORK_NAME} [main|{sometext}-upd]
----


== Invite to discuss your work
// ===========================

=== Create a Pull Request
// =====================

TBD

=== Modify a Pull Request
// =====================

== Finally publish your work
// =========================

=== Merge a branch into main
//  ==============================

1. If you are in your branch, commit all changes as described above.

2. Switch to main and update your main version
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git checkout main
[…]$ git pull main
----

3. Check whether a merge is possible without any problems.
+
[source,]
----
git merge --no-commit --no-ff {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
----

4. If there arise no conflicts, merge your branch. Otherwise resolve them as described below.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git merge {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
----

4. Save your merged main to the central remote repository
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git push
----

=== Merge a branch into stg
//  ==============================

1. If you are in your branch, commit all changes as described above.

2. Switch to stg and update your stg version
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git checkout stg
[…]$ git pull stg
----

3. Check whether a merge is possible without any problems.
+
[source,]
----
git merge --no-commit --no-ff {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
----

4. If there arise no conflicts, merge your branch. Otherwise resolve them as described below.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git merge {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
----

4. Save your merged stg to the central remote repository
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git push
----

=== Resolve a merge conflict

==== Merging into stg

1. Check whether a merge is possible without any problems.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git merge --no-commit --no-ff <YourBranch>
----

A typical issue here is, you get the files you worked on merged without any issue. But files you didn't work on can not automatically merged due to differences between main (the base of your branch) and stg.

Best strategie in this case is just to keep all those files you didn't modify and merge just those which automatically can get merged. For the above example you get
[source,]
----
[…]$ git merge  -s ort -X ours  pgsql-upd
Auto-merging modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc
Auto-merging modules/ROOT/pages/installation/postinstallation-tasks.adoc
Auto-merging modules/ROOT/pages/services/filesharing-nfs-installation.adoc

== Miscellaneous
// #############

=== Copy an article from one branch into another

*Not recommended*

Sometimes you may need an article located in onother branch in youre current work branch. An easy way is just to copy it. But be aware, this way you don't get related files, e.g. images, in one go! You have to check for file dependencies and copy one by one.

First check, if you are in the intended branch and then copy the file from another branch

[source,]
----
[…]$ git status
[…]$ git checkout <other-branch-name> <file-or-dir>
----

as an example

[source,]
----
[…]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

[…]$ git checkout gui-upd modules/ROOT/pages/usecase-gui-addon.adoc
----

=== „Cherry-pick“ a commit from another branch into your current branch
//  ===================================================================

*The recommended alternative to copy*

'Cherry-picking' picks up a commit that was made in another branch and applies that very same commit to your current branch. As with the copy command about it copies files from one branch into another, but not just one file, but all files that were processed in this commit. With regard to documents, the text file of the document and all associated files such as images, etc. will be transferred in one go.

1. Check if you are on the branch you intend to work on
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git branch
* main
stg
{sometext}-upd
{othertext}-new
----

2. If not, switch to the branch you want to use.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git switch {sometext}-upd
----

3. Skip through the log and finde the commit you want to cherry-pick
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git log

Updated minutes
----
+
Copy the commit hash to the clipboard

4. Cherry-pick the commit
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git cherry-pick [-x]  <commit-hash>
----
+
If you want to cherry-pick the minutes of the 2025-11-05 meeting of the above example, it would be
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git cherry-pick -x  29668a512ad66595a550aec08a1171e42f219d11
----
+
The abbreviated hash (the first 7 digits instead of 40), that you see in the overview in the web interface of the remote repository, too, is also sufficient. You may specify multiple commit hashes to cherry-pick multiple commits in one go.
+
The parameter "-x" is optional. It enables you to provide a standard commit message, so it might easier in the future to see, what you did and why.


=== „Cherry-pick“ a commit from a forked repo into your current branch
//  ==================================================================

1. Find the URL of the other fork or repo. In the Fedora forge Web interface click on the number right of the "Fork" button. You get a list of the currently existing forks. Select the one you want to cherry-pick and copy the URL into the clipboard.

2. Add the other repo to your remote repos. Choose a descriptive name, eg the username.
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git remote add {USERNAME} {URL}
----
+
As an example, if you want to add my fork
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git remote add pboys https://forge.fedoraproject.org/pboy/user-documentation
----

3. Fetch the branches
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git fetch  {USERNAME}
----

4. As above get the log of the other branch, find the commit you want to cherry-pick and copy the commit hash into the clipboard
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git log  {USERNAME}/{BRANCH}
----

5. Cherry-pick the commit
+
[source,]
----
[…]$ git cherry-pick {COMMIT_HASH}
----
