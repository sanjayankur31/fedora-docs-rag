= CI Manifesto =

Continuous integration is a developer/packager process and workflow.
Continuous delivery is a release process and workflow.

Continuous integration aims to ensure broken changes do not affect other developers, packagers, maintainers or users.
Continuous delivery aims to ensure broken changes do not get delivered or released.

Continuous integration allows us to rapidly course correct while building software toward a moving target.
The feedback that continuous integration provides is vital for fast paced agile delivery of software.
Late testing, long after a change occurs, does not scale to the pace of Fedora.

Because there are several Continuous Integration efforts, we need to set the basic rules to make sure we’re all playing the same game.
When we call a game “football” we need to agree on what that means.
We may have different frameworks, implementations or tests, but need to play the same game.

== The Definition ==

\&#42;You don’t get to call it “Continuous Integration” unless you \&#8230;\&#42;

. Assemble it together like in production, then test drive it like a user.
This is \&#42;Integration\&#42;.
. Do those integration tests for every single 'change'.
This is \&#42;Continuous\&#42;.

Without these, it may be “unit testing”, “acceptance testing”, “regression testing”, “quality assurance”, or other steps in the pipeline … but it’s not “continuous integration”.
You might even run the same tests again later as part of one of these other testing processes.

Building a component, composing it with others, assembling it into a production-like system, is all part of integration.
A “change stream” is how we refer to the changes that integration continuously acts upon.
A developer is someone who instigated and/or implemented the change and is our target for feedback from the tests.
In Fedora this is a packager or maintainer.
Usually we apply that integration to a stream of software changes, but at other times it is hardware changes, or other changes.

\&#42;Continuous delivery\&#42; is taking some of those successful integrations and delivering them.

== The Manifesto ==

. A test has zero value until its result affects the behavior of an observer.
. The best observer for a test result is the developer or packager who instigated and/or initiated the change being integrated.
. The benefit of continuous integration is inversely proportional to the size of the change.
Many iterative small changes far outweigh a massive bundled change.
. Rapid feedback to the developer or packager of the change will cause them to pay attention.
Aim for hours not days to provide test results.
. Packagers only take responsibility for tests that they can contribute to.
. Packagers respect tests and testing systems that produce reliable results.
Conversely they ignore and shun tests and systems that are flakey.
. Packagers should not have to search for test results outside of their workflow.
. Packagers should be able to run individual tests on their own machines.
. The ideal test can be updated in lockstep with the changes it is testing.
Aim to store a test along with the software that the test is most related to.
. The best place to test a change is before that change affects anyone else.
. A small suite of tests that follows these principles is more valuable to continuous integration than large suite of tests that does not.

== The Rules ==

\&#42;Continuous Integration becomes self-sustaining by following two basic rules \&#8230;\&#42;

In order to scale our CI effort, it must be made self-sustaining.
This is not that hard.
These basic rules are the requirements to build a self-sustaining cycle where the tests grow rather than rot.

=== 1. Tests must be changeable by people making the software change ===

Developers and packagers must be able to contribute changes to the tests and run them.
The tests become the responsibility of packagers, and the packaging cycle.
It is possible to start off with a small corpus of tests that meet this requirement.
This small corpus will eventually outpace any “non-Open Source” tests.

\&#42;Reason:\&#42; Open source, reproducible tests allow developers and packagers to contribute to, fix out of date tests, and grow the test suites.
They then pay attention to the tests and maintain them.

=== 2. Rapid Feedback to the Person who makes a Change ===

The developer or packager who makes change to a package or container needs rapid feedback from the continuous integration.
The change should not proceed until that person reacts to integration failure results.

\&#42;Reason:\&#42; Rapid feedback causes developers and packagers to

. pay attention to the tests
. fix problems while the change is fresh in their mind and
. gate the change on the tests.



= Pull Requests =

Fedora is running https://pagure.io/pagure[pagure] on the top of its dist-git at https://src.fedoraproject.org[https://src.fedoraproject.org].

Having pagure on the top of dist-git means you can use the fork/pull-request workflow.
To use this workflow there are two situations to consider:

== You are a packager ==

If you are a packager, you have ssh access to dist-git, so you can use pagure directly.
Find the repository you would like to contribute to, fork it via the \&#42;fork\&#42; button at the top right.
Wait a couple of minutes for the git repository and its access to be re-generated.
Clone locally using the ssh URL and interact with this git repo as you would do normally.

== You are \&#42;NOT\&#42; a packager ==

Contributors that are not in the packager group cannot ssh into dist-git.
This is for security reasons and will not be changed.

However, pagure on dist-git supports now pushing via https.

For this you will need the \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; package:

sudo dnf install fedpkg

To push via https, your git repository needs to be configured in a certain way (i.e. you need to have a \&#96;[credential]\&#96; section in your \&#96;.git/config\&#96;).
There are two ways you can have this.

\&#42; Clone your git repo using

fedpkg clone -a
+
for example:

fedpkg clone -a forks/pingoufpca/rpms/fedora-gather-easyfix
+
In this case fedpkg will take care of setting up correctly your git repository allowing you to push using

git push

\&#42; Clone your git repo using

git clone https://\&#8230;
+
and push using

fedpkg push
+
Here as well, fedpkg will take care of configuring correctly your git repository.

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Username/Password\&#42; +
If you ever see the CLI asking you for an username and/or password, your git repo is not correctly configured.
The only place that should be asking you for an username and password is https://id.fedoraproject.org[https://id.fedoraproject.org]

====

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;fork(s)\&#42; +
The URL used for web browsing uses 'fork/' (singular) while the path used for git uses 'forks/' (plural).

====

== Open a pull-request ==

Once you have pushed your commits to your fork, you can navigate to your fork in the UI and open the pull-request using either the \&#42;New PR\&#42; button appearing next to the branch you pushed into or on the main page of the project.

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Working with Pull Requests\&#42; +
You may encounter a situation where you want to include changes from the master branch that were made after you created your pull request.
Follow the article https://docs.pagure.org/pagure/usage/pull_requests.html\&#35;working-with-pull-requests[Working with Pull Requests]
====



= Gating =

== Enable Gating ==

Gating of packages based on test results is currently enabled on demand.
If you want to turn the gating on for your component create a new file \&#96;gating.yaml\&#96; in the root of the package dist git directory with the following content:

Enable gate to the testing repository:

--- !Policy
product_versions:
- fedora-\&#42;
decision_contexts: [bodhi_update_push_testing]
subject_type: koji_build
rules:
- !PassingTestCaseRule {test_case_name: fedora-ci.koji-build.tier0.functional}

Enable gate to the stable repository (use this one for gating rawhide):

--- !Policy
product_versions:
- fedora-\&#42;
decision_contexts: [bodhi_update_push_stable]
subject_type: koji_build
rules:
- !PassingTestCaseRule {test_case_name: fedora-ci.koji-build.tier0.functional}

TIP: In order to enable both gates, simply concatenate both examples above.

TIP: To add another test just extend the \&#96;rules\&#96; list with additional \&#96;!PassingTestCaseRule\&#96;.

This will enable gating for all Fedora releases based on the result of the CI xref:pipeline.adoc[Pipeline].
A decision context identifies set of policies used for a specific gating.
For example, \&#96;bodhi_update_push_stable\&#96; decision context is used for gating RPM builds in Bodhi updates before getting to the stable repository.

The \&#96;decision_contexts\&#96; should match in both remote rules file and the policy in the Greenwave configuration (at least one decision context).
Rules define resultsdb test cases that should be considered for the gating decision, in this case \&#96;fedora-ci.koji-build.tier0.functional\&#96;
which are tests that were run in the CI based on the xref:tmt.adoc[tmt] or xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[STI] configuration in package's dist-git.
If no tests are required for the particular decision context(s) rules should be set to an empty list, i. e. \&#96;rules: []\&#96;,
otherwise Greenwave will return, that it could not find any applicable policies.

The following Fedora CI tests can be enabled for gating:

\&#42; fedora-ci.koji-build.tier0.functional - component-specific tests enabled using xref:tmt.adoc[tmt] or xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[STI] in dist-git
\&#42; https://github.com/fedora-ci/rpmdeplint-pipeline[fedora-ci.koji-build.rpmdeplint.functional] - to make sure the update's dependencies are available
\&#42; https://github.com/fedora-ci/rpminspect-pipeline[fedora-ci.koji-build.rpminspect.static-analysis] - to check package sanity including ABI stability
\&#42; https://github.com/fedora-ci/installability-pipeline[fedora-ci.koji-build.installability.functional] - to make sure package installation / update works well

See Greenwave's https://docs.pagure.org/greenwave/package-specific-policies.html[Package-specific policies] for more technical details about setting the policy.

== Using Multiple Plans ==

If you are using multiple xref:tmt.adoc[tmt] plans it is also possible to enable gating for selected plans only.
Instead of the generic \&#96;tier0\&#96; type use the name of the desired plan in the resultsdb testcase name:

!PassingTestCaseRule {test_case_name: fedora-ci.koji-build.\&lt;plan-name\&gt;.functional}

For example, rule used to enable gating for the \&#96;/plans/basic\&#96; plan would look like this:

!PassingTestCaseRule {test_case_name: fedora-ci.koji-build./plans/basic.functional}

Before the above-mentioned rules can be used, separate plan reporting has to be enabled.
See the xref:tmt.adoc\&#35;_multiple_plans[Multiple Plans] section for details.

== Waive ==

If the failed test result is irrelevant you can waive it using the https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org[Bodhi web interface] or directly from the command line:

\&#35; List blocking test results
bodhi updates waive \&lt;id\&gt; --show

\&#35; Specify which tests to waive via:
bodhi updates waive \&lt;id\&gt; --test='dist.rpmlint' --test='atomic-ci' 'Comment explaining the waiver'

\&#35; Waive all tests:
bodhi updates waive \&lt;id\&gt; --test=all 'Comment explaining the waiver'

While the web UI only allows to waive all tests, command line provides a way to select tests which should be waived.

\&#42; Tests


= Generic Tests =


Generic tests are tests that don't check only specific components (e.g. 'dnf' or 'kernel') but can be typically applied to all artifacts of a certain type.
An example of such a test could be a test that can be run on all RPM builds in a Bodhi update.


Fedora CI currently provides 3 generic tests.
All of them run on packages that are being pushed to Rawhide via automatic Bodhi updates.


== rpmdeplint ==


\&#96;rpmdeplint\&#96; is a generic test that tries to identify problems in RPM packages in the context of their dependency graph.

There are four different checks that the test performs:


=== check-sat ===
This checks if all runtime dependencies of the given RPM packages would be satisfied if the packages are pushed to the given repository (like Rawhide).

=== check-repoclosure ===
This is similar to check check-sat test, but check-repoclosure checks that all packages in the given repository that don't have any runtime dependency problems before the new packages are added, won't have any dependency problems after the packages are added to the repository.

Packages are only considered to be available for dependency resolution if they are the latest version and not obsoleted by any other package.
Therefore this check can detect problems where a package under test is updating an existing package in the repository, but it no longer provides a requirement needed by some other package in the repository.

Packages with pre-existing repoclosure problems are ignored.

=== check-conflicts ===
This checks for undeclared file conflicts in the given RPM packages: that is when one of the given packages contains a file
which is also contained in some other package.

This command will not report a file as conflicting between two packages if:

\&#42; there is an explicit RPM Conflicts between the two packages; or

\&#42; the file’s checksum, permissions, owner, and group are identical in both packages (RPM allows both packages to own
the file in this case); or

\&#42; the file’s color is different between the two packages (RPM will silently resolve the conflict in favor of the
64-bit file).

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes files can be owned by literally thousands of different packages.
In order to properly check that there are no file conflicts, \&#96;rpmdeplint\&#96; would need to download all other packages.
This would be very slow, so only a single other package is downloaded and checked.
====

=== check-upgrade ===
Checks that there are no existing packages in the repositories which would upgrade or obsolete the given packages.

If this check fails, it means that the package under test will never be installed (since the package manager will always pick the newer or obsoleting package from the repositories instead) which is not desirable, assuming the package is intended as an update.


== rpminspect ==

RPM build deviation analysis tools.
\&#96;rpminspect\&#96; looks at the output of an RPM build (e.g., the output of a Koji build) and examines the contents of the build artifacts to report:

\&#42; Policy compliance

\&#42; Changes from a previous build to the current build
\&#42;\&#42; the previous build is the latest build in the stable repository (in Rawhide, it is simply the previous build)

\&#42; General correctness and best practices

\&#96;rpminspect\&#96; performs more than 30 different checks on packages.
To list all of them, with a nice description, please run \&#96;rpminspect -v -l\&#96;.


== installability ==

This is a generic test that tries to perform the following operations on the given packages:

\&#42; dnf install
\&#42; dnf remove
\&#42; dnf update
\&#42; dnf downgrade

All problems are logged and reported.


= Test Management Tool =

== Summary ==

The \&#96;tmt\&#96; tool aims to provide an efficient and comfortable way to create, execute, debug and enable tests in the Continuous Integration.

It implements the https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec.html[Test Metadata Specification] which allows to store all needed test execution data directly within a git repository.
The same configuration can be used for enabling tests in the Fedora CI, RHEL CI and https://packit.dev/[Packit].
Tests can be easily executed in your preferred environment, e.g. in virtual machine, container or directly on the localhost.

== First Steps ==

=== Install ===

Install tmt on your laptop:

sudo dnf install -y tmt       \&#35; basic features, executing tests on localhost
sudo dnf install -y tmt+all   \&#35; install all available tmt subpackages including all dependencies

You can also install selected provision plugins only:

sudo dnf install -y tmt+provision-container   \&#35; additional dependencies for executing tests in containers
sudo dnf install -y tmt+provision-virtual     \&#35; support for running tests in a virtual machine using testcloud

See the tmt https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html\&#35;install[install] section for more installation options.

=== Git Repo ===

Check out the desired dist git branch using fedpkg:

fedpkg clone -a bash
cd bash
git checkout f32

Or clone your GitHub project repository:

git clone https://github.com/teemtee/tmt/
cd tmt
git checkout -b enable-tests

=== Smoke Test ===

Let's enable a simple smoke test using the minimal plan template:

$ tmt init --template mini
Tree '/tmp/bash' initialized.
Applying template 'mini'.
Directory '/tmp/bash/plans' created.
Plan '/tmp/bash/plans/example.fmf' created.

Edit the newly created plan as needed, for example like this:

summary:
Basic smoke test for bash
execute:
script: bash --version

== Execute Tests ==

=== Run Tests ===

Execute all available tests safely in a virtual machine:

tmt run

Run only tests matching given name or located under the current directory:

tmt run test --name smoke
tmt run test --name .

Show detailed test results from the latest tmt run executed by current user:

tmt run --last report -fvvv

[NOTE]
====
Executing tests enabled using the Standard Test Interface in tests/tests.yml is not supported yet but we are working on it.
====


=== Select Steps ===

Explicitly choose which steps should be run:

tmt run discover

This will provide an overview of tests which would be run.
To list individual tests enable the verbose mode:

tmt run discover --verbose
tmt run discover -v


=== Provision Options ===

Choose \&#96;local\&#96; as the provision method but run \&#96;--all\&#96; steps:

tmt run --all provision --how local

Execute inside a container or virtual machine:

tmt run --all provision --how container --image fedora
tmt run --all provision --how virtual --image fedora-32

Check all available provision plugins:

tmt run provision --help

=== Prepare Options ===

Install additional packages on the guest:

tmt run --all prepare --how install --package httpd

Get the latest package from provided copr repository:

tmt run --all prepare --how install --copr @teemtee/tmt --package tmt

Use the freshly build local rpm or all rpms from provided local directory:

tmt run --all prepare --how install --package tmp/RPMS/noarch/tmt-0.20-1.fc32.noarch.rpm
tmt run --all prepare --how install --directory tmp/RPMS/noarch

Check all available prepare options:

tmt run prepare --help


== Create Test ==

In order to create more complex tests let's use the base plan template:

tmt plan create /plans/basic --template base
tmt plan create /plans/basic -t base

Update summary as needed, keep discover method to \&#96;fmf\&#96; and choose whether tests should be executed as \&#96;shell\&#96; scripts (just check the exit code) or \&#96;beakerlib\&#96; tests (investigate journal for test results):

summary:
Check basic bash features
discover:
how: fmf
execute:
how: tmt

=== Shell Test ===

In order to create a simple shell test skeleton use the shell template:

$ tmt test create /tests/smoke
Template (shell or beakerlib): shell
Directory '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke' created.
Test metadata '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke/main.fmf' created.
Test script '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke/test.sh' created.

Update metadata file:

summary: Check bash version
contact: Petr Šplíchal \&lt;psplicha@redhat.com\&gt;
test: ./test.sh

Adjust the test script as desired:

\&#35;!/bin/sh -eux
tmp=$(mktemp)
bash --version \&gt; $tmp
grep 'GNU bash' $tmp
grep 'Free Software Foundation' $tmp
rm $tmp

Use \&#96;tmt run\&#96; to verify the test is working as expected.

=== BeakerLib Test ===

Use beakerlib template to create a new beakerlib test:

$ tmt test create /tests/smoke -t beakerlib
Directory '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke' created.
Test metadata '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke/main.fmf' created.
Test script '/tmp/bash/tests/smoke/test.sh' created.

Update test metadata and code as needed, use \&#96;tmt run\&#96; to verify everything is working fine.


== Pull Requests ==

When creating the pull request make sure you add all created files including the special \&#96;.fmf\&#96; directory.

git add .
git commit

=== Fedora ===

In order to test your changes in Fedora CI no additional configuration is needed.
Make sure you push the changes into your forked repository as fedora rpms/tests namespace does not allow force-push or branch removal.

git remote add fork ssh://psss@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/psss/rpms/tmt.git
git push fork -u enable-tests

=== GitHub ===

In order to test a pull request on GitHub enable the https://github.com/marketplace/packit-as-a-service[Packit-as-a-Service] integration and add a \&#96;.packit.yaml\&#96; configuration file:

jobs:
- job: tests
trigger: pull_request
metadata:
targets:
- fedora-all

For more details see the https://packit.dev/testing-farm/[Testing Farm] documentation.
Once the integration is enabled push the branch, create a new pull request as ususal and wait for results:

git push origin -u enable-tests

=== Templates ===

When creating a pull request to enable tests in a repository with no \&#96;tmt\&#96; configuration,
include a couple of hints and links for those who are not familiar with the new tooling:

\&#8230;.
This pull request enables tests in the Fedora CI using \&#96;tmt\&#96; which
also allows to easily execute and debug tests from your laptop:

Run tests directly on your localhost:

sudo dnf install -y tmt
tmt run --all provision --how local

Run tests in a virtual machine:

sudo dnf install -y tmt+provision-virtual
tmt run

Check the documentation to learn more about the tool:
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/tmt/
\&#8230;.


== Manage Tests ==

Explore available tests, convert old metadata, share test code.

=== Explore Tests ===

In order to see which tests are available:

tmt test ls

To show more details about individual tests:

tmt test show

To see an overview of all metadata:

tmt

Explore all available options and commands using \&#96;--help\&#96;.

=== Share Tests ===

Test code does not have to reside in the same git repository (e.g. dist git rpms namespace).
It is possible to store tests in a dedicated repository and share them across components or product versions.
You only need to reference the repository in the discover step. Use the full plan template to get quickly started:

tmt plan create /plans/upstream -t full

Update the repository url to point to the right place:

summary:
Essential command line features
discover:
how: fmf
url: https://github.com/teemtee/tmt
execute:
how: tmt

Now you will be able to run tests from the remote repository.
See the https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/steps.html\&#35;discover[discover] step documentation for details.


== Various Hints ==

=== Multiple Commands ===

Multiple shell commands can be provided under the \&#96;script\&#96; attribute as well:

summary:
Basic smoke test for bash
execute:
script:
- bash --version
- bash -c 'echo $((1+1+1))' | grep 3

See the https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/plans.html\&#35;script[script] method documentation for details.

=== Installing Dependencies ===

Required packages can be installed using the \&#96;prepare\&#96; attribute:

summary: Basic smoke test for python3-m2crypto
prepare:
how: install
package:
- python3-setuptools
- python3-m2crypto
execute:
script: python3 -c 'import M2Crypto'

See the https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/plans.html\&#35;prepare[prepare] step documentation for details.

=== Multiple Repositories ===

In the discover step it is possible to reference multiple repositories as well.
In this way you can for example easily execute both upstream and fedora tests as part of a single plan:

discover:
- name: fedora
how: fmf
url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux.git
- name: upstream
how: fmf
url: https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-testsuite

See also https://github.com/teemtee/tmt/blob/main/examples/multiple/basic.fmf[multiple config] example in tmt repo to get a better idea.

=== Multiple Plans ===

It is possible to use multiple plans to group relevant tests together or to be able to easily run a subset of tests.
For example, let's have a \&#96;/plans/features\&#96; plan which covers all functionality tests from the local git repository:

discover:
how: fmf
execute:
how: tmt

And a separate \&#96;/plans/integration\&#96; plan to enable integration testing with another component:

discover:
how: fmf
url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ltrace.git
execute:
how: tmt

Running all tests from given plan is then very easy:

tmt run plan --name /plans/features

When run in the CI, results from such plans are reported as a single resultsdb testcase and are shown in pull requests as a single flag.
In order to enable separate result for each plan, create a \&#96;ci.fmf\&#96; file in the git repository root with the following content:

resultsdb-testcase: separate

Once the separate reporting is enabled, you can turn on gating for selected plans only.
Plan name becomes part of the resultsdb testcase name which is used in the \&#96;gating.yaml\&#96; config.
See the gating documentation on xref:gating.adoc\&#35;_using_multiple_plans[Using Multiple Plans] for more details.


=== Minimal Path ===

Here is an example of a minimal test creation path:

dnf install -y tmt+all
git clone https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash
cd bash
tmt init -t mini
vim plans/example.fmf
tmt run

A slightly extended example with custom test and plan template and executing test directly on the local host:

dnf install -y tmt+all
git clone https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash
cd bash
tmt init
tmt plan create --template base plans/smoke
tmt test create --template beakerlib tests/smoke
vim plans/smoke.fmf tests/smoke/\&#42;
tmt run --all provision -h local
git add .
git commit -m 'Enable basic tests'
git push

=== Virtualization Tips ===

In order to safely run tests under a virtual machine started on your laptop you only need to install the \&#96;tmt+provision-virtual\&#96; package.
By default the session connection is used so no other steps should be needed, just execute tests using the \&#96;tmt run\&#96; command.
See the upstream https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/questions.html\&#35;virtualization-tips[Virtualization Tips] for more options.

== Questions ==

Does the tool replace/deprecate STI?::
No, currently there is no plan to decommission STI.
Both \&#96;tmt\&#96; and \&#96;sti\&#96; approach to CI configuration can be used in parallel.

Are these tests supported in Fedora CI?::
Yes, Fedora CI support is enabled for all active branches and the tests namespace as well.

Which Linux distributions does the tool support?::
As a system under test (on which the tests are executed) all supported Fedora versions, Centos 6+ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6+ can be used.
For the test runner (where tmt command is run) all supported Fedora versions, Centos 8+ or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8+ are required.



= Share Test Code =

== Motivation ==

In order to make the CI workflow reliable and efficient it is crucial to keep the test coverage in a good shape at all times.
Sharing test code between several packages (even within multiple branches of the same package) may significantly help to:

\&#42; Prevent test code duplication
\&#42; Minimize test maintenance
\&#42; Catch incompatibilities early

In general, tests define how the software works and the basic functionality of many packages doesn’t change that often.
We try hard to keep the backward compatibility where possible.
Thus it seems natural that, for such components, tests guarding the spec could change at a slower pace than the distribution branches.

See the whole https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/ci@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/55U6V6UHA54MJLD2F6JF46EOLMVRUAE7[ci-list discussion] for some more context.

== Implementation ==

Store test code in your preferred repository and reference the tests from the dist-git yaml file.
There is also a special \&#96;tests\&#96; namespace dedicated for storing Fedora CI integration tests:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/projects/tests/\&#42;

Use \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; to quickly clone repositories from the tests namespace:

fedpkg clone tests/shell

=== tmt ===

Enabling tests from a remote repository using xref:tmt.adoc[tmt] is straightforward:

[source,yaml]
----
discover:
how: fmf
url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git
----

See the https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/plans.html\&#35;fmf[discover] step documentation for more details.

=== STI ===

Some of the xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] (currently basic and beakerlib) support fetching test code from remote repositories directly in their config in this way:

[source,ansible]
----
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
----

It is also possible to specify version (branch, commit hash) which should be fetched from the remote repository:

[source,ansible]
----
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
version: 'devel'
----

== Testing Tests ==

It is a good idea to ensure that updating tests in the shared repository does not negatively impact packages which they are testing.
To enable pull request pipeline for tests stored in the Fedora dist git tests namespace simply include \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file in the root of the test repository.

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
tests:
- smoke27:
dir: smoke
run: VERSION=2.7 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
- smoke36:
dir: smoke
run: VERSION=3.6 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
- smoke37:
dir: smoke
run: VERSION=3.7 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
required_packages:
- python27
- python36
- python37
----

The example above is a simplified version of the https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/python/blob/main/f/tests.yml[tests.yml] file from the Python shared test repo and shows how to enable \&#96;smoke\&#96; test to be executed against three versions of the Python interpreter.

== Examples ==

Here are some real-life examples where sharing test code can increase long-term efficiency.

=== Shell ===

There are several shells which implement the POSIX specification:

\&#42; bash
\&#42; ksh
\&#42; mksh
\&#42; zsh
\&#42; dash

All of them share a significant amount of test coverage and it does not make sense to commit \&amp; maintain identical tests in five different repositories (+ possible branches).

Shell tests repository:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell

Bash https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[tests.yml]:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
tests:
- shell/func
- shell/login
- shell/smoke
required_packages:
- expect            \&#35; login requires expect
- which             \&#35; smoke requires which
----

Ksh https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ksh/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[tests.yml]:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
tests:
- shell/func
- shell/login
- shell/smoke
environment:
PACKAGES: ksh
SH_BIN: ksh
required_packages:
- ksh
- expect            \&#35; login requires expect
- which             \&#35; smoke requires which
----

=== Ruby ===

Another example is Ruby: With about 80 packages related to Ruby on Rails it would be useful and efficient to have a single place for integration tests which verify that the framework is correctly working after updating any of these packages.
Conversely, maintaining those tests in 80 repos would be a tedious task.

Currently the shared https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/ruby[tests/ruby] repository hosts these three ruby integration tests:

\&#42; systemtap-static-probes-in-ruby - exercising ruby's systemtap api
\&#42; bundler-unit-test - run bundler's unit tests
\&#42; run-basic-rails-application - run a simple rails application

=== SELinux ===

Several SELinux user space components are sharing test coverage in a single https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux.git[selinux] test repository:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libsepol/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libsepol]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libselinux/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libselinux]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libsemanage/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libsemanage]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libsepol/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[policycoreutils]

== Start ==

In order to create a new repository in the tests namespace use the fedpkg's \&#96;request-tests-repo\&#96; command.
For example to create a shared test repository with the name foo, which will be available at https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/foo.git

\&#42; Setup authentication to pagure according to the help in request-repo command

fedpkg request-repo -h

\&#42; Request a new repository with a sensible decription

fedpkg request-tests-repo foo 'Description of the repository'



\&#42;\&#42; STI tests

= Standard Test Interface =

Standard Discovery, Staging and Invocation of Integration Tests.

Version: \&#96;2.0.0\&#96;

== Summary ==

Let's define a clear delineation of between a _test suite_ (including framework) and the CI system that is running the test suite.
This is the standard interface.
What follows is a standard way to discover, package and invoke integration tests for a package stored in a Fedora dist-git repo.

Many Fedora packages have unit tests.
These tests are typically run during a \&#96;%check\&#96; RPM build step and run in a build root.
On the other hand, integration testing should happen against a composed system.
Upstream projects have integration tests,
both Fedora QA and the Atomic Host team would like to create more integration tests,
Red Hat would like to bring integration tests upstream.

== Benefit to Fedora ==

Developers benefit by having a consistent target for how to describe tests,
while also being able to execute them locally while debugging issues or iterating on tests.

By staging and invoking tests consistently in Fedora we create an eco-system for the tests
that allows varied test frameworks as well as CI system infrastructure to interoperate.
The integration tests outlast the implementation details of either the frameworks they're written in or the CI systems running them.

== Definitions ==

=== Terminology ===

Test Subject::
The items that are to be tested.
Examples: RPMs, OCI image, ISO, QCow2, Module repository \&#8230;

Test::
A callable/runnable piece of code and corresponding test data and mocks which exercises and evaluates a _test subject_.

Test environment::
Environment where actual test run takes place.
Test has direct impact on test environment.

Test Suite:: The collection of all tests that apply to a _test subject_.

Test Framework::
A library or component that the _test suite_ and _tests_ use to accomplish their job.
Examples: https://avocado-framework.github.io/[Avocado],
https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/InstalledTests[GNOME Installed Tests],
https://github.com/fedora-modularity/meta-test-family/[Meta Test Family],
https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-host-tests[Ansible tests in Atomic Host],
https://tunir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Tunir tests], docker test images\&#8230;

Test Result::
A boolean pass/fail output of a _test suite_.
Test results_ are for consumption by automated aspects of a _testing systems_.

Test Artifact::
Any additional output of the test suite such as the stdout/stderr output, log files, screenshots, core dumps, or TAP/Junit/subunit streams.
_Test artifacts_ are for consumption by humans, archival or big data analysis.

Testing System::
A CI or other _testing system_ that would like to discover, stage and invoke tests for a _test subject_.
Examples: https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins],
https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/[Taskotron],
https://docs.openstack.org/infra/zuul/[ZUUL],
https://ci.centos.org/[CentOS CI],
https://github.com/projectatomic/papr[Papr],
https://travis-ci.org/[Travis],
https://semaphoreci.com/[Semaphore],
https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/continuous-integration.html[Openshift CI/CD],
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration/AutopkgtestInfrastructure[Ubuntu CI]\&#8230;

Test Runner::
_Testing system_ delegates running of the test to _test runner_ which can be different from _test environment_.
For example ansible is run on the _test runner_ and tests are executed on the managed host.
Usually a stable version of OS is used for _test runner_.

=== Results Format ===

The following format should be used to report results of individual tests in the \&#96;results.yml\&#96; file:

results:
- {result: pass, test: test1, logs: [test1.log]}
- {result: fail, test: test2, logs: [test2.log, debug.log]}
- {result: error, test: test3, logs: [test3.log, debug.log, error.log]}

result:: Test result. One of \&#96;pass\&#96;, \&#96;fail\&#96; or \&#96;error\&#96;. Mandatory.
test:: Test name. A unique identifier. Mandatory.
logs::
One or more logs with detailed test output. Optional.
Path should be relative to the artifacts directory.
Some user interfaces might show only a single log by default.
In that case first log from the list should be presented to the user.

The \&#96;result\&#96; field can contain following values:

pass:: Test has successfully finished and passed.
fail:: Test has successfully finished and failed.
error:: There has been a problem with test execution.


== Responsibilities ==

The \&#42;Testing System\&#42; is responsible to:

\&#42; Build or otherwise acquire the _test subject_, such as a package, container image, tree\&#8230;
\&#42; Decide which _test suite_ to run, often by using the standard interface to discover appropriate _tests_ for the dist-git repo that a test subject originated in.
\&#42; Schedule, provision or orchestrate a job to run the _test suite_ on appropriate compute, storage\&#8230;
\&#42; Stage the _test suite_ as described by the _standard interface_.
\&#42; Invoke the _test suite_ as described by the _standard interface_.
\&#42; Gather the _test results_ and _test artifacts_ as described by the _standard interface_.
\&#42; Announce and relay the _test results_ and _test artifacts_ for gating, archival\&#8230;

The \&#42;Standard Interface\&#42; describes how to:

\&#42; Discover a _test suite_ for a given dist-git repo.
\&#42; Uniquely identify a _test suite_.
\&#42; Stage a _test suite_ and its dependencies such as _test frameworks_.
\&#42; Provide the _test subject_ to the _test suite_.
\&#42; Invoke a _test suite_ in a consistent way.
\&#42; Gather _test results_ and _test artifacts_ from the invoked _test suite_.

The \&#42;Test Suite\&#42; is responsible to:

\&#42; Declare its dependencies such as a _test framework_ via the _standard interface_.
\&#42; Execute the _test framework_ as necessary.
\&#42; Provision (usually locally) any containers or virtual machines necessary for testing the _test subject_.
\&#42; Provide _test results_ and _test subjects_ back according to the standard

The format of the textual logs and _test artifacts_ that come out of a test suite is not prescribed by this document.
Nor is it envisioned to be standardized across all possible _test suites_.

== Requirements ==

\&#42; The _test suite_ and _test framework_ SHOULD NOT leak its implementation details into the testing system, other than via the _standard interface_.
\&#42; The _test suite_ and _test framework_ SHOULD NOT rely on the behavior of the testing system other than the _standard interface_.
\&#42; The _standard interface_ MUST enable a dist-git packager to run a _test suite_ locally.
\&#42;\&#42; _Test suites_ or _test frameworks_ MAY call out to the network for certain tasks.
\&#42; It MUST be possible to stage an upstream _test suite_ using the _standard interface_.
\&#42; Both _in-situ tests_, and more rigorous _outside-in tests_ MUST be possible with the _standard interface_.
\&#42;\&#42; For _in-situ tests_ the _test suite_ is in the same file system tree and process space as the _test subject_.
\&#42;\&#42; For _outside-in tests_ the _test suite_ is outside of the file system tree and process space of the _test subject_.
\&#42; The _test suite_ and _test framework_ SHOULD be able to provision containers and virtual machines necessary for its testing without requesting them from the _testing system_.
\&#42; The _standard interface_ SHOULD describe how to uniquely identify a _test suite_.

== Detailed Description ==

This standard interface describes how to discover, stage and invoke tests.
It is important to cleanly separate implementation details of the _testing system_ from the _test suite_ and its framework.
It is also important to allow Fedora packagers to locally and manually invoke a _test suite_.

First see the link:\&#35;_terminology[Terminogy], division of link:\&#35;_responsibilities[Responsibilities] and link:\&#35;_requirements[Requirements].

=== Staging ===

Tests files will be added into the \&#96;tests/\&#96; folder of a dist-git repository branch.
The structure of the files and folders is left to the liberty of the packagers but there are one or more playbooks in the \&#96;tests/\&#96; folder that can be invoked to run the test suites.

. The _testing system_ SHOULD stage the tests on target (eg: Fedora) operating system appropriate for the branch name of the dist-git repository containing the tests.
. The _testing system_ SHOULD stage a clean _test runner_ for each set of tests it runs.
. The _testing system_ MUST stage the following package on the _test runner_:
.. \&#96;standard-test-roles\&#96;
. The _testing system_ MUST clone the dist-git repository for the test on the _test runner_, and checks out the appropriate branch.
. The contents of \&#96;/etc/yum.repos.d\&#96; on the \&#42;staged system\&#42; SHOULD be replaced with repository information that reflects the known good Fedora packages corresponding to the branch of the dist-git repository.
.. The _testing system_ MAY use multiple repositories, including _updates_ or _updates-testing_ to ensure this.

=== Invocation ===

The testing system MUST run each playbook matching the glob \&#96;tests/tests\&#42;.yml\&#96; in the dist-git repo.
Each of these files constitutes a test suite.
Each test suite is invoked by the testing system independently and executed in a clear test environment as follows.

The _test subjects_ are passed to the playbook and inventory as operating system environment and ansible environment.
Often only one _test subject_ is passed in.
However multiple subjects may be concatenated together in a shell escaped string.
The playbooks and/or inventory script split the string.
The extensions as follows are used to determine the type of subject:

\&#42;.rpm:: Absolute path to an RPM file
\&#42;.repo:: Absolute repo filenames appropriate for \&#96;/etc/yum.repos.d\&#96;
\&#42;.qcow2, \&#42;.qcow2c:: Absolute path to one virtual machine disk image bootable with cloud-init
\&#42;.oci:: Absolute path of one OCI container image filesystem bundle
docker:\&#42;:: Fully qualified path to a docker image in a registry
\&#8230;:: Other _test subject_ identifiers may be added later.

Various _tests_ in a playbook constitute a _test suite_.
Some parts of these _test suites_ will run in certain contexts, against certain deliverable artifacts.
Certain tests will run against Atomic Host deliverables, while others will not.
Certain tests will run against Docker deliverables while others will not.
This is related to, but does not exactly overlap with the _test subject_ identifiers above.
Ansible tags are used to denote these contexts.

atomic:: Atomic Host
container:: A Docker or OCI container
classic:: Tested against a classic installed YUM/DNF installed system.
\&#8230;:: Other _test subject_ identifiers may be added later.

To invoke the tests, the _testing system_ must perform the following
tasks for each _test suite_ playbook:

. MUST execute the playbook with the following operating system environment variables:
.. \&#96;TEST_SUBJECTS\&#96;: The _test subjects_ string as described above
.. \&#96;TEST_ARTIFACTS\&#96;: The full path of an empty folder for _test artifacts_
. SHOULD execute the playbook with all Ansible tags best represent the intended _test context_.
.. The choice of _test context_ tags is related to the _test subject_ being tested
. MUST execute Ansible with inventory set to the full path of the file or directory \&#96;tests/inventory\&#96; if it exists.
.. If the \&#96;tests/inventory\&#96; file doesn't exist, then \&#96;/usr/share/ansible/inventory\&#96; SHOULD be used as a default.
. MUST execute the playbook as root.
. MUST execute the playbook passing \&#96;git_branch\&#96; as ansible variable.
.. The branch used to clone tests\&#42;.yml
. MUST examine the exit code of the playbook. A zero exit code means tests completed successfully, non-zero means a problem with running tests.
. MUST examine the file \&#96;results.yml\&#96; in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; folder to detect whether tests passed of failed.
. MUST treat the file \&#96;test.log\&#96; in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; folder as the main readable output of the test.
. SHOULD place the textual stdout/stderr of the \&#96;ansible-playbook\&#96; command in the \&#96;ansible.log\&#96; file in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; folder.
. SHOULD treat the contents of the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; folder as the _test artifacts_.

Each _test suite_ playbook or _test framework_ contained therein:

. SHOULD drop privileges appropriately if the _test suite_ should be run as non-root.
. MUST install any requirements of its _test suite_ or _test framework_ and MUST fail if this is not possible.
. MUST provision the _test subject_ listed in the \&#96;subjects\&#96; variable appropriately for its playbook name (described above) and MUST fail if this is not possible.
. MUST place the main readable output of the _test suite_ into a \&#96;test.log\&#96; file in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; variable folder. This MUST happen even if some of the test suites fail.
. SHOULD place additional _test artifacts_ in the folder defined in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; variable.
. MUST return a zero exit code of the playbook if tests have been executed successfully, or a non-zero exit code if failed to run any test (e.g. because of an infrastructure error).
. MUST create a \&#96;results.yml\&#96; file in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; directory with test results in the _results format_ defined above.

If an inventory file or script exists, it:

. MUST describe where to invoke the playbook and how to connect to that target.
. SHOULD launch or install any supported \&#96;$TEST_SUBJECTS\&#96; so that the playbook can be invoked against them.
. SHOULD put relevant logs in the \&#96;$TEST_ARTIFACTS\&#96; directory.

=== Discovery ===

Test discovery is done via dist-git.
Both packages and modules may have tests in this format.
To list which _test context_ a given dist-git directory or playbook is relevant for,
use a command like the following:

ansible-playbook --list-tags tests.yml

== Scope ==

Since the tests are added in a sub-folder of the dist-git repo,
there are no changes required to the Fedora infrastructure and will have no impact on the packagers' workflow and tooling.

Only the testing system will need to be taught to install the requirements and run the playbooks.

== User Experience ==

A standard way to package, store and run tests benefits Fedora stability, and makes Fedora better for users.

\&#42; This structure makes it easy to run locally thus potentially reproducing an error triggered on the test system.
\&#42; Ansible is being more and more popular, thus making it easier for people to contribute new tests
\&#42; Used by a lot of sys-admin, ansible could help sys-admin to bring test-cases to the packagers and developers about situation where something failed for them.

== Diagram ==

image::sti-diagram.jpeg[]

== Upgrade/compatibility impact ==

There are no real upgrade or compatibility impact.
The tests will be branched per release as spec files are branched dist-git is now.

== Proposals and Evaluation ==

During the selection process for a standard test invocation and layout format for Fedora,
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/InvokingTestsProposals[several proposals] were examined.

= Standard Test Roles =

Package \&#96;standard-test-roles\&#96; provides shared Ansible roles and inventory scripts implementing the xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[Standard Test Interface] version \&#96;1.1.0\&#96;.
It has support for multiple testing frameworks (such as BeakerLib or Avocado) and in this way allows to easily enable existing tests in Fedora CI.

== Setup ==

=== Packages ===

STR is available for Centos/RHEL from https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL repository].
As the first step install all necessary packages:

sudo dnf install fedpkg libselinux-python standard-test-roles

You can also install the latest version from the copr repo:

sudo dnf copr -y enable @osci/standard-test-roles
sudo dnf update standard-test-roles

=== Artifacts ===

Output of the test (such as the stdout/stderr output, log files or screenshots) is by default saved in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; directory.
Use \&#96;TEST_ARTIFACTS\&#96; environment variable to choose a different location if desired:

export TEST_ARTIFACTS=/tmp/artifacts

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Artifacts cleanup\&#42; +
Before running tests make sure that all logs \&#96;/tmp/artifacts/test.\&#42;\&#96; are deleted.
====

=== Inventory ===

A _test subject_ is what we call the thing to be tested.
To turn a test subject into a launched, installed system to be tested, we use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[Ansible dynamic inventory].
Use the following command to enable it:

export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=$(test -e inventory \&amp;\&amp; echo inventory || echo /usr/share/ansible/inventory)

As you can see from the way how the inventory is set, tests may contain their own inventory, which defines their own instructions for turning a _test subject_ into one or more testable systems.

== Testing ==

=== Classic ===

You can always invoke the tests locally.
Many tests modify or change the system they are run against, so take that into account when looking at how to invoke tests.
The following examples invoke tests against the same system that the package git repository is checked out on.
Below there are further options for invoking tests against another fully formed and integrated systems, such as an Atomic Host or container image _test subject_.

There may be more than one test present in a package git repository.
Testing system will run each playbook matching the glob \&#96;tests/tests\&#42;.yml\&#96; separately in a clean environment.
Most often a single \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file is used as the main entry point.
To run it use the following command:

ansible-playbook tests.yml

You can find output artifacts of the tests in an \&#96;artifacts/\&#96; or specify a specific directory like this:

TEST_ARTIFACTS=/tmp/output ansible-playbook tests.yml

You can filter which kinds of tests are run by providing a \&#96;--tags\&#96; argument.
To only run tests that are suited for classic systems installed by \&#96;yum\&#96; or \&#96;dnf\&#96; you can use a command like:

ansible-playbook --tags=classic tests.yml

When run by a CI System the tests are invoked according to the xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[Standard Test Interface].
Look here for more details and standard invocation variables.

=== Package ===

When you run the tests as above, the tests assume that the system to be tested is the same as the system invoking the tests.
In particular, the test assumes that the thing to be tested is already installed.

A _test subject_ is what we call the thing to be tested.
RPMs are a particular kind of _test subject_.
To turn a test subject into a launched, installed system to be tested, we use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[Ansible dynamic inventory].
Let's invoke the tests with an inventory and a specific version of gzip:

curl -o gzip.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/gzip/1.8/2.fc26/x86_64/gzip-1.8-2.fc26.x86_64.rpm
export TEST_SUBJECTS=$PWD/gzip.rpm
ansible-playbook tests.yml

You'll notice that the RPM is installed into the testable system before invoking the tests.
Some tests contain their own inventory, that is their own instructions for turning a _test subject_ into one or more testable systems.
But in this case we use the default \&#96;standard-test-roles\&#96; inventory in \&#96;/usr/share/ansible/inventory\&#96; to do this.

=== Container ===

Another example is to use a _test subject_ of a container image.
This is also a fully formed and integrated deliverable.
The _test subject_ again represents the thing to be tested.
For testing containers there is an additional dependency needed:

sudo dnf install standard-test-roles-inventory-docker

The container image is pulled from a registry and launched using docker by an http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[Ansible dynamic inventory].

export TEST_SUBJECTS=docker:docker.io/library/fedora:27
ansible-playbook --tags=container tests.yml

If you watch closely you'll notice the image is pulled if not already local, launched as a container, and then prepared for the tests to run on.
The first time this may take a little longer.
Not all tests are able to function in the somewhat different environment of a container.
In fact, for certain tests, the software to be tested may not be included in the container.
But many of the tests for core packages should work here.

The \&#96;--tags\&#96; argument filters out tests that are not suitable for running in a container, either because the system functions differently, or the correct packages are not installable.

See the \&lt;\&lt;_debug\&gt;\&gt; section for instructions how to log into a running container and diagnose why the tests failed.

==== Additional arguments for Docker ====

Tests for containers are run with a help of Docker.
Containers are run within default security context.
For more info see https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/[Seccomp security profiles for Docker].
It is possible that some tests require additional privileges.
In this case specify necessary arguments for Docker using an environment variable \&#96;TEST_DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS\&#96;.
For this create a file \&#96;inventory\&#96; file in \&#96;tests\&#96; directory with the following content:

\&#35;!/bin/bash
export TEST_DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS='--security-opt seccomp:unconfined'
exec merge-standard-inventory '$@'

or

\&#35;!/bin/bash
export TEST_DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS='--privileged'
exec merge-standard-inventory '$@'

See https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/scripts/README.md[merge-standard-inventory] documentation for details.

=== Atomic ===

The former example may seem a bit contrived, but the concept of a _test subject_ starts to make more sense when you want to test a fully formed and integrated deliverable, such as Atomic Host.
The _test subject_ again represents the thing to be tested.
The _test subject_ in this case is a QCow2 image.
To turn a test subject into a launched system ready to be tested, we use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[Ansible dynamic inventory].

curl -Lo /tmp/atomic.qcow2 https://getfedora.org/atomic_qcow2_latest
export TEST_SUBJECTS=/tmp/atomic.qcow2
ansible-playbook --tags=atomic tests.yml

If you watch closely you'll see that the Atomic Host image is booted, and the tests run against the launched image.
Not all tests are able to function in the somewhat different environment of Atomic Host, in fact, for certain cases, the software to be tested may not be included in the Atomic Host _test subject_.
But most of the tests in core packages should work here.

Some tests contain their own inventory, that is their own instructions for turning a _test subject_ into one or more testable systems.
But in this case we use the default \&#96;standard-test-roles\&#96; inventory to do this.

The \&#96;--tags\&#96; argument filters out tests that are not suitable for running on an Atomic Host, either because the system functions differently, or the correct packages are not available on that system.

See the \&lt;\&lt;_debug\&gt;\&gt; section to learn how to diagnose why the tests failed, and log into the running Atomic Host.


[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Required Packages\&#42; +
are specified in \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; for Atomic Host, additional packages will be installed using the \&#96;rpm-ostree\&#96; command which is affecting the test subject (it's similar as rebuilding an rpm package to be tested) so this should be used with caution and only when necessary.
Also be aware that there are certain limitations for this approach (e.g. it's not possible to install different version of packages that are already part of the tree).
====

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Required Packages\&#42; +
Atomic Host is shipped as a base ostree image, however you can install additional packages with a help of \&#96;rpm-ostree install\&#96; command.
Currently (10.01.2018 )  repo with additional packages is actual only for the latest base-ostree image.
Consequence: tests that install additional packages for Atomic Host can fail sometimes with: \&#96;error: The following base packages would be replaced: xxx\&#96; Solution: make sure you have the latest Atomic Host image.
Additional information you can find https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/415[rpm-ostree issue 415] and a possible solution in the feature using \&#96;rpm-ostree jigdo\&#96; https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1081[rpm-ostree issue 1081].
====

=== Debug ===

To increase output verbosity use option \&#96;-v\&#96; or \&#96;-vvv\&#96;:

ansible-playbook --tags=container tests.yml -v

or for full verbosity:

ansible-playbook --tags=container tests.yml -vvv

To debug tests in a running container or atomic host use the \&#96;TEST_DEBUG\&#96; environment variable.
After the playbook runs, you'll see diagnosis information with a helpful command to log in.

export TEST_DEBUG=1

For container you'll see output like this:

DIAGNOSE: docker exec -it 56de801f0ddde36fc9770666f7be2a68f89d7f18f52b7b6fe7df7a12b193bf08 /bin/bash
DIAGNOSE: kill 18261 \&#35; when finished

For atomic host the instructions are a bit different:

DIAGNOSE: ssh -p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null root@127.0.0.3 \&#35; password: foobar
DIAGNOSE: export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/tmp/inventory-cloudxyhF2M/inventory
DIAGNOSE: kill 16611 \&#35; when finished

Now you can easily connect using these commands.
Use suggested \&#96;kill\&#96; command to finish the running instance when done with investigation.

== Roles ==

Here's the list of currently supported roles for test execution:

https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-avocado[standard-test-avocado]::
Role for executing tests written via the Avocado testing framework
https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-basic[standard-test-basic]::
A simple role for executing runtest.sh scripts, or other scripts in given directories
https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-beakerlib[standard-test-beakerlib]::
Role for executing tests written via Beakerlib testing framework, supporting all testing environments

Here's list of currently supported helper roles:

https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-repo[standard-test-repo]::
A role for installing packages from additional yum repositories
https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-rpm[standard-test-rpm]::
A role for installing additional rpms
https://pagure.io/standard-test-roles/blob/master/f/roles/standard-test-source[standard-test-source]::
A role for extracting upstream source tarball (with tests)

=== BeakerLib ===

This is the recommended role for running tests written via the https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib[Beakerlib Testing Framework] as it supports all currenlty supported testing environments (atomic, classic, container).
It also supports https://pagure.io/beakerlib-libraries[beakerlib-libraries] which allow easy code reuse among multiple tests.

To use this role create \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file with contents similar to the following snippet.
The \&#96;tests\&#96; parameter should include the list of directories with your beakerlib tests.
[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
tags:
- atomic
- classic
- container
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tests:
- cmd-line-options
----

The \&#96;required_packages\&#96; parameter can be used to list additional packages that need to be installed on the system to run tests.
If you have required packages correctly specified in the beakerlib test metadata (in Makefile \&#96;RhtsRequires\&#96; stands for hard requirements, \&#96;Requires\&#96; for soft requirements) it is not necessary to list them again here.

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
tags:
- atomic
- classic
- container
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tests:
- cmd-line-options
required_packages:
- which         \&#35; which package required for cmd-line-options
- rpm-build     \&#35; upstream-testsuite requires rpmbuild command
- libtool       \&#35; upstream-testsuite requires libtool
- gettext       \&#35; upstream-testsuite requires gettext
----

[NOTE]
====
The \&#96;required_packages\&#96; parameter is ignored when running on Atomic Host--since there is no way to install additional packages in that environment.
====

Instead of manually listing all tests to be executed it is also possible to provide an fmf filter in the following way:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
fmf_filter: 'tier: 1'
----

Filter can be used also if tests are stored directly in the git:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
fmf_filter: 'tier: 1'
----

See https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/metadata[Metadata] for more info about filtering tests based on fmf metadata.

=== Basic ===

Basic role can be used for executing scripts or binaries as simple tests.
For example the following \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file will run \&#96;binary --help\&#96; as a shell command in the current directory and provide pass/fail based on its return code:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
tests:
- simple:
dir: .
run: binary --help
----

Here's another example \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file which fetches a single integration test from a shared repository and uses parametrizing to run it multiple times with different environment variables:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/python.git'
dest: 'python'
tests:
- smoke27:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=2.7 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
- smoke37:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=3.7 ./venv.sh
required_packages:
- python27
- python37
- python2-virtualenv
- python3-virtualenv
- python2-devel
- python3-devel
----

= How to add simple STI test for a package =

== Test as a single command ==
=== Task ===

There is a package \&#42;somepackage\&#42;, which contains a binary:
\&#42;/usr/bin/somebinary\&#42;

The most simple and obvious way to test this binary is to run it:
\&#42;somebinary --help\&#42; and check the exit status of the result.

How to add this test for the package?

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/standard-test-roles/[Standard
Test Roles] framework provides solution for the task. It is fully
supported in Fedora Rawhide.

=== Solution ===

Create file \&#96;tests/tests.yml\&#96; in the dist-git of the package:

.rpms/somepackage.git:
----
.
├── 0001-something.patch
├── somepackage.spec
├── sources
└── tests
└── tests.yml
----

\&#42;tests.yml\&#42; is an ansible playbook, where you describe test environment
and steps to run your tests.

There are many options and
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CI/Examples[examples available], but
let's focus on the task at hand: we want to run just one command.

For this case the content of the file should look as follows:

.rpms/somepackage.git:tests/tests.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic                         // \&lt;1\&gt;
tags:
- classic
tests:
- simple:
dir: .
run: 'somebinary --help'                      // \&lt;2\&gt;
----
\&lt;1\&gt; this is a standard test role, it takes care of the test environment, logging, archiving results, etc
\&lt;2\&gt; this is your test command, its exit code defines the outcome of the test

Submit your change as a pull request to see test results in Pagure
interface, or push it directly to dist-git and get new test results
every time you build package in Koji.

NOTE: Test will be running in a \&#42;non-blocking\&#42; mode until you configure
gating for it.

== Tests in a (sub)package ==

=== Task ===

There is a package \&#96;somepackage\&#96;, and there is an integration test suite
for it packaged in a separate \&#96;sometests\&#96; package, which provides the
\&#96;run_some_tests\&#96; binary in the system path.

There goal is to trigger this binary as a test for a main package.

=== Solution ===

Same as above, you need to create a \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; configuration file with
the following content:

.rpms/somepackage.git:tests/tests.yml
[source,yaml]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
required_packages:
- sometests                    \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;

tests:
- integration_tests:            \&#35; \&lt;2\&gt;
dir: .
run: run_some_tests         \&#35; \&lt;3\&gt;
----
\&lt;1\&gt; additional package which needs to be installed in the test environment
\&lt;2\&gt; any string, will be used as identifier for artifacts and test results
\&lt;3\&gt; test execution command

== Tests in the source tarball ==


== Tests in external repository ==

=== Task ===

Let's look into slightly more complicated setup now.

Suppose there is a package \&#96;somepackage\&#96; which we are going to
test. There is an integration test suite for it, which is (sadly) not
yet packaged and located in a separate git repository
\&#96;https://somewhere/sometests.git\&#96;. Test suite has a dependency on some
packaged tool \&#96;sometool\&#96;.  And in test repository there is a
\&#96;run_some_tests\&#96; script which triggers test execution.

There goal is to trigger the execution of the test suite for a package.

=== Solution ===

We need to create a \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; configuration file with the following
content:

.rpms/somepackage.git:tests/tests.yml
[source,yaml]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic                        \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;

run: 'run_some_tests --all'                \&#35; \&lt;7\&gt;
----
\&lt;1\&gt; same basic test role as usual
\&lt;2\&gt; additional package which needs to be installed in the test environment
\&lt;3\&gt; path to remote git repository
\&lt;4\&gt; local path where the repository will be checked out
\&lt;5\&gt; any string, will be used as identifier for artifacts and test results
\&lt;6\&gt; same folder as in \&#96;\&lt;4\&gt;\&#96;, contains the checked out external repository
\&lt;7\&gt; test execution command

== Questions ==

=== What if I want to run not one but a sequence of commands? ===

Put a bash script in \&#42;\&#42;tests/scripts/\&#42;\&#42; folder and run it from the
playbook.

.rpms/somepackage.git:
----
.
├── 0001-something.patch
├── somepackage.spec
├── sources
└── tests
├── scripts
│   └── run_tests.sh      \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;
└── tests.yml
----
\&lt;1\&gt; your custom test scenario

Configure dist-git test to run this script:
[source,yaml]
\&#8230;.
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic      \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;
tags:
- classic
tests:
- simple:
dir: scripts               \&#35; \&lt;2\&gt;
run: ./run_tests.sh        \&#35; \&lt;3\&gt;
\&#8230;.
\&lt;1\&gt; same standard role
\&lt;2\&gt; switch to subfolder (path is relative to \&#96;tests/\&#96; folder)
\&lt;3\&gt; this is the test script, its exit code is the outcome of the test

=== What is under the hood? ===

To test the build we:

\&#42; checkout dist-git repo
\&#42; take latest qcow image of Fedora Rawhide
\&#42; install all packages from the koji build on it
\&#42; run ansible playbook defined in tests.yml

=== How do I verify my configuration? ===

It is possible to run and debug standard test roles locally. But we
highly recommend to use the pull-request workflow for it: simply create
a pull-request and wait for CI to react on it.

We trigger almost the same CI machinery for PR testing as it is used for
gating of new builds.

And as soon as result of the test is ready, it will appear on the pull
request page in http://src.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Pagure]

To restart the test add a comment to PR in Pagure, with the following
content: \&#96;[citest]\&#96;



= Quick Start Guide =

Are you eager to try out how the Fedora CI tests work?
Do you want to get a quick hands-on experience without having to read too much documentation?
This quick introduction for the impatient will show you a minimal set of steps to execute existing tests as well as provide useful links to resources where you can learn more.

== First Steps ==

Install the following essential packages on your system (consider using a virtual machine for safe experimenting):

sudo dnf install fedpkg standard-test-roles

Use \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; to clone the package git repository.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Package_Maintenance_Guide/[Package Maintenance Guide] for more info about the tool.

fedpkg clone -a bash
git checkout -b f33 remotes/origin/f33

Tests are defined according to the xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[Standard Test Interface] in the \&#96;tests\&#96; directory:

cd bash/tests/

Test coverage to be executed together with the basic set of metadata is described in the https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[tests.yml] playbook.
Use \&#96;ansible-playbook\&#96; to run all available tests for the classic environment on the local host (needs to be run as root):

ansible-playbook --tags=classic tests.yml

From the ansible output you can directly see an overall summary of the testing.
If you see \&#96;failed=0\&#96; at the end of the log then all tests passed:

localhost: ok=29 changed=11 unreachable=0 failed=0

For more detailed test results check the \&#96;test.log\&#96; and other files in the \&#96;artifacts\&#96; directory:

vim artifacts/test.log

That's it! You just executed test coverage for the Bash package :)

== Test Subjects ==

To execute tests against different test subjects we need to prepare the environment.
Let's store the detailed test results in \&#96;/tmp/artifacts\&#96;, use dynamic inventory as defined by the xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] and download the latest Atomic Host image.

export TEST_ARTIFACTS=/tmp/artifacts
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/usr/share/ansible/inventory
curl -Lo /tmp/atomic.qcow2 https://getfedora.org/atomic_qcow2_latest

Now let's try to run tests against all supported test subjects.

=== Classic ===

Run tests against classic rpms installed on the system:

export TEST_SUBJECTS=''
ansible-playbook --tags=classic tests.yml

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_classic[Classic] for detailed docs.

=== Container ===

For testing containers there is an additional dependency needed:

sudo dnf install standard-test-roles-inventory-docker

Run tests in a docker container:

export TEST_SUBJECTS=docker:docker.io/library/fedora:latest
ansible-playbook --tags=container tests.yml

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_container[Container] for detailed docs.

=== Atomic ===

Run tests against the Atomic Host:

export TEST_SUBJECTS=/tmp/atomic.qcow2
ansible-playbook --tags=atomic tests.yml

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_atomic[Atomic] for detailed docs.

== Hints ==

=== Debug ===

Would you like to investigate why a test failed? Enable debugging to easilly connect to running Atomic or Container to investigate:

export TEST_DEBUG=1
ansible-playbook --tags=atomic tests.yml

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_debug[Debug] for details about debugging.

=== Ignore ===

Use \&#96;.gitignore\&#96; to specify files that Git should ignore.
Such files are created during tests run.
Create a \&#96;tests/.gitignore\&#96; file with the following contents:

[source,gitignore]
----
\&#35; Ignore tests runs/artefacts.
artifacts/\&#42;\&#42;
\&#42;\&#42;/\&#42;.retry
----

== Contribute ==

Are you interested in contributing a new test coverage?
You are most welcome!
As you have seen xref:tests.adoc\&#35;_executing[Executing] a test is quite easy.
xref:tests.adoc\&#35;_writing[Writing] a new test or xref:tests.adoc\&#35;_wrapping[Wrapping] an existing one is quite simple as well.
Here's a few recommendations for creating a new pull request.

=== Fork ===

Unless you are maintainer of the package, who has direct commit access, create a fork of the package git repository using the Fork button in https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash[Pagure] web interface and add your private fork as a new remote.
Create a branch for your new tests.
For example:

git remote add fork ssh://psss@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/psss/rpms/bash.git
git checkout -b tests

If you are not a Fedora packager, use \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; command to clone you fork and set up the git repo config so that you are able to push to it.
See xref:pull-requests.adoc[Pull Requests] for more detailed info.

fedpkg clone -a forks/psss/rpms/bash
git checkout -b tests

=== Add ===

Create new test coverage under the \&#96;tests\&#96; directory, update the \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file accorgingly or create a new one.
Run tests and verify they are stable and working fine in all supported environments.
Add files to git, commit and push:

git add tests.yml test1 test2 test3
git commit -m 'Add CI tests using the Standard Test Interface'
git push fork tests:tests

It is a good idea to include more details and links in the commit message to make the pull request easier for review:

[source,message]
----
Enable CI tests using the Standard Test Interface

Adding initial set of basic functionality tests for bash
according to the Standard Test Interface [1]. See Quick Start
Guide [2] for brief introduction about how to run these tests
and the Fedora CI portal [3] for more detailed info and links.

[1] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/standard-test-interface
[2] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci/quick-start-guide
[3] https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/ci
----

Create a new pull request from your \&#96;tests\&#96; branch against the rawhide branch in the https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/psss/rpms/bash[Pagure] web interface.
You might want to include an additional info about the tests such as:

[source,message]
----
There are three tests available: smoke and func have been tested
across all environments (classic, container, atomic), login is
relevant for classic only (because of a missing dependency).
Please, merge the tests into all currently supported branches.
----

=== Results ===

Once the pull request is created CI Pipeline will detect it and execute tests.
Once the test execution is finished you will see results of the testing on the pull request page.
See the xref:pipeline.adoc[Pipeline] page for the list of active pipelines and result examples.

=== Gating ===

Currently gating the package on test results is an opt-in feature.
In order to enable gating for you component create a \&#96;gating.yaml\&#96; file in the root of your component dist git repository.
See xref:gating.adoc[Gating] for more details.

== Enabling ==

Tests may be written in different ways, but are exposed and invoked in a standard way as defined by the xref:standard-test-interface.adoc[Standard Test Interface] directly in the package https://src.fedoraproject.org/projects/rpms/%2A[git repository].
It is also possible to enable pipeline for the tests namespace, see xref:share-test-code.adoc\&#35;_testing_tests[Testing Tests] for details.
To start working on tests you can clone a package repo directly:

git clone https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qrencode.git

You can also use the \&#96;fedpkg\&#96; to clone the repo.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Package_Maintenance_Guide/[Package Maintenance Guide] for more info about the tool:

fedpkg clone -a qrencode

Tests are enabled by including the \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file under the \&#96;tests\&#96; directory:

cd qrencode/tests
cat tests.yml

Tests are wrapped or written as http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html[Ansible playbooks].
Here is an example of a simple playbok which enables a single \&#96;smoke\&#96; test of the \&#96;qrencode\&#96; package:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
- container
- atomic
tests:
- smoke
required_packages:
- qrencode
- file
----

Let's now briefly look at the playbook to see which variables are defined in order to enable the smoke test:

role:: this test uses role \&#96;standard-test-beakerlib\&#96; from xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] to run a BeakerLib test
tags:: all three test subjects (xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_classic[classic] rpm, docker xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_container[container] and xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_atomic[atomic] host) are relevant for this test
tests:: list of tests to be executed (here we have just a single smoke test)
required_packages:: list of rpm packages required for test execution

It is possible to separate tests into multiple playbooks, each of them can represent a test or a part of a test.
Testing system will run each playbook matching the glob \&#96;tests/tests\&#42;.yml\&#96; separately in a clean environment.
Optionally you can have multiple playbooks without the \&#96;tests\&#96; prefix and link them from the \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file.
Let's have a look at the https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gzip/blob/rawhide/f/tests[gzip] example:

\&gt; fedpkg clone -a gzip
Cloning into 'gzip'\&#8230;

\&gt; cd gzip/tests/
\&gt; ls
test-simple  test_simple.yml  tests.yml

\&gt; cat tests.yml
- include: test_simple.yml

== Executing ==

Before running tests make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

dnf install ansible python2-dnf libselinux-python standard-test-roles

Although some playbooks may function without sudo, tests are always invoked as root.
The test itself may set up users and/or drop permissions if a part of that test.
But in general be sure to be root when invoking tests.

[NOTE]
====
\&#42;Tests may modify or destroy your environment\&#42; +
It's recommended to use a virtual machine for testing to prevent any unwated changes performed by the test to your system.
====

Running a test directly on the current system is easy:

ansible-playbook tests.yml

To only run tests that are suited for classic systems installed by \&#96;yum\&#96; or \&#96;dnf\&#96; use the \&#96;--tags\&#96; argument:

ansible-playbook --tags=classic tests.yml

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] documentation for detailed instructions how to run tests for a specific xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_package[Rpm Package], xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_container[Docker Container] or xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_atomic[Atomic Host].

== Writing ==

Test code itself can be stored directly in the dist-git (recommended as default) or fetched from another repository hosted in the Fedora infrastructure such as the xref:share-test-code.adoc[Test Namespace].
The simplest way to add a new test is by using one of the existing xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] which take care of many implementatin details.
If you want to create a custom test follow instructions below.

Once you've identified a dist-git repository you will be adding new tests to (above), you can start to write a new Ansible test.
Create an http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks.html[Ansible playbook] with a new name.
Make sure the extension is \&#96;.yml\&#96;.
Lets place the following example in \&#96;test_pid_1.yml\&#96; file.

[source,ansible]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
vars:
- artifacts: '{{ lookup('env', 'TEST_ARTIFACTS')|default('./artifacts', true) }}'
tags:
- atomic
- classic
- container
tasks:
- name: Test block
block:
- name: Test that /proc/1 exists
shell: |
ls /proc \&gt; /tmp/test.log || exit 1
grep -qw 1 /tmp/test.log \&amp;\&amp; result=pass || result=fail
echo -e 'results:\n- {result: $result, test: proc}' \&gt; /tmp/results.yml

always:
- name: Pull out the artifacts
fetch:
dest: '{{ artifacts }}/'
src: '{{ item }}'
flat: yes
with_items:
- /tmp/test.log
- /tmp/results.yml
----

All tests have an artifacts directory where they place their output.
The testing or CI system that invokes the test will fill in this variable with a directory that it will archive.
We ensure this directory exists in the test.

By use of \&#96;tags\&#96; we note what kind of systems this test is suitable to run on.
When including additional tasks such as \&#96;pre_tasks\&#96; make sure you set appropriate tag as well.
In addition to tags listed above it's also possible to use \&#96;always\&#96; to denote the task should run for all environments.
For example:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
pre_tasks:
- name: Set up a test user
tags: always
user:
name: test
groups:
- wheel
- adm
----

The \&#96;block\&#96; is the section that runs the actual test.
In this example, we use a rather convoluted way of checking that PID 1 exists.
However, by doing so, we place an extra test artifact in the artifacts directory.

Lastly, we download the artifacts.
Remember that the test is not always running on the same system that it was invoked on.
Try running this example test against an xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_atomic[Atomic Host] or xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_container[Docker Container].
It should pass.
Try changing the \&#96;/proc/1\&#96; argument to another value, and the test should fail.

You can use most of the Ansible techniques in your playbooks.
Take a look at the xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] for Ansible roles to make writing your tests easier.

\&#42;Marking the test to be run\&#42;

Just having a \&#96;.yml\&#96; file in the right directory doesn't yet mean it will be invoked.
Make sure to reference or add it from a \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; playbook.
This is the entry point that the testing or CI system will use to invoke all the tests for a given package.

If the \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file doesn't yet exist, create it.
Lets continue with our above example and create a \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; with the following content:

[source,ansible]
----
- import_playbook: test_pid_1.yml
----

You can now run this test with the standard commands above.

See the xref:quick-start-guide.adoc\&#35;_contributing[Quick Start Guide] to get recommendations for contributing new tests.

== Wrapping ==

Let's say you have a script that runs a test.
Its stdout and stderr is the test output, and an exit status of zero indicates success.
Here's how we would wrap that test to be invoked.
Lets say we have a simple script like in a file called \&#96;test-simple\&#96;

\&#35;!/bin/sh
set -ex
\&#35; exercise installed gzip/gunzip programs
echo 'Bla' \&gt; bla.file
cp bla.file bla.file.orig
gzip bla.file
gunzip bla.file.gz
cmp bla.file bla.file.orig
rm bla.file bla.file.orig

We can write an Ansible wrapper for this script like this in \&#96;test_simple.yml\&#96;:

[source,ansible]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
vars:
- artifacts: '{{ lookup('env', 'TEST_ARTIFACTS')|default('./artifacts', true) }}'
tags:
- atomic
- classic
- container
remote_user: root
tasks:
- name: Install the test files
copy: src={{ item.file }} dest=/usr/local/bin/{{ item.dest }} mode=0755
with_items:
- {file: test-simple, dest: test-simple }

- name: Test block
block:
- name: Execute the tests
shell: |
/usr/local/bin/test-simple \&amp;\&gt; /tmp/test.log \&amp;\&amp; result=pass || result=fail
echo -e 'results:\n- {result: $result, test: simple}' \&gt; /tmp/results.yml

always:
- name: Pull out the logs
fetch:
dest: '{{ artifacts }}/'
src: '{{ item }}'
flat: yes
with_items:
- /tmp/test.log
- /tmp/results.yml
----

All tests have an artifacts directory where they place their output.
The testing or CI system that invokes the test will fill in this variable with a directory that it will archive.
We create ensure this directory exists in the test.

The \&#96;block\&#96; is the section that runs the actual test.

Lastly, we download the artifacts.
Remember that the test is not always running on the same system that it was invoked on.


If the \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; file doesn't yet exist, create it.
Lets continue with our above example and create a \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; with the following content:

[source,ansible]
----
- import_playbook: test_simple.yml
----

Try running this example test against an xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_atomic[Atomic Host] or xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_container[Docker Container].
It should pass.

See xref:standard-test-roles.adoc[Standard Test Roles] documentation for instructions how to wrap a xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_beakerlib[BeakerLib] and xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_rhts[RHTS] tests.

See the xref:quick-start-guide.adoc\&#35;_contributing[Quick Start Guide] to get recommendations for contributing new tests.

== Preparation ==

If you need to do any adjustments to the system before testing, include an extra ansible task before the testing section.
For example this will upgrade all packages on the system to the latest version:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
tags:
- classic
tasks:
- dnf:
name: '\&#42;'
state: latest

- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
tests:
- smoke38:
dir: smoke
run: VERSION=3.8 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
----



= Examples =

On this page you can find some inspiration from real-life examples of tests already enabled in the Fedora CI.

== did ==

For each component it makes sense to enable even the most simple test such as running the binary with \&#96;--help\&#96; or using an internal smoke test.
Here's an example from the https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/did/pull-request/5[did] component:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-basic
tags:
- classic
tests:
- smoke:
dir: .
run: did this year --test
required_packages:
- did
----

That's it.
As you see above, executing a single command as a test is very easy with the help of the xref:standard-test-roles.adoc\&#35;_basic[Basic] role.

== Python ==

There are multiple versions of Python programming language available in Fedora and a number of related subpackages.
As all of them should be tested (including their various combinatios) we xref:share-test-code.adoc[share] test coverage for them in the \&#96;tests\&#96; namespace:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/python[Python tests]

The test repo contains basic smoke test for virtualenv together with example test https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/metadata[Metadata] stored in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flexible_Metadata_Format[Flexible Metadata Format]:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/python/blob/main/f/main.fmf[main.fmf]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/python/blob/main/f/smoke/venv.fmf[venv.fmf]

Once the test is avaible in the share test repository it can be easily linked from supported Python versions:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python2.7/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python2.7]

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.6/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.6],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.7/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.7],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.8/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.8],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.9/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.9],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.10/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.10],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.11/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python3.11]

We test additional Python implementations as well:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pypy/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[pypy],
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pypy3.7/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[pypy3.7]

Plus we ensure that essential tools for venv and virtualnv, such as \&#96;setuptools\&#96;, \&#96;pip\&#96; or \&#96;virtualenv\&#96; itself correctly work with all supported versions:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pip/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python-pip]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-wheel/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python-wheel]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-setuptools/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python-setuptools]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-virtualenv/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python-virtualenv]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-tox/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[python-tox]

Note that for the last set of examples we run the same test several times with modified environment.
For example:

[source,ansible]
----
- smoke36:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=3.6 ./venv.sh
- smoke37:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=3.7 ./venv.sh
- smoke26:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=2.6 METHOD=virtualenv TOX=false ./venv.sh
- smoke27:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=2.7 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
- smoke34_virtualenv:
dir: python/smoke
run: VERSION=3.4 METHOD=virtualenv ./venv.sh
----

In this way we create several virtual test cases from a single test code which prevents duplication and minimizes future maintenance.

== Shell ==

There are several shells which implement the POSIX specification: bash, ksh, mksh, zsh, dash.
All of them share a significant amount of test coverage and it does not make sense to commit \&amp; maintain identical tests in five different repositories (+ possible branches).
Thus we store test code in the \&#96;tests\&#96; namespace:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell[Shell tests]

These tests are then linked from all relevant \&#96;tests.yml\&#96; files:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bash/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[bash]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ksh/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[ksh]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mksh/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[mksh]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zsh/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[zsh]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dash/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[dash]

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flexible_Metadata_Format[Flexible Metadata Format] filter is used to select appropriate tests instead of listing individual tests manually.
Environment variables \&#96;PACKAGES\&#96; and \&#96;SH_BIN\&#96; are used to specify which shell implementation is being tested:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
fmf_filter: 'tier: 1, 2 \&amp; tags: classic'
environment:
PACKAGES: ksh
SH_BIN: ksh
required_packages:
- ksh
- expect            \&#35; login requires expect
- which             \&#35; smoke requires which
----

Some of the tests might be relevant only for selected components.
This can be handled easily by additional \&#96;component\&#96; condition:

[source,ansible]
----
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/shell.git'
dest: 'shell'
fmf_filter: 'tier: 1, 2 \&amp; component: dash'
----

See the https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/metadata[Metadata] page for the full list of so far drafted attributes.

== SELinux ==

There are several components related to SELinux.
They are tightly connected so change in one of them can cause problems in other.
That's why their tests are shared and executed together:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux[SELinux]

Instead of listing relevant tests to be executed manually in each dist git rpms repository https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flexible_Metadata_Format[Flexible Metadata Format] is used:

[source,ansible]
----
- hosts: localhost
roles:
- role: standard-test-beakerlib
tags:
- classic
repositories:
- repo: 'https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux.git'
dest: 'selinux'
fmf_filter: 'tier: 1 | component: selinux-policy'
----

Provided \&#96;fmf_filter\&#96; selects all tests relevant for the \&#96;selinux-policy\&#96; component plus all Tier 1 selinux tests:

tier: 1 | component: selinux-policy

The following six components are covered:

\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/checkpolicy/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[checkpolicy]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libselinux/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libselinux]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libsemanage/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libsemanage]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libsepol/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[libsepol]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/policycoreutils/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[policycoreutils]
\&#42; https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/selinux-policy/blob/rawhide/f/tests/tests.yml[selinux-policy]

Use the \&#96;fmf\&#96; command line tool to quickly check which tests will be scheduled:

\&#35; dnf install -y fmf
\&#35; fedpkg clone -a tests/selinux
\&#35; cd selinux
\&#35; fmf ls --filter 'tier: 1 | component: checkpolicy'
/selinux-policy/policy-rpm-macros
/checkpolicy/sedispol
/checkpolicy/checkmodule
/checkpolicy/sedismod
/checkpolicy/checkpolicy
/checkpolicy/checkpolicy-docs
/libsepol/sepol_check_context
/libsemanage/verify-options-in-semanage-conf
/libselinux/getsebool
/policycoreutils/booleans

See the Flexible Metadata Format documentation for other options how to https://fmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html\&#35;install[install] fmf.




\&#42; Infrastructure

= Jenkins =

The Fedora CI team relies heavily on Jenkins automation for testing builds in Fedora.

== Setup ==

Our Jenkins instances are configured with https://plugins.jenkins.io/openid/[OpenID] to allow admins in the https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/fedora-ci-admins[fedora-ci-admins] group admin access.

To configure this, you simply need to:

\&#42; install the https://plugins.jenkins.io/openid/[OpenID] plugin
\&#42; As an admin, go to Jenkins -\&gt; Configure Global Security
\&#42; Under Access Control, change Security Realm to 'OpenID SSO'
\&#42;\&#42; Set Provider URL to: \&#96;https://id.fedoraproject.org/\&#96;
\&#42; Under Authorization, set to 'Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy'
\&#42;\&#42; Add \&#96;fedora-ci-admins\&#96; and check the 'Administer' box in the Overall column
\&#42; Once you save/apply this config, you may need to logout/login to re-apply your permissions
\&#42;\&#42; NOTE: OpenID does pulls from groups in Jenkins without any custom prefixes required

== Notes ==

The Fedora CI team has recently created an organiation in github here: https://github.com/fedora-ci[Fedora CI github]

The goal is to move all of our repos under this org in the near future.

== RabbitMQ and pipelines ==

\&#42;The same pipeline cannot be used twice by two different pipelines.\&#42;

Each Jenkins job that uses one of osci rabbitmq queue must have entry in the table bellow.

= dist-git pipeline - rebuild container images =

== When rebuild the image ==

There are cases where it is necessary to rebuild the container image used by the pipeline.
For example if some package needs to be updated, like for example:

\&#42; rpm-build
\&#42; standard-test-roles

== How to ==

. Open https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/view/Fedora%20All%20Packages%20Pipeline/job/fedora-stage-container-image-build/[fedora-stage-container-image-build] (make sure you are logged in)
. Click on build with parameters (the image name by default is already fedoraci-runner)
. Once the build start it will create a new container build and tag it as candidate
. Once the image is built a build on https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/view/Fedora%20All%20Packages%20Pipeline/job/fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline/[fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline] is created to validate the image
. If the jenkins build succeeds the image will be tagged as stable and the pipeline will from now on use it

== Troubleshooting ==

. If the job fails the initial point to search for the cause is to look at the build on https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/view/Fedora%20All%20Packages%20Pipeline/job/fedora-stage-container-image-build/[fedora-stage-container-image-build] job.
. If it failed before running https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/view/Fedora%20All%20Packages%20Pipeline/job/fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline/['fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline'] stage it is likely a problem creating the container image checking it on https://console.apps.ci.centos.org:8443/console/project/continuous-infra/browse/builds/fedoraci-runner?tab=history[openshift] could help.
. If the problem was during https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/view/Fedora%20All%20Packages%20Pipeline/job/fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline/['fedora-rawhide-stage-pr-pipeline'] then is necessary to check its build log.

= Onboarding of a CI System =

== Testing in Fedora ==

It's relatively easy to start testing Fedora artifacts (Koji builds, Bodhi updates, etc.) and to contribute test results back so that they can be later used for gating -- i.e. deciding whether the tested artifact should be promoted or not.

Here we describe necessary steps to add a new CI system.


== What is a (suitable) CI System? ==

In order to provide a good workflow and user experience, here are some aspects of CI systems that have proven to be successful:

\&#42; Tests are reliable (low false negative and false positive rates) and cover important stories
\&#42; Tests can be contributed to (open source model) and are ideally similar to other tests, e.g. by using established frameworks / languages
\&#42; Results / notifications are easy to understand and help identify errors quickly
\&#42; Tests are reproducible, if necessary artifacts from test runs are stored for users to consume, such as virtual machine images

In short, test results should be directly actionable! As a developer, I need to quickly decide whether the test is broken or the code, and then fix the issue.

== Testing and Gating Builds ==

=== Gating Workflow ===

On the highest level, the gating workflow consists of the following steps:

\&#42; Submit a build of a package (Koji)
\&#42; Trigger CI systems to run tests  (Fedora CI, Your CI, etc.)
\&#42; Collect results from the CI systems (ResultsDB)
\&#42; Make a decision (Greenwave)
\&#42; If the decision is 'pass', then let the build pass the gate to the main repository (Bodhi)

=== Gating Messages ===

Gating process is implemented as a set of services which interact with each other via message bus (FedoraMessaging).

Therefore to add a piece (for example a CI system) to the process, you essentially need to start receiving and sending messages via FedoraMessaging.

TIP: Find out more about https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/rawhide-gating/[gating in Fedora Rawhide] -- especially about the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/rawhide-gating/single-builds/\&#35;_how_does_gating_single_build_updates_work[single] and https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/rawhide-gating/multi-builds/[multi-build] updates.


== How to add a CI System ==

CI systems in Fedora are autonomous entities that typically need to handle following things:

\&#42; triggering when certain events occur
\&#42; actual testing
\&#42; publishing test results


=== Triggering and Testing ===

Services in Fedora publish messages when various events occur and thus CI systems can trigger testing when for example new Bodhi update is created.

When Bodhi update is created, a new 'koji-build-group.build.complete' message is published on the https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/raw?topic=org.fedoraproject.prod.bodhi.update.status.testing.koji-build-group.build.complete[org.fedoraproject.prod.bodhi.update.status.testing.koji-build-group.build.complete] topic.

The schema of these 'koji-build-group.build.complete' messages is defined in the https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/messages[CI Messages specification].

If your CI system is Jenkins, then you can use the https://plugins.jenkins.io/jms-messaging/[jms-messaging plugin] to trigger your tests when defined events occur. Getting the trigger syntax right in Jenkins pipelines can be tricky, but you can take a look at the existing example https://github.com/fedora-ci/rpmdeplint-trigger/blob/b078ae3f7134dbc5a155aa435362cd3a241ab99a/Jenkinsfile\&#35;L13-L29[here].

It's of course possible to trigger testing on other types of events, not just the Bodhi updates. You can find more Fedora message topics in the older https://fedmsg2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics.html[fedmsg2 documentation]. Beware though, the list is incomplete.


=== Sharing Test Results ===

CI systems should publish standardized CI messages so the progress of the testing can be observed and the results can be acted upon by other services in the Fedora infrastructure.
Although publishing test results is not mandatory, CI systems which don't publish the standardized CI messages cannot be part of the gating process.

There are four types of messages that CI systems should be sending:

\&#42; test.queued - when there is an artifact (a Bodhi update for example) in a queue waiting to be tested
\&#42; test.running - when testing is in progress
\&#42; test.complete - when testing is finished
\&#42; test.error - when testing couldn't start or couldn't finish due to an outside circumstances (typically an infrastructure error)

These messages have well-defined schemas. The schemas are part of https://pagure.io/fedora-ci/messages[the CI Messages specification].


For convenience, here are links to schemas for simple koji-build artifacts and koji-build-group artifacts:

==== Test Identifiers ====

When you send a 'koji-build.test.complete' message to the message bus, the test result gets stored in the ResultsDB. Later on you can refer to the stored test result in a Greenwave policy: 'if test XYZ passed, let the build through the gate'.

Therefore you need unique identifiers for test results.

Test identifiers are built from three parts: test namespace, test category and test type.

In the 'koji-build.test.complete' schema, these variables are represented by namespace, category and type fields respectively.

Namespace is always an ID of your CI system with the name of the artifact type, so for example: fedora-ci.koji-build, or osci.pull-request.

Category you can choose from a predefined list:

\&#42; static-analysis
\&#42; functional
\&#42; integration
\&#42; validation

Type is an arbitrary string, which you can define based on the specifics of your CI system.

It is your responsibility as an owner of the CI system to maintain consistent naming of tests under your namespace.

The final test identifier may look like this: fedora-ci.koji-build.tier0.functional

= Test Case Relevancy =

== Motivation ==

Sometimes a test case is only relevant for specific environment.
Test Case Relevancy allows to filter irrelevant test cases out.

== Implementation ==

Test case relevancy is function which takes environment parameters and returns \&#96;True\&#96;, \&#96;False\&#96; or a list of environment variables.

=== Syntax ===

Test case relevancy is defined by one or more \&#96;condition: decision\&#96; rules.

Allowed operators are: \&#96;+= == != \&lt; \&lt;= \&gt; \&gt;= \&amp;\&amp;+\&#96;.
Anything beyond a \&#96;\&#35;\&#96; sign is considered to be a comment and will be ignored.

Everything is case insensitive.
First matching rule wins (terminates immediately the relevancy evaluation, the rest of the rules will be ignored).

=== Defaults ===

If there is no rule specified, test case relevancy defaults to \&#96;True\&#96;, that is test case is relevant and should be executed.

=== Environment ===

Acceptable parameters defining the environment are:

product:: product name (rhel rhel-5 rhel-5.6 rhdts rhscl)
distro:: distribution (rhel-6 rhel-6.3 rhscl-1.0.0 f-28)
variant:: distro variant (Client Desktop Server Workstation)
arch:: architecture (i386 ppc64 s390x x86_64)
collection:: software collection (python27 python33 perl516\&#8230;)
component:: component to be tested (php, apache, \&#8230;)

While \&#96;distro\&#96; is always used to define the operating system the software is supposed to run on, \&#96;product\&#96; is used to describe the target product subscribed and consumed by the customer (can be a layered product on top of RHEL such as RHSCL, or RHEL itself if the component is included directly in the operating system).

Distro comparison operates in two modes:

Major mode:: When comparing against a major version such as \&#96;distro \&lt; rhel-6\&#96; other major versions are considered (matches any of \&#96;rhel-3 rhel-4 rhel-5\&#96;).
Minor mode:: If minor version is provided as well, for example \&#96;distro \&lt; rhel-6.3\&#96;, comparison is performed only within the given major (matches \&#96;rhel-6.0 rhel-6.1 rhel-6.2\&#96;).

Rules which contain environment parameters which are not known at the time of evaluation will be skipped.

=== Decision ===

The \&#96;decision\&#96; part of the rule can contain following values:

True:: test case is relevant for given environment
False:: test case is not relevant for this environment
A=X B=Y C=Z:: test case is relevant for the modified environment

The last option above allows to adjust the environment in which the test case is to be executed by providing the list of environment variables which will be passed to the test.

The decision value may be omitted.
In such case \&#96;True\&#96; is used by default.
So these two lines define identical relevancy:

distro \&gt; rhel-7: True
distro \&gt; rhel-7

== Examples ==

mod_wsgi relevant for RHEL6 and newer:

distro \&lt; rhel-6: False

busybox not available for s390x on RHEL6:

arch = s390x \&amp;\&amp; distro = rhel-6: False

perl-Config-General not present in the \&#96;Client\&#96; variant:

variant = Client: False

Run python unit tests under valgrind on suitable archs only:

arch = ia64: PHASES=novalgrind
arch = s390x \&amp;\&amp; distro \&lt; rhel-6: PHASES=novalgrind

New component python-ctypes added in rhel-5.8:

distro \&lt; rhel-5:   False
distro \&lt; rhel-5.8: False

Exim present solely in RHEL5:

distro != rhel-5: False



= Source Git =

\&#96;source-git\&#96; is current code-name for work which covers multiple areas:
packaging automation and improvements, rawhide stabilization, and getting upstream projects closer to Fedora.
In our world, source git is a repository with upstream sources and Fedora build recipes (spec files, downstream patches as additional commits).
The repository contains git branches which track respective Fedora versions.
Ideally, source git equals the upstream repository.

== Mission Statement ==

We are aiming for four things:

. Bring upstream projects closer to Fedora.
. Improve stability of Fedora rawhide.
. Improve day-to-day tasks of packagers.
. Automate pulling of new upstream releases into Fedora.

Interested? Please, read on!

== What and Why? ==

\&#42; Our intent is to bring downstream and upstream communities closer: Provide feedback from downstream to upstream
(e.g. _'Hello \\&lt;upstream project Y\&gt;, your newest release doesn't work in Fedora rawhide, it breaks \\&lt;Z\&gt;, here is a link to logs.'_).
All of this can be automated.

\&#42; One of the implications is that it's trivial to propose changes back to upstream or cherry-pick fixes from upstream to downstream.

\&#42; Fedora rawhide stability is on the menu now:
only merge, build and compose components which integrate well with the rest of the operating system.
No more broken composes or updates which break rest of the operating system.

\&#42; Developing in dist-git is cumbersome.
Editing patch files and moving tarballs around is not fun.
Why not working with the source code itself?
With source git, you'll have an upstream repository and the dist-git content stuffed in a dedicated directory.

\&#42; Let's use modern development techniques such as pull requests, code review, modern git forges, automation and continuous integration.
We have computers to do all the mundane tasks.
Why we, as humans, should do such work?

\&#42; We want dist-git to be 'a database of content in a release' rather a place to do actual work.
On the other hand, you'll still be able to interact with dist-git the same way.
We are not taking that away.
Source git is meant to be the modern, better alternative.

\&#42; Automatically pull and validate new upstream releases.
This can be a trivial thing to do, why should maintainers waste their times on work which can be automated.

== Current Status ==

Right now we are aiming for a proof of concept.
Once it's done, we'll create a demo and present it at https://devconf.cz[DevConf.cz].

We understand this page is pretty concise.
Once we have more information to share (especially when the PoC is done), we'll update this wiki page.
In the meantime, please check out the https://github.com/packit-service/packit[github repo] for an up-to-date information.




= Frequently Asked Questions =

[qanda]
Should I test my package?::
Of course you should!

How do I get help?::
Use the
https://matrix.to/\&#35;/\&#35;fedora-ci:fedoraproject.org[\&#35;fedora-ci channel]
on Matrix.

Why not rely on %check?::
\&#96;%check\&#96; and the tests run in the CI pipeline are complementary.
\&#96;%check\&#96; allows to perform a number of checks at build time but will not detect missing requirement, missing configuration file and this kind of situation which the CI pipeline will be able to test and find.
We could see this as \&#96;%check\&#96; being unit-test (where the unit is the package) versus integration tests where the tests are run in the entire distribution just as we distribute it to our users.
So the CI pipeline will be able to find integration bugs that the \&#96;%check\&#96; section will never be able to.

Where do I put my tests?::
There are several options where to store the test code.
Here are some of the most important advantages and disadvantages of each approach:
Test code in \&#42;dist git rpms namespace\&#42; is branched together with spec files and thus can closely mirror functionality.
Tests used across multiple components or OS releases can be stored in the \&#42;dist git test namespace\&#42; to share the test code and minimize maintenance.
Fetching tests from an \&#42;upstream project git\&#42; is also possible and supported by standard-test-roles (source role).
In order to prevent unexpected test failures caused by upstream changes it is sometimes better to reference a specific commit rather then branch.
Tests enabled in \&#42;make check\&#42; are executed in a different environment (buildroot).
This is good for unit tests but not recommended for new Tier 1 test coverage.
Enable 'make check' in tests.yml only if testing installed rpm.
