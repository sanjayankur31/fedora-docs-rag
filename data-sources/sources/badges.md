## Start on a task {#start-task}

There are three ways to contribute to Fedora Badges:

&#42; As a designer &#42; As a developer &#42; As a system administrator

Before you begin any of the following tasks, [introduce
yourself](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/introduce-yourself/)!

### As a designer {#_as_a_designer}

The Fedora Badges community accepts requests for new badges in a public
issue tracker on [Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues). The
community opens an issue there when they have a new idea for a badge. To
get started with badge design, follow these steps:

1.  Review [How to design a Fedora Badge](:design-badges.xml)
    documentation

2.  Set up Inkscape with Badges color palettes, fonts, and templates
    (provided in documentation)

3.  Review Badge tickets tagged as [AW:
    needed](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=AW%3A+needed&amp;close_status=)

4.  If nobody is assigned to the issue, leave a comment that you want to
    work on the Badge artwork

5.  A Badges contributor will reply to confirm the Badge is possible and
    ready to be worked on (we don't want you to make a design for a
    Badge that isn't technically possible!)

6.  Begin designing the badge, post SVGs/PNGs of your artwork to the
    issue for review

### As a developer {#_as_a_developer}

*This section is being worked on. The information is not yet complete.*

Fedora Badges is made up of different components divided into frontend
and backend. As a starter there's a helpful
[document](https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/arc/blob/main/f/docs/badges/index.md)
provided by the Infrastrucre Team.

Development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/fedora-infra/).
Issues are primarily tracked on
[Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) and distributed from there.

### As a system administrator {#_as_a_system_administrator}

*This section is being worked on. The information is not yet complete.*

The [Fedor Badges Team](https://pagure.io/group/fedora-badges) takes
care of keeping things running, attending to issues and bugs filed on
[Pagure](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) and keeping the documentation,
what you are reading now, up to date.

If anything is not working as expected please open an
[issue](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/new_issue) or, if you already
have a fix, submit a PR.

Alternatively, have a look at issues tagged [good first
issue](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=good+first+issue&amp;close_status=).
If you want to work on one of these, leave a comment, so someone from
the team can assign it to you. Help is always welcome.

# How to design a Fedora Badge {#_how_to_design_a_fedora_badge}

This page explains how to design and create new Fedora Badges. This
guide walks through the following:

&#42; Review guidelines for creating a Badge &#42; Set up Inkscape for
Fedora Badges &#42; Get badge template files

## Review Badges style guide {#style-guide}

Refer to the Fedora Badges style guide for how Badges are designed. The
style guide provides explanations and suggestions for shapes, colors,
and other requirements to design good badges. Refer to this often while
designing new badges. Following this guide makes new badge submissions
easier to review and less time reworking a badge from feedback.

[Fedora Badges Style
Guide]({attachmentsdir}/fedora-badges-style-guide.pdf) (*last revised*:
January 2014)

## Set up Inkscape

Inkscape is recommended for designing Fedora Badges. Other Badge
designers use Inkscape. Providing help and support is easier if you use
the same tools.

### Install Inkscape

Using Fedora? Reference the Fedora Magazine's [Getting started with
Inkscape on
Fedora](https://fedoramagazine.org/getting-started-inkscape-fedora/)
article for help. For other operating systems, see Inkscape's [downloads
portal](https://inkscape.org/release/) for help installing it.

### Download and install color palettes {#install-color-palettes}

Common color schemes are recommended for Fedora Badges. The following
palettes provide the recommended colors for Inkscape. With these
palettes, common colors will appear in the color toolbar of Inkscape.
These palettes may work with other design programs, but they are not
officially supported.

&#42; [Basic color
palette]({attachmentsdir}/palettes/badges_fedora_palette.gpl): Required
&#42; [Extended color
palette]({attachmentsdir}/palettes/badges_extended_palette.gpl):
Optional (gives you extra choices to work with)

To install, move the downloaded palette files to
\~/.config/inkscape/palettes To access the newly installed palettes, in
Inkscape, find the palette bar at the bottom of the screen and click
triangle at the right end and select your desired palette.

### Install Comfortaa typeface {#install-typeface}

Badges with text use the Comfortaa typeface. The Comfortaa typeface is
used across the Fedora community. Install the typeface so it is
available in your design program. *Note*: If you use Fedora, the font
may already be installed.

&#42; [Comfortaa typeface]({attachmentsdir}/typeface/comfortaa.zip)

## Download Badge template assets {#badge-template-assets}

Different Fedora Badges templates are available to choose from.
Templates are organized in different categories below.

### Badge shapes

All Fedora Badges have a common shape. Some have different color rings
depending on the type of badge (see [Fedora Badges Style
Guide]({attachmentsdir}/fedora-badges-style-guide.pdf)). Not sure what
template to use? Ask for help in a Fedora Badges ticket and a designer
will help you choose.

&#42; [Community
template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/community-template.svg) &#42;
[Content
template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/content-learning-template.svg)
&#42; [Development
template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/development-template.svg) &#42;
[Events template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/events-template.svg) &#42;
[Miscellaneous
template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/miscellaneous-template.svg) &#42;
[Quality Assurance
template]({attachmentsdir}/templates/quality-template.svg)

### Content templates

Content templates are common patterns or content used across many
badges. The Badges team encourages using these templates where possible.
It helps maintain a consistent theme across the Badges site.

&#42; [Backgrounds template]({attachmentsdir}/content/backgrounds.svg):
Different backgrounds to use for badge designs &#42; [Misc.
graphics]({attachmentsdir}/content/badge_graphics.svg): Random icons and
patterns &#42; [Badger templates]({attachmentsdir}/content/badgers.svg):
Example badgers to reuse &#42; [Panda
templates]({attachmentsdir}/content/pandas.svg): Example pandas to reuse

### Tutorial content

Tutorial content are pre-created, individual designs to help you design
a Fedora Badge. Tutorial content was created for other badges, but can
be reused in future designs. If you want to try out a new design, try
using these to create your ideas!

&#42; [Bicycle]({attachmentsdir}/tutorial-content/bike.svg) (with no
rider) &#42; [Package hatching from
egg]({attachmentsdir}/tutorial-content/hatchling.svg) &#42; [Package
icon]({attachmentsdir}/tutorial-content/package.svg) &#42; [Full-sized
panda]({attachmentsdir}/tutorial-content/panda.svg) (from panda riding
bike)

&#42; [How to push Fedora Badges](:push-badges.xml) &#42; [Fedbadges
repository at Github](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges)

# How to push Fedora Badges {#_how_to_push_fedora_badges}

## Architecture {#_architecture}

The badge-awarding back-end daemon,
[fedbadges](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges), wakes up when it
receives a [fedmsg](https://fedmsg.readthedocs.io) event. It compares
that message and the history in
[datanommer](https://github.com/fedora-infra/datanommer) against a
series of rules. If a contributor matches the criteria described in one
of those rules, then they are awarded a badge.

The front-end is a web application called
[Tahrir](https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir). It mostly is just an
interface for users to look at their badges. However, it also has an
admin interface for manually adding new badges, awarding badges, and
creating \'invitations\' (QR codes) for badges.

The badge-awarding back-end daemon,
[fedbadges](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges), runs in
OpenShift, in the &#96;badges&#96; project. The front-end runs in
OpenShift as well.

### Upstream documentation {#_upstream_documentation}

&#42; For a detailed description of how the fedbadges daemon works, see
the [fedbadges
README](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges/blob/develop/README.rst).
&#42; For a diagram of the interacting pieces in the Fedora Badges
system, see the [fedbadges
diagrams](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges/blob/develop/diagrams/).

## Sysadmin process: How to push a Badge {#_sysadmin_process_how_to_push_a_badge}

Pushing badges consists of two operations:

1.  Push badge assets (&#96;.png&#96;, &#96;.svg&#96;, &#96;.yaml&#96;)
    to [fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) repository

2.  Add badge to
    [badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/)

Anyone with write permissions to
[fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) can push badges. Pull
requests can also be used. Only members of the &#96;sysadmin-badges&#96;
FAS group *and* [admins of the web interface](#add-tahrir-admins) can
add badges.

Badge artists and badge developers should push design assets
(&#96;png&#96; and &#96;svg&#96; art) and rules (&#96;yaml&#96;) to the
[fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) repository.

### Preparing to create a badge {#_preparing_to_create_a_badge}

Once a badge is approved by the Design Team and has the [ready to
push](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=ready+to+push)
tag, they are ready to be pushed. Follow this checklist to push a new
badge:

1.  Ensure artwork is &#42;approved&#42; by Design Team

2.  Ensure name and description of badge are clear

3.  Ensure one of these requirements is met: &#42;&#42; *Manually
    awarded badges*: What FAS accounts receive permissions to award
    badge &#42;&#42; *Awarded via fedmsg rule*: YAML file with rules is
    present

If you are confused or something is missing, comment on the issue and
remove the &#42;ready to push&#42; tag.

### Add badge assets to Pagure {#_add_badge_assets_to_pagure}

1.  Download artwork and rule file (if applicable): &#42;&#42;
    Double-check the artwork is actually the final version from ticket
    &#42;&#42; Open / view both art files to check they are not corrupt
    (in the past, corrupt images were accidentally pushed)

2.  Give both art and rule files the &#42;same name&#42;, place into
    [pngs/](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/blob/master/f/pngs),
    [svg/](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/blob/master/f/svgs),
    [rules/](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/blob/master/f/rules)
    directories

3.  *On request only*: Generate a STL file for 3D-printing a badge:
    &#42;&#42; Change directories into &#96;bin/&#96; and run
    &#96;export.sh&#96;. This creates a STL file for the badge and moves
    it to the correct place. &#42;&#42; Check the &#96;README&#96; file
    in &#96;bin/&#96; for more info about the script.

4.  Commit all files and push to
    [fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) (or make a PR)

Make sure files have a reasonable name (e.g.
&#96;all-lowercase-dashes-only.png&#96;). Some types of badges follow a
naming convention, like FAS group membership badges (i.e.
&#96;fas-badge-name.png&#96;) or Koji build badges (i.e.
&#96;koji-badge-name.png&#96;). Follow past precedent where possible.
Later, the file name is used for the file on the front-end server (e.g.
&#96;<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/pngs/all-lowercase-dashes-only.png&#96>;).

### Let the assets be pulled by the back-end server {#_let_the_assets_be_pulled_by_the_back_end_server}

*Note*: All assets must be in the &#96;master&#96; branch of
[fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) before proceeding.

The badges will be automatically pulled from the Pagure repository every
15 minutes.

Once finished, ensure badge is now publicly visible (i.e.
&#96;<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/pngs/&lt;name&gt;.png&#96>;)

### Add automatically-awarded badges {#_add_automatically_awarded_badges}

*Note*: Pay close attention when following these steps. It is easy to
create a badge, but much harder to edit it later. Double-check
information is entered correctly in the YAML file on first go, or else
you have to write SQL statements to fix it later.

Automatically awarded badges are created by the YAML rule file. Once the
repo has been updated on the server (every 15 minutes), the badge is
created and placed in the [badges
index](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges). The only part
*not* created automatically are tags (see [Badge
metadata](#badge-metadata) below for info about tags). To add new tags,
find the badge on
[badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/). If you
are logged in as an admin, there is a text field to enter in new tags.

### Add manually-awarded badges {#_add_manually_awarded_badges}

*Note*: Pay close attention when following these steps. It is easy to
create a badge, but much harder to edit it later. Double-check
information is entered correctly on first go, or else you have to write
SQL statements to fix it later.

Once the badge assets are pulled by the back-end, add the badge to the
front-end, \[.title-ref\]&#35;Tahrir&#35;. The front-end is hosted at
[badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/). Follow
these steps to add the badge in Tahrir.

1.  Open *Admin* interface on
    [badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/)

2.  Go to the *Add badge* section.

3.  Enter in all information as provided in the badge ticket (see [Badge
    metadata](#badge-metadata) below.)

4.  Double-check all entered information is &#42;correct and
    accurate&#42;

5.  Click *Create badge* to create new badge

The badge is now created. You should be able to find in the [badges
index](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges).

#### Grant authorizations {#_grant_authorizations}

Manually-awarded badges require authorized users to issue a badge. You
can do this at the bottom of the *Admin* interface, near *Create
Authorizations*. Add the person to receive awarding privileges into the
*Person Email* field. &#42;This must be formatted as their
fedoraproject.org email address&#42; (e.g. FASuser \[at\] fedoraproject
\[dot\] org). For badge name, use the slug (or badge name) from the URL
of the badge (e.g. for
[badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/commops-superstar](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/commops-superstar),
this is &#96;commops-superstar&#96;).

To add multiple users, repeat this process for each user.

### Badge metadata

&#42; &#42;Name&#42;: name of the badge -- this determines URL of badge,
so triple-check for typos &#42; &#42;Image&#42;: full link to the PNG
(e.g.
&#96;<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/pngs/all-lowercase-dashes-only.png&#96>;)
&#42; &#42;Description&#42;: badge description text (ensure there is
*no* hanging whitespace) &#42; &#42;Criteria&#42;: link to the issue in
[fedora-badges](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges) &#42; &#42;Issuer&#42;:
keep the default &#42; &#42;Tags&#42;: comma-delimited list of tags:
&#42;&#42; &#42;Review other similar badges to ensure tags are
correct.&#42; Some tags are special and function as categories.
&#42;&#42; &#42;Follow past precedent&#42; for tags. Avoid creating new
tags if at all possible. &#42;&#42; Removing tags *is not* easy. Adding
them later *is* easy.

#### Close out the ticket {#_close_out_the_ticket}

After pushing the badge, do some last checks to make sure the badge
pushed correctly. Make sure the page is viewable and double-check that
it is categorized correctly in the [badges
index](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges).

Return to the Pagure issue for the badge. Post a link to the pushed
badge. If you granted authorizations, list the FAS usernames you granted
authorizations to. After commenting, closing the issue as
&#42;pushed&#42;.

Congratulations, you just pushed your very own Fedora Badge!

## How to manually award a badge {#_how_to_manually_award_a_badge}

To perform this, you must be in the &#96;sysadmin-badges&#96; FAS group.

There is a script installed on &#96;badges-backend01&#96; in
&#96;/usr/local/bin/award-badge&#96;. It has help options that you can
pull up with &#96;award-badge -h&#96;. It takes a required &#96;\--user
FAS_USERNAME&#96; and a required &#96;\--badge BADGE_ID&#96; option. For
example, the following invocation would award the \'Associate Editor\'
badge to \'ralph\':

``` bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/award-badge --user ralph --badge associate-editor
```

The &#96;BADGE_ID&#96; for a badge can be found by visiting its page on
the web UI. That badge can be found at
&#96;<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/associate-editor&#96>;.

The &#96;award-badge&#96; script and source code is managed by
ansible.git. The source code is in
[roles/badges/backend/files/award-badge](https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible/blob/master/f/roles/badges/backend/files/award-badge).

Often enough, there is need for a workflow to batch award a badge to a
number of people. For instance, the *Keepin\' Fedora Beautiful* badge
comes from a member of the Design Team posting a ticket with a list of
FAS usernames (i.e.
[fedora-badges&#35;129](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/129)).

For cases, like that you can &#96;wget&#96; the file with the list of
FAS usernames on &#96;badges-backend01&#96; and run something like:

``` bash
$ for i in $(cat keepingbeautiful-list ) ; do
sudo /usr/local/bin/award-badge --user $i --badge keepin-fedora-beautiful-f20;
done
```

## How to manually revoke a badge or authorization {#manually-revoke-badge}

You may revoke badge or badge authorizations in a similar fashion to the
&#96;award-badges&#96; script. You may chain the invocation of the
&#96;revoke-badge&#96; or &#96;revoke-authorization&#96; script in the
same manner as the &#96;award-badges&#96; script.

```

## How to add admins to Tahrir {#add-tahrir-admins}

It would be nice if we could automatically grant admin access in the web
interface to members of the &#96;sysadmin-badges&#96; FAS group. We
currently do not have this feature and must maintain the list of web UI
admins separately.

The configuration file for the badges front-end web app is managed by
ansible.git. The source code is in
[roles/badges/frontend/templates/tahrir.ini](https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible/blob/master/f/roles/badges/frontend/templates/tahrir.ini).

In that file, find the &#96;tahrir.admin&#96; option. It is a
comma-separated list of email addresses that, when logged in, should be
granted rights to access the admin panels at
[badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/).

To add a new admin, add their &#96;<FAS_USERNAME@fedoraproject.org>&#96;
email to that line, commit, and push. Use Ansible to run the
&#96;openshift-apps/badges.yml&#96; playbook to push the config change
out to the web front-end nodes.

## How to create an invitation and QR code {#_how_to_create_an_invitation_and_qr_code}

This is done through the admin panel of the web interface (although we
can probably write a script for it to be used on the back-end node).

Invitations / QR codes are typically created for Fedora events. For
instance at the Flock 2013 Fedora Contributors conference, we created a
badge to award attendees. We followed the procedure below to generate an
invitation and a QR code. Next, the QR code was distributed to
conference organizers. They added the QR code to the program brochure
that each attendee was given. Then, any attendee that scanned the code
was redirected on their phone to the badges app, where they were awarded
the badge.

### Create an invitation {#_create_an_invitation}

1.  Make sure you are an admin in the web interface and logged into
    [badges.fedoraproject.org](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/)

2.  Click the *Admin* link in the UI

3.  Under the *Invitations* section, add this information: &#42;&#42;
    &#42;Creation Date&#42;: Optional. It defaults to the current date.
    &#42;&#42; &#42;Expiration Date&#42;: Optional, but you probably
    want to specify one. It defaults to 2 hours from the current time.
    For instance, at the Flock 2013 conference, we set the expiration
    date at the end of the conference. Anyone who tried to claim the
    badge with the QR code after that time would be denied, with the
    message *this invitation is expired*. &#42;&#42; &#42;Badge ID&#42;:
    \'ID\' of the badge you want to award. See the [section
    above](#manually-revoke-badge) for how to find a badge ID.
    &#42;&#42; &#42;Person email&#42;: Email of a person in the badges
    database. In our case, use their Fedora email (e.g.
    &#96;<FAS_USERNAME@fedoraproject.org>&#96;).

Now, the user you specified will have a link to the QR code and invite
link on their profile page. They can take initiative to distribute and
share the badge as they wish.

## Useful scripts for manual work {#_useful_scripts_for_manual_work}

See &#96;ansible/roles/badges/backend/files/&#96; for the motherload.
These all get deployed to &#96;/usr/local/bin/&#96; on
&#96;badges-backend01&#96; where you can login to execute them.

&#42;edit-badge&#42;

:   Update the description and the criteria link for a badge. Useful in
    the event you created it incorrectly, or if feedback from other
    stakeholders requires us to change something.

&#42;award-badge&#42;

:   Award a badge to a specific user.

&#42;revoke-badge&#42;

:   Removes a badge from a user to whom it has been awarded erroneously.
    &#42;Remember!&#42; If you revoke a badge award from a user, you
    should also give them the &#96;consolation-prize&#96; badge as a
    token of apology.

&#42;grant-authorization&#42;

:   Grant authorization rights on a badge to a privileged user. They can
    then create invitation links and QR codes for that badge as well as
    award it directly to other users from the web interface.

&#42;revoke-authorization&#42;

:   Revoke those authorization rights for a user on a given badge.
