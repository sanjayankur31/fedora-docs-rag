We are looking into ways of making Fedora a friendlier environment for
ROS2 by:

- Building and maintaining non ROS2 packages within Fedora;

- Creating ROS2 container images for both development and production
  environments;

- Make ROS2 RPMs available in Fedora.

Part of our effort it so also build and build, package and run Autoware
components (Open Ad Kit for now) in Fedora by:

- Make Autoware linux container images available;

- Build and distribute Autoware as RPM packages.
