![NeuroFedora Logo](NeuroFedoraLogo01.png)

Welcome to the NeuroFedora documentation. NeuroFedora is a [Fedora
community special interest group
(SIG)](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/orgchart/) that aims
to make it easy for you to use Fedora Linux based [Free/Open source
software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) platforms for
neuroscience.

We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all
to use, share, modify, and study. The use of Free software also aids
reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research
community. By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to
use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.

The NeuroFedora community makes more than 200 FOSS software tools easily
installable on the Fedora Linux operating system and its derivative
platforms. We also provide a ready to use Fedora Linux based operating
system that comes pre-installed with many tools for computational
neuroscience. Please use the links in the sidebar to learn more about
NeuroFedora and the artefacts we produce.

NeuroFedora in its current form [was started on September 30,
2018](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VXN4UBCNIL6BUCDRN55IGVK3IMO3HF6C/).

# Join us {#_join_us}

We are always looking for more volunteers to help us do more. The
various contributor roles that we currently have set up can be found in
the [contributor documentation](contributing.xml). You can even create a
new role for yourself! Our volunteers generally work a few hours a week
on NeuroFedora.

# Free Software {#_free_software}

You can learn more about the Free Software movement [on their
website](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/).
You can learn more about the use of [Open source for Neuroscience
here](http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/). Other relevant
neuroscience links are collected on a [separate
page](related-links.xml).

# Installation Media {#_installation_media}

The Fedora community produces a number of Fedora Linux based operating
systems for different use-cases, including one for computational
neuroscience.

## Laptops, workstations, and desktop PCs {#_laptops_workstations_and_desktop_pcs}

For laptops and workstations, a number of Fedora Linux variants with
different [desktop
environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) (user
interfaces) are available.

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

The child friendly Fedora Linux platform with the [Sugar on a
stick](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/soas/) learning platform is
also available.

### Other customised Fedora Linux OS platforms {#_other_customised_fedora_linux_os_platforms}

A number of other customised Fedora Linux OS platforms are also
available from <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/>. These include
operatings sytems for [scientific
computing](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific),
[robotics](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/robotics),
[security](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/security), [teaching
Python](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/python-classroom), [music
production](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/jam),
[gaming](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/games), [design and
multimedia](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/design-suite), and
[astronomy](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/astronomy).

### Immutable container based desktop operating systems {#_immutable_container_based_desktop_operating_systems}

A number of Fedora Linux products with immutable operating systems are
also available. In these variants, unlike traditional platforms where
the operating system consists of multiple pieces of software that can
all be modified independently, the operating system is a single unit
where all components are updated together. User applications and
containers are kept separate from the host system. These features are
intended to make the system more stable and reliable.

These platforms are excellent for containerized applications and
container based development workflows.

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

## Servers {#_servers}

A [Fedora Linux for servers platform](https://getfedora.org/en/server/)
is a short-lifecycle, community-supported server operating system that
enables seasoned system administrators, experienced with any OS, to make
use of the very latest technologies available in the open source
community.

## Containers {#_containers}

These Fedora Linux platforms are primarily aimed at container based
development and deployment:

A [Fedora account](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/) is required to
access the [applications](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/) and
[infrastructure](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure) used by
the Fedora community. It only takes a minute to set up! You can learn
more about the Fedora project
[here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/).
::::

NeuroFedora is a community supported initiative, and team members work
on it in their free time. Usually, this is about 5---​10 hours a week on
average, depending on our professional work loads and so on. We are
always looking for more hands to help with NeuroFedora, and we are more
than happy to help people learn the technical skills required to
contribute. Please [get in touch](communicating.xml) if you would like
to join the team!

## Infrastructure overview {#_infrastructure_overview}

NeuroFedora relies completely on the [infrastructure maintained by the
Fedora community](https://apps.fedoraproject.org):

### Community organisation, governance, and dissemination {#_community_organisation_governance_and_dissemination}

&#42; Access to all infrastructure is provided by a [Fedora accounts
system (FAS)](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/) account. &#42; Our
[housekeeping ticket system](https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora)
lives on [Pagure.io](https://pagure.io). &#42; The public discussion
mailing list is hosted on [Mailman, with a Hyperkitty powered web
interface](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/neurofedora@lists.fedoraproject.org/).
&#42; A private (because bugs may include private information) packager
only mailing list for bugzilla notifications is also hosted on
[Mailman](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/neuro-sig@lists.fedoraproject.org/).
&#42; Our Matrix chat channel is hosted on
[Element/Matrix](https://matrix.to/%3C/mark%3E/&#35;neuro:fedoraproject.org).
&#42; The logs from our IRC meetings are maintained at [meetbot
(mote)](https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/). &#42; Meetings are
organised and announced using the [Fedora calendar
(fedocal)](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar). &#42; The [Fedora
project wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora) provides
a place for temporary note taking. &#42; The [Fedora
magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org) posts Fedora related information
for end-users. &#42; The [Community
blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/) posts Fedora related
information for the community. &#42; The [Fedora
planet](http://fedoraplanet.org/) aggregates blogs from the complete
Fedora community. &#42; Notifications are generated using [Fedmsg
(Federated message bus)](http://fedmsg.com/) and can be searched using
[datagrepper](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/).

### Troubleshooting {#_troubleshooting}

&#42; Text can be pasted and shared using the [Fedora pastebin (a
modernpaste instance)](https://paste.fedoraproject.org/). &#42;
[fpaste](https://pagure.io/fpaste) provides a convenient command line
tool to paste information to the Fedora pastebin. &#42; [Ask Fedora (a
Discourse instance)](https://ask.fedoraproject.org) provides a forum for
troubleshooting.

### Packages and software {#_packages_and_software}

&#42; The [Fedora Packager
Dashboard](https://packager-dashboard.fedoraproject.org/dashboard?groups=neuro-sig)
provides an excellent overview of the state of packages. &#42; The
sources ([rpm spec
files](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-rpm-packages/index.html))
for packages live on [Fedora package sources (a Pagure
instance)](https://src.fedoraproject.org/dashboard/projects). &#42;
Packages are built using the [Fedora buildsystem
(Koji)](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/). &#42; Packages go through
the [Koschei Continuous Integration (CI)
system](https://koschei.fedoraproject.org/groups/neuro-sig) to ensure
that their dependencies are all correct. &#42; Packages are tested
(Quality Assurance: QA) on the [Fedora updates system
(Bodhi)](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/). &#42; Packages are
distributed globally using the [Fedora mirror
manager](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mirrormanager/). &#42; Packages
are monitored for updates using [release-monitoring.org
(Anitya)](https://release-monitoring.org/). &#42;
[Reviews](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Package_Review_Process/),
[bugs, and feature
requests](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/)
related to these packages are filed on [Redhat Bugzilla
instance](https://bugzilla.redhat.com). &#42;&#42; The list of currently
open bugs can be seen [here](https://tinyurl.com/neurofedora-bugs).
&#42;&#42; Review tickets can be searched using the [Fedora review
tracker](https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/). &#42; Extra
packages are provided via [the COPR build
system](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/). &#42; Docker images are
distributed using the [Fedora docker
registry](https://registry.fedoraproject.org/).

### Documentation {#_documentation}

&#42; The [asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/) sources for the documentation
are kept in a [Pagure
repository](https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/documentation). &#42; The
documentation is generated using an [Antora](https://antora.org/) system
and hosted at the [Fedora documentation
site](https://docs.fedoraproject.org).

## Contributor roles {#_contributor_roles}

There are various roles in which you can contribute to NeuroFedora. For
a complete description of contributor roles in the Fedora community,
please refer to this [wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join).

The NeuroFedora team are happy to help new members join the Fedora
community, and to learn the skills necessary to contribute. Please get
in touch with us using one of the communications channels!

The Fedora Join SIG also helps newcomers start with contributing to
Fedora. Take a look at [their
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/join/&#35;_not_sure_where_to_start_come_hang_out_with_us).

### Suggest software for inclusion {#_suggest_software_for_inclusion}

If there's more useful Free software out there that is not yet in
NeuroFedora, you can bring it to our attention. You can do so using [our
suggestion form](https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1).

### Package and maintain software {#_package_and_maintain_software}

Making packages available in the Fedora repositories requires the team
to build them from source to produce RPMs. These RPMs are then made
available in the Fedora repositories for all Fedora users to easily
install on their systems using &#96;dnf&#96;. They can also be used to
easily create [container images](containers.xml) that users can run with
Podman (or Docker). You can help the team by becoming a [Fedora package
maintainer](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Joining_the_Package_Maintainers/).

#### EPEL support {#_epel_support}

Read more about Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)
[here](epel::index.xml).

We primarily focus on Fedora branches. If you need a certain package
that is (co-)maintained by us in Enterprise Linux (EL), please file a
bug against that package, mentioning which epel branch you require and
we'll see what we can do depending on time and capacity.

If you are already a packager, we are happy to add you as a
co-maintainer, so you can take care of porting to any or all EPEL
branches.

### Test packaged software {#_test_packaged_software}

Packages that we provide must go through the [Fedora Quality Assurance
(QA)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA) process. You can simply enable
the updates-testing repository and help by [testing
updates](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing).

### File bugs and report general issues {#_file_bugs_and_report_general_issues}

Any bugs with the software include in NeuroFedora should ideally be
reported to the [Fedora Bugzilla
instance](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/). You will need a
[bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi) or
[Fedora](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/user/new) account to
do so. [This
page](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/)
provides step by step instructions on filing bugs.

Any other issues related to NeuroFedora [should be filed at our Pagure
project instance](https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/new_issue).

### Improve documentation {#_improve_documentation}

User documentation is a most important resource. You can help by
[improving or contributing to our
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-docs/contributing/).
You can improve pre-existing pages by clicking on the \'Edit this page\'
in the top right corner. The sources are kept
[here](https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/documentation).

We are also always looking for people to write about NeuroFedora, the
tools, community, and neuroscience on the [NeuroFedora
blog](https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/).

### Help other users {#_help_other_users}

We've set up [communication channels](#_communicating_and_getting_help)
to help users troubleshoot issues and get help. You can help by
remaining present in the communication channels and answering users\'
questions.

### Spread the word {#_spread_the_word}

Help us spread the word! Write about NeuroFedora, share your opinions on
social media, help more people learn about the project and get involved!

&#42; On Mastodon, we use the
[&#35;NeuroFedora](https://fosstodon.org/tags/neurofedora) hash tag.
&#42; On Twitter, we are
[\@NeuroFedora](https://twitter.com/NeuroFedora). &#42; You can order
NeuroFedora stikers off stickermule [using the approved

# Using software included in NeuroFedora {#_using_software_included_in_neurofedora}

NeuroFedora is a set of packages that can be installed on a Fedora
system. So, one can setup a Fedora system and then install whatever
tools they use. Fedora provides a variety of installation media:

&#42; We suggest the [Fedora
workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) as a well designed
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) based installation. &#42; For headless
(such as clusters and servers without a graphical interface)
installations, we suggest the [Fedora
server](https://getfedora.org/en/server/) installation. &#42; Users that
prefer other desktop environments, such as [KDE](https://www.kde.org/),
[XFCE](https://xfce.org/), [LXQT](https://lxqt.org/about/),
[Mate](https://mate-desktop.org/),
[Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)) or
[LXDE](https://lxde.org/), can select a [Fedora
spin](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/). &#42; The [Fedora
scientific](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/) image
provides a KDE based installation that includes various generally used
scientific tools.

Detailed information on installing Fedora can be found in the [Fedora
documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/).

## Software provided by NeuroFedora {#_software_provided_by_neurofedora}

:::: note
::: title
:::

More software is regularly being added to NeuroFedora. Please [get in
touch with us](communicating.xml) for specific requests.
::::

Users have access to the [complete set of software maintained by the
Fedora community](installing-software.xml). The NeuroFedora special
interest group (SIG), however, focusses on providing software for:

&#42; [computational neuroscience](compneuro-tools.xml) &#42;
[neuro-imaging](imaging-tools.xml) &#42;
[data-analysis](analysis-tools.xml) &#42; [our digital goodie box of
assorted tools](utilities.xml)

Please use the individual pages to learn more.

### Extra software (COPR) {#_extra_software_copr}

Free/Open source software that is harder to include in Fedora (usually
because it is developed in a way that makes it difficult to package
while implementing the Fedora packaging guidelines) is temporarily
provided in an [extra COPR repository](copr.xml). The NeuroFedora team
will continue to work with upstreams to move it to official Fedora
repositories.

## Container images {#_container_images}

Use of containers is discussed on a [separate page](containers.xml).

# Software for computational neuroscience {#_software_for_computational_neuroscience}

## Upstream packages {#_upstream_packages}

The following tools are among the software currently tested in
NeuroFedora and can be installed directly from upstream forges (e.g.
PyPi). You can see the tests results
[here](https://ankursinha.fedorapeople.org/neurofedora/package-status/latest/).

# Extra software: COPR {#_extra_software_copr_2}

Free/Open source software that is harder to include in Fedora (usually
because it is developed in a way that makes it difficult to package
while implementing the Fedora packaging guidelines) is temporarily
provided in an [extra COPR
repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/neurofedora/neurofedora-extra/).
The NeuroFedora team will continue to work with upstreams to move this
software to official Fedora repositories. In the meantime, users can
enable this COPR repository by running the following command in a
terminal:

``` bash
sudo dnf copr enable @neurofedora/neurofedora-extra
```

Once the COPR repository has been enabled, it acts like another Fedora
repository. Users can then continue to install software using DNF.

Software in COPR does not go through the usual Fedora QA channels.
However, the NeuroFedora team will thoroughly test this software before
making it available. The sources for building these packages can be
found on [Pagure](https://pagure.io/projects/neuro-sig/%2A).

# LaTeX {#_latex}

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a typesetting system that is
Free software. It is the standard for the communication and publishing
of scientific documents. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) provides
a convenient interface for collaborative writing using
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

## Installing LaTeX packages {#_installing_latex_packages}

Fedora includes the most recent [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
[TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution.
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) packages can be installed using
[DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html).

You can install a standard set of [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
packages using one of the provided schemes:

``` bash
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-basic
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-medium
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```

Individual [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) packages can also be
installed as required:

``` bash
sudo dnf install 'tex(beamer.cls)' \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;
sudo dnf install 'tex(hyperref.sty)' \&#35; \&lt;2\&gt;
```

&lt;1&gt; Install the beamer class. &lt;2&gt; Install the hyperref
package.

## Utilities {#_utilities_2}

A number of utilities are also available to aid with LaTeX writing:

## Getting help {#_getting_help}

Apart from the [usual Fedora
troubleshooting](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help)
channels, the [TeX user group](http://tug.org/) provides various
channels for troubleshooting, including a [mailing
list](http://lists.tug.org/texhax), a [web
forum](http://latex-community.org/forum/), a
[stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) website. Joining TUG has
a number of benefits\-\--consider joining them!

The [LaTeX wiki book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) works as an
excellent reference, while
[Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a most handy
tool for finding commands for various LaTeX symbols.

&#42; How do I = Citing NeuroFedora

Please cite NeuroFedora if you rely on the work we do. This helps us get
an idea of how NeuroFedora is being used:

&#96;&#96;&#96; \@Article{NeuroFedora2019, author = {Sinha, Ankur and
Bazan, Luis and Segundo, Luis M. and J\\k{e}drzejewski-Szmek, Zbigniew
and Kellner, Christian J. and Pascual, Sergio and Trande, Antonio and
Mangaonkar, Manas and Hlaváčková, Tereza and Hough, Morgan and Gradina,
Ilya and Gnatenko, Igor}, title = {NeuroFedora: a ready to use Free/Open
Source platform for Neuroscientists}, journaltitle = {BMC Neuroscience},
issn = {1471-2202}, url = {https://neuro.fedoraproject.org}, volume =
{20}, journal = {BMC Neuroscience}, publisher = {BioMed Central}, year =
{2019}, } &#96;&#96;&#96;

# Finding and installing software {#_finding_and_installing_software}

You can search the complete set of software available in Fedora using
the [Fedora packages application](https://packages.fedoraproject.org).
Fedora platforms include the default package manager,
[DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html), which can
also be used to search the packages provided in the Fedora repositories:

``` bash
sudo dnf search \&lt;search text\&gt;
```

Software can be installed using the
[DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html) package
manager:

``` bash
sudo dnf install \&lt;package name\&gt; \&#35; \&lt;1\&gt;
```

&lt;1&gt; The name of the package.

Detailed information on installing specific software where needed is
documented on independent pages linked in the side bar. A complete list
of software maintained by the NeuroFedora SIG can be found
[here](https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig). If you use
Free/Open source software that is not included in Fedora, you can
[suggest more software for inclusion in
NeuroFedora](overview.adoc&#35;_suggest_software_for_inclusion).

## Flatpaks {#_flatpaks}

Users can also use sanboxed applications using
[Flatpaks](https://flatpak.org/) on Fedora. Please refer to
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/home) to see what software is available
using Flatpaks.

# Using containers (Docker/Podman) {#_using_containers_dockerpodman}

Since the NeuroFedora packages are available in the Fedora repositories,
they can also be used in customised containers using the Fedora base
containers. The Fedora community release container images for all Fedora
releases which can be obtained from standard public container image
registries like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/fedora).

These containers can be used with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or
[Podman](https://podman.io/).

Podman is a replacement for Docker that does not require administrative
access. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Docker in a majority
of cases. On a Fedora system, Podman can be installed using
&#96;dnf&#96;.

``` console
sudo dnf install podman
```

To use Docker, please refer to the [Docker
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/). Fedora
also includes the [Toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox)
software, which allows the use of containerised command line
environments. Toolbox can be installed using &#96;dnf&#96;:

``` console
sudo dnf install toolbox
```

You can learn more about it on the [Fedora Silverblue documentation
page](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/).

## Using the Fedora release containers interactively {#_using_the_fedora_release_containers_interactively}

Even though the CompNeuro container image includes a plethora of tools
for computational neuroscience, any package from the Fedora repositories
can be used in a container by using the base Fedora release containers.
A simple example of using a Fedora container to use a NeuroFedora
package is shown below. Here, we use the Fedora base container image,
install the required package, and test that it works.

First, we pull the base Fedora container image:

``` console
podman pull fedora:latest

Resolved short name 'fedora' to a recorded short-name alias (origin: /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf)
Trying to pull registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest\&#8230;
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 8fde7942e775 [--------------------------------------] 0.0b / 0.0b
Copying config 79fd58dc76 done
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
79fd58dc76113dac76a120f22cadecc3b2d1794b414f90ea368cf66096700053
```

We then run the image interactively.

``` console
podman run -it fedora:latest /bin/bash


\&#35; terminal in the container
[root@95b9db71272f /]\&#35;
```

This gives us a container that we can work with interactively. We can
install a package here as we would on a Fedora installation, for
example:

``` console
[root@95b9db71272f /]\&#35; sudo dnf install python3-nest

Last metadata expiration check: 0:06:14 ago on Wed Jan  6 10:41:28 2021.

We can then run commands normally:

## Creating container images {#_creating_container_images}

While working interactively is quite useful, it is even more useful to
create container images with specific sets of packages that can then be
used and re-used regularly. For reproducible research, for example, a
container image that includes all the necessary software and sources for
the model, its simulation, and the analysis of the generated data is
most useful.

A container image can be created using a standard Containerfile
(Dockerfile for Docker). The complete reference for the
Containerfile/Dockerfile can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

Let us create an example container that runs this short code-snippet.

``` python
\&#35;!/usr/bin/env python3
\&#35; example Python source file
\&#35; saved in the current directory as nest-test.py
import nest

nest.version()
```

Our simple Containerfile looks like this:

``` dockerfile
FROM fedora:33 as fedora-33

\&#35; Install the required packages, in this case: NEST
RUN sudo dnf install python3-nest -y

COPY nest-test.py .

\&#35; Default command to run
CMD ['python', 'nest-test.py']
```

We can then build our container image:

``` console
ls
Containerfile  nest-test.py

podman build -f Containerfile  -t neurofedora/nest-test

STEP 1: FROM fedora:33 AS fedora-33
STEP 2: RUN sudo dnf install python3-nest -y
Fedora 33 openh264 (From Cisco) - x86_64        1.9 kB/s | 2.5 kB     00:01
\&#8230;.
Complete!
--\&gt; 2efea29a8db
STEP 3: COPY nest-test.py .
--\&gt; b23a5c6f90d
STEP 4: CMD ['python3', 'nest-test.py']
STEP 5: COMMIT neurofedora/nest-test
--\&gt; da9240e572b
da9240e572b4c08ac010001cbc15cb81ae879c63dca70afa4b3e6f313254b218
```

Our image is now ready to use:

``` console
$ podman image list
REPOSITORY                         TAG              IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
localhost/neurofedora/nest-test    latest           da9240e572b4  17 seconds ago  911 MB
```

When run, it runs our simple script:

``` console
$ podman run neurofedora/nest-test
[INFO] [2021.1.6 11:36:36 /builddir/build/BUILD/nest-simulator-2.20.1/nest-simulator-2.20.1/nestkernel/rng_manager.cpp:217 @ Network::create_rngs_] : Creating default RNGs

In a similar way, any package from the Fedora repositories can be used
in containers using &#96;dnf&#96; (not just NeuroFedora packages).
Additionally, we can also include software using &#96;pip&#96; and other
package managers, just as we would on a normal system.

# Using MPI (Message Passing Interface) on Fedora {#_using_mpi_message_passing_interface_on_fedora}

Where supported, software in NeuroFedora is also built with
[MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) support. Fedora includes
[MPICH](http://www.mpich.org/) and [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
implementations of [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/). Software can be
used with either of these, or without any
[MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) support (if a non
[MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) version is available).

Software built with [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) is provided as
separate packages for each [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/)
implementation:

    \&lt;software\&gt;-mpich
    \&lt;software\&gt;-openmpi

These packages can be installed using
[DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html) in the same
way as normal packages.

Binaries provided by the software, if any, will also be suffixed to
clearly mark which implementation of [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/)
is in use:

    \&lt;binary\&gt;_mpich
    \&lt;binary\&gt;_mpi

For example, NEST is provided as:

    nest-mpich
    nest-openmpi

and the binaries in these are respectively named:

    nest_mpich
    nest_openmpi

## MPI Environment modules {#_mpi_environment_modules}

To use an MPI build, the appropriate [environment
module](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) must be loaded. These
correctly setup paths, and environment variables. For MPICH builds:

``` bash
module load mpi/mpich-$arch \&#35; $arch is the architecture, for example x86_64
```

For OpenMPI builds:

``` bash
module load mpi/openmpi-$arch \&#35; $arch is the architecture, for example x86_64
```

The architecture can be obtained using the &#96;uname&#96; command in a
terminal:

``` bash
uname -m
```

It is generally easier to add these lines to the &#96;\~/.bashrc&#96;
file (for bash users) so that these commands are automatically run on
each login.

Where required, use of software with [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/)
is documented on a separate page.
