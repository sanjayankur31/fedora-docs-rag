Welcome to Ask Fedora! This is a community supported Discourse instance
for Fedora users to get help with any issues they may have with their
Fedora, As a new user, we hope you will find this site intuitive and
clearly structured, but here is some guidance to get you started:

Here are some very basic terms that will be helpful to keep in mind as
you use the Site:

- Topic: or ´thread´ The collection of messages grouped together.

- Post: Each element of a topic is referred to as a post.

- Original Post (or OP): The first post in any topic.

- User: Registered Users.

- Moderator : Keep The Site Clean and Organized.

- Admin : Do Administrative Tasks

- Category (Level-1): The Language that we can support. it's there for
  organization only. Topic requires Moderation. (Parent Category)

- Sub-Categiory (Level-2) : The place Where the Magic Occurs. (Child
  Category)

Before you start your Journey in the forum, you should set some config
in your Preference :

We are running a multi-lingual-site on Discourse, one of the first step
One User should do is mute the categories/sub-category to which you are
not interested in receiving any type of messages from the system and be
able to take full advantage of the system.

As a User you don't like see any messages about :

- A new messages from other languages

- Topic or Wharever other than you're not trackere and any kind of noisy
  or disturb with any other (category/sub-category)...​

for example (any other than your language or another that you're
insteresting, for example (your language and English).

What you Should DO? Muted these categories/sub-categories in your
personal profile GO → Preference → Categories → (Muted).

You are also able to change the Theme althought the default language in
the Site is English, you can change it to your mother language.

:::: important

You can mute as many as you like.

Where're Running a Multi-lingual Site and We Sructuture it as follow :

- Category Level-1 is The language Itself, and It there for
  Organizational purpose. Topic here requires Moderation.

Next, sub-categories Level-2, that are identical for all supported
languages.

- on Using Fedora

- on Installing or Upgrading Fedora

:::: note

Select the proper Sub-Category Will Help us to Help you better and Kept
the site Clean and On-Topic.

Badges in Discourse reinforce positive user behaviour and facilitates
"learning by doing".

By default, the Discourse homepage will show all Latest conversations in
the community but you can filter this list in a number of ways:

by category: in the menu line, click the 'all categories' title and a
list of all the categories appears.

By tag: in the menu line, click the 'all tags' title and a list of all
the tags are used will appear.

By level of activity: if you click on 'Top' the conversation topics will
be listed in order of most activity (views and replies) for a specific
time period. You can choose whether this is for all time, or select a
specific period such as quarter, month, week or just today.

By what's 'New' to you: by default, new topics are those created in the
last 2 days that you have not opened yet to keep the list fresh and
relevant. New topics show a small blue dot next to the topic title

By what topics are "Unread": by default, unread topics are those that
you have previously opened and read for at least 4 minutes, and that
have new posts (replies) submitted to them. Unread topics show a number
in a blue circle indicating how many new posts are in the topic.

There are several ways to see who is involved in topics.

On the homepage you will see a selection of avatars (profile pictures)
of:

- the user who started the topic (always the first photo);

- a selection of the most active participants;

- and, who created the most recent post (usually the last photo).

- in some cases, the first photo has a blue border or blue halo to
  indicate that the original poster is also the most recent poster

The box at the bottom of the OP tells you; who created the post and
when, gives a count of the replies and views in this topic to date, and
a display of the avatars of the most frequent participants.

![participating](participating.png)

For Search, the Menu, or your User page, use the icon buttons at the
upper right .

![navigation tool](navigation-tool.png)

A healthy community needs members to be posting new content, but this
activity is not everything. Readers are the true indicators of how
healthy the community is. What's the point of posts that no-one reads?
Discourse encourages and tracks reading habits so community managers can
keep a healthy balance.

Click a topic title and read down the list of replies in chronological
order, following links or previewing replies and quotes as you go. Use
your mouse to scroll the screen, or use the timeline scroll bar on the
right which also shows you how far through the conversation you've read.
On smaller screens, select the bottom progress bar to expand it.

- Selecting a topic title will take you to your last read post in the
  topic. To enter at the top ↑ or bottom ↓ instead, click the reply
  count or last reply date.

- Topics above the light red line on a list are new or updated since
  your last visit. If you have read all the way to the end of a topic,
  the title will be light grey instead of black.

Sometimes conversations are clearer if topics are split, where posts are
moved to a more appropriate topic, or two related topics are merged. If
a post is moved, a link will appear that will allow readers to jump to
that comment wherever it has been moved to, and the person who posted it
will also be notified.

At the end of the OP you will also see lists of related topics that link
to the one you are reading

![summarize](summarize.png)

Press any image Reply button to open the editor panel at the bottom of
your browser. You can continue reading (and even search or navigate to
different topics) while you compose your reply.

![replying](replying.png)

Discourse shows all posts in the order they are published. It does not
make you chase down multiple threaded paths. However, it still gives you
lots of ways to follow the context of conversations.

To reply to a specific post in a topic, clicking the grey Reply button
at the end of each post and your reply is linked to that post.

- If your reply is the next one published after the post you are
  replying to, this will appear next in chronological order

- If yours is NOT next, then two things happen after your post is
  published:

  - Your post will include a new link in its header with an image to
    show what this is 'in reply to' - clicking this link displays that
    previous post for context next to your reply

  - The original post includes a count of replies at the bottom -
    clicking this link displays the content of the

Drafts will automatically be saved as you write. If you minimise the
editor or navigate to a different topic, the editor might disappear. To
open a draft, return to the topic you were replying to or click the
highlighted bar at the bottom of your browser, and the editor will
reappear with your draft.

To insert a quote, select the text you wish to quote, then press the
Quote button that pops up. There is no need to quote the a whole
message, it helps to be specific. Repeat this for multiple quotes even
from different posts and different users. The quoted text will point to
their original source.

To notify someone about your reply, mention their name. Type @ to begin
selecting a username. This search will also search the name fields in
case you don't know a particular username.

To use standard Emoji 8, just type : to match by name, or traditional
smileys ;)

![emoji](emoji.png)

Alternatively, click on more to see a complete list of emoji to select
from.

What do we mean by "Onebox"?

That converts your web links into useful preview windows that inform
readers about the target before clicking.

How does it work?

The process is easy: Paste a URL into a post, and that link is converted
into a preview window

- start a post

- grab the URL you want to link to

- paste this on a new line with no spaces before

- magic happens

To generate a summary for a link, paste it on a line by itself. To start
a topic with a link, paste the link into the title field.

![onebox](onebox.png)

Your reply can be formatted using simple HTML, BBCode, or Markdown 18:

    This is <b>bold</b>.
    This is [b]bold[/b].
    This is **bold**.

For more formatting tips, [Try This
Tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

There are action buttons at the bottom of each post:

![action](action.png)

- To let someone know that you enjoyed and appreciated their post, use
  the like button. Share the love! (we `encourage to use This`).

- Grab a copy-pasteable (permalink) link to any reply or topic via the
  link button.

- Use the ... button to reveal more actions. Flag to privately let the
  author, or the site staff, know about a problem. Bookmark to find this
  post later on your profile page.

- Mark a TOPIC as SOLVED.

When someone is talking directly to you --- by replying to you, quoting
your post, mentioning your \@username , or even linking to your post, a
blue number will immediately appear over your profile picture at the top
right.

When you have been sent a Personal Message you will receive this in your
Inbox and a green number will appear over your profile picture to the
left.

Click your profile image to scroll through all your notifications .

![notification](notification.png)

You can optionally receive all these notifications as push notifications
to your desktop browser or Android device. Simply allow the site to send
you notifications through your browser when it asks permission.

Don't worry about missing a reply -- you'll be emailed any notifications
that arrive when you are away.

If you want, you can get notified about other things happening on the
site as well, either at the category or topic level.

You can change your notification level for any individual topic via the
notification control at the bottom, and right hand side, of each topic.

![topic](topic.png)

Notification level can also be set per category. To change any of these
defaults, see your user preferences, or visit the category page, and use
the notification control above the topic list, on the right side.

Based and Adapted from the Guide → [Discourse New User
Guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-guide/96331), if
you don't feel confortable/agree with this content feel free to adap it
and updating. :experimental: :toc:
::::

It's your role to help oversee the forum, ensuring that users and
content are in line with FEDORA rules, guidelines and [code of
conduct](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/index.html).
The system comes with numerous tools to help you to accomplish this.

# Moderator responsibilities and guidelines {#_moderator_responsibilities_and_guidelines}

- Ensure Ask Fedora is free of spam. With only FAS login enabled, there
  should not be much spam on the forum.

- All questions, answers and comments must follow the Fedora code of
  conduct.

- Encourage users to be helpful and participate actively.

- Remind users of the guidelines listed above.

- Ensure that questions are tagged appropriately.

- Delete duplicate questions if they are exactly the same and have been
  posted by mistake.

- If questions are very similar in content, you may close the duplicate
  question but MUST leave a comment pointing to the original question.

- Do not close questions just because they are answered. Leave it open
  unless there are special circumstances that warrant closing.

Some common scenarios you can see and how each ones can be handled:

Here are some very basic terms that will be helpful :

- Topic: or ´thread´ The collection of messages grouped together.

- Post: Each element of a topic is referred to as a post.

- Original Post (or OP): The first post in any topic.

- User: Registered Users.

When you notice a new user on the site (evidenced by a light-grey
username instead of dark-grey, which shows that a user is Trust Level
0), say hi and welcome them to the site.

Every User should Read the Start Here! first before Begin their
Journey...​

- Verify that the user does not belong to any fedora team and is a real
  Spammer with any of the scripts that the fedora team provides →
  <https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/blob/master/f/scripts>

- Open a Ticket in Fedora Infra TEAM →
  <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/new_issue>

- Issue Ticket : Spamm Account in AskFedora

- Text of the Ticket :

<!-- -->

    People use their FAS in ask.fedoraproject.org for Spamming, the System Detect the following Account/s for the same reason, so we proceeded to delete that one/s there:

    Bio

    Could you Please delete/Block the Respective Account/s in -> FAS (Fedora Account System)…

Some users, will go above and beyond what is expected. It is to your
advantage to recognize these users and encourage them to keep doing what
they do. Active helpful users may reach TL3, which allows them to help
edit titles and change topic categories. Users can also be manually
promoted to TL4, which grants them global edit privileges on any topic
or post they can see.

- [Understanding User Truts
  Level](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/)

The System maintains information on all users who register and interact
with the site.

You can get an overview of a user from their public profile. To access a
profile click the user's avatar or username in a topic, their avatar in
the topic list, or search for them. Above their profile is a count of
official warnings, suspensions, flags received, and helpful flags given
by the user. Just below are details on the user's account: when they
last visited, posted, and registered. You can review all public activity
by the user, as well as review the notifications they received.

You can also view and modify the user's preferences. This can be very
helpful if a user is reporting an issue with their account that you
suspect may be related to a preference change.

From a user's public profile you can access the user's Admin page. The
Admin page can also be accessed from the hamburger menu, and then by
clicking on Users. There you can search for users by username, email, or
full name. Once opened, you can review additional details about the
user, including non-public information like their registration and
last-used IP address. IP information can be helpful if a user appears
suspicious or acts too similar to another user. IP lookups are completed
locally, no data is sent outside the server. As mentioned in "The
Difficult User" section, this is also where users can be silenced, and
their trust level adjusted.

![User Panel](User-Panel.png)

Discussion takes place inside of topics. Each topic has a title and
category, and it is important that the discussion within relates to the
title/category.

If Topic has poor title or select the wrong category, you can edit the
topic to update one or both. Scroll to the top of the topic and click
the pencil next to the title.

![Complicated Topics](Complicated-Topics.png)

If the posts in the duplicate topic add to the discussion, they can be
moved to the existing one. Moving all posts in a topic will
automatically close the topic Just Select all and you can Delete/Move.

![Off Topic](Off-Topic.png)

If discussion in a topic is no longer productive/focused, moderators
should step in, Make a staff post. Many times, a simple reminder is
enough to solve the issue. You can create a post reminding users to be
polite, warn them they're talking in circles, etc, and then use the post
admin wrench to mark the post a staff post. This indicates to users that
the post is the official position of the site.

![Heated](Heated.png)

If the staff post doesn't help, or discussion seems so heated that a
reminder won't help, you can "pause" the topic. Use the topic admin
wrench to set a topic timer for auto-open. This will immediately close
the topic, preventing new posts, and display a notice when the topic
will reopen.

![Topic Timer](Topic-Timer.png)

Moderator's is not alone, are parts of a larger team. This team includes
other moderators, as well as site admins/owners, and in many cases
TL3/TL4 users. Regular and open communication between all should be
encouraged.

- **The Lounge:** Is a default category on installs restricted to users
  TL3 or above, is a great place for the moderator team to communicate
  with the site's trusted users. These users should be encouraged to
  share their thoughts and concerns with the site staff

- **The staff category:** Is default category on installs restricted to
  site staff: moderators and admins. The staff category is a great place
  for moderators to discuss what they're seeing and doing within the
  site, as well as to document internal policies and procedures.

- **Whispers:** When enabled in site settings, moderators can take
  advantage of whispers. Whispers allow staff to create private replies
  within an existing topic or PM. This allows moderators to discuss
  issues within the topic, so no context is lost. Whispers can also be
  used to mention other staff if assistance is required, but a public
  reply would be inappropriate, and an invite wouldn't provide the
  necessary context.

Please keep the site clean, appropriate, and on-topic via the Flag
system. When a topic or post is seen that does not belong, users and
moderators can flag it for review.

Flags can be your best friend. When a user doesn't like a post, they can
choose to flag it for moderators. The flag dialog has 5 options:

- message user (does not cause a flag, simply opens up the PM dialog),
  see send_an_official_warning discuss later in this chapter.

- off-topic.

- inappropriate.

- spam.

- something else.

Off-topic, inappropriate, and spam simply cast a flag, and the user is
done. Something else allows for a custom message and then casts the
flag. Once a flag is in the queue, moderators will see a red
notification on the hamburger menu and can open the flag queue, you can
decide what to do about the flag :

- Agree, Agreeing with the flag signals that you confirm the post, You
  can then message the user to edit it (automated message, no option to
  customize), or delete the post.

- Disagre, Disagring with the flag says that the post is not an issue.

- Ignore, Means the flag doesn't need further action.

For example, a user might flag their own post if they need help with
something. You would then ignore the flag so it doesn't hurt their trust
level. Agreeing will hurt their trust because their post was flagged,
disagreeing may eventually hurt it because a moderator disagreed with
their flag (disagree trust level impact is not developed yet). If you
are ever uncertain about which option to choose, pick ignore and handle
the post manually.

:::: note
::: title
:::

that resolving a flag with a custom message will automatically generate
a PM to the user who flagged the post. If you pressed "Ignore" or
"Disagree", they will get a reply with "Thanks for letting us know.
We're looking into it.". If you "Agree" with a custom flag, the message
will instead say "Thanks for letting us know. We agree there is an issue
with the post and are looking into it." There is also a third version of
this message for when the post was deleted.
::::

Posts with 3 flags will be automatically hidden without waiting for
moderator action.

Flagging is an in-built moderation measure in Discourse, intended to
dissuade bad behavior and spam, as well as to promote civilised
discourse. If you want to raise an issue about a post without derailing
the topic at hand, the best course of action is usually to flag it.

Marking a post as Off-Topic, Inappropriate or Spam will trigger a
moderator notification so moderators may review the issue in their flag
queue. Furthermore, this also "casts a flag" on the post, which has
other consequences:

- A user whose posts have accumulated 5 flags can not reach TL3.

  - These flags do not revert, however for TL3 only flags within the
    last 100 days are counted.

  - Only flags that a staff member agrees with count towards this limit.
    If a staff member ignores or disagrees with a flag, it isn't counted
    as far as TL3 is concerned.

- A post with 3 flags will be automatically hidden. Users may
  click-to-view the post.

  - A staff member can use the "Take Action" button, which will cause
    this to happen immediately.

  - When a post is automatically hidden due to flags, the user receives
    a PM informing them their post was flagged. After 10 minutes, the
    user may edit their post and it will be unhidden.

If another 3 flags occur, the post will be hidden again and editing will
not unhide the post.

- A new (TL0) user whose post is flagged as spam 3 times from 3
  different users will have all their posts hidden as a result.

- If after 48 hours a flag is still in the flag queue without any action
  taken, an automatic PM will be sent to all moderators.

- A topic with 12 unresolved flags from at least 5 different users will
  be automatically closed until the moderators can intervene.

:::: note
::: title
:::

All values mentioned above are the default settings. They can be changed
by admins in site settings.
::::

By default, clicking the flag button will present a user with the
following options:

![Flag](Flag.png)

Most of the time, lags are easy to handle :

- The post is clearly spam

- A user needs some help, etc.

Sometimes the issue can be harder to address. Maybe a user is
continually swearing in their posts and abusing others after being
warned. Maybe the request isn't easy to solve. In those cases, don't be
afraid to reach out to your fellow moderators, or the forum owners for
advice and support. Unless you are the only moderator, you shouldn't
ever feel like you have to make a decision on your own, that's why you
have a team. The auto-created staff category is a great place to have
discussion with you team in private. At the same time, don't hesitate to
make your own decisions - you were made a moderator because you are
trusted to do the right thing.

**What happens when you flag something?**

For a single flag, the post appears in the staff flag queue. Staff can
review the flag and choose which action to take, including hiding the
post, deleting the post, ignoring the flag, and more. For full details
on flag handling by staff, see the Discourse Moderation Guide.

If a post receives multiple flags before staff can handle it via the
flag queue:

1.  "Enough" trust level 1+ users must flag a post. By default this is 3
    flags, but 1 trust level 3-4 flag is needed if the post flagged is
    from a trust level 0 user. Remember that new trust level 0 users
    don't have the ability to flag.

2.  The post in question is immediately hidden:

    - the post author sees Your post was flagged by the community.
      Please see your messages.

    - the community sees This post was flagged by the community and is
      temporarily hidden. View hidden content.

    - staff sees the actual post, as posted, in a dimmed state to
      indicate it has been hidden for others.

3.  A very friendly private message is sent to the author of the post,
    describing what happened, in the friendliest imaginable language,
    and letting them know that for {flag type} a considered edit of any
    kind is enough to un-hide the post.

:::: note
::: title
:::

there is a bit of a "cooling off interval" where a post is hidden but
cannot be edited by its author. This is configurable, but is set to 10
minutes after reaching the flag threshold by default. As a weird side
note, this can open up very old posts, say 5 years old, to editing that
would not normally be editable because they are far beyond the default
allowed owner edit interval, which is 6 months.
::::

Now some what ifs.

- The post author edits, the post is un-hidden and nothing else happens:
  success! No harm no foul, and notably no formal moderators had to be
  around for this to work!

- The post author does not edit, does not appeal: the post is never
  un-hidden. If a post stays hidden for 30 days, it is automatically
  deleted.

- Moderator manually...

  - disagrees with flags Post is unhidden.

  - agrees with flags. Post stays hidden.

  - ignores flags. Nothing happens. Post stays hidden. Posts hidden for
    more than 30 days are automatically deleted.

If the same post is hidden a second round of flags, the flags must now
be manually handled by a moderator at that point, there is no automatic
unhiding through edit possible.

(Note that a repeated set of flags from the same folks over and over on
the same user should be discounted. We want a wide range of trusted
users to think a person's post is offensive, not the same people over
and over.)

The goal here is for the community to be able to protect itself from the
worst users, even without a moderator present. But it works even better
with a moderator, as the moderator can accelerate the process by
handling the appeals.

Or you could disable it altogether, and go back to a world where every
raised flag must be manually handled by an official mod, if that's how
you roll. But this is on by default.

- If a post is **clearly spam**, we flag it as spam. In this way the
  post will be hidden.

- If the user that created the post is crearly a fake user (i.e. there
  are no other legit

- If a post looks like spam, but we have **doubts** about the post, we
  warn the user using

  - If there are not answers or the user posts other spam content, we
    silence the user and

    - Eventually: suspend the user

AskFedora users can help in keeping the forum a spam free place by
flagging posts, In this way the moderators receive a report and can take
action.

If we spot that a silenced or suspended user spams other fedora
channels, then we will tell infra team in order to block the FAS
account.

If the moderators and admins have doubts and they would like to discuss
posts or actions to take, they can use the Staff category on AskFedora.

:::: note

On most forums difficult users are rare.
::::

However, you may encounter a user that just doesn't want to follow the
rules, is rude, posts inappropriate material, etc. How can you handle
them?. There may be instances where one of the steps doesn't make sense
or the action was so egregious that a step (or steps) are skipped.

First, try to avoid assuming that the user has a negative intent. They
may simply be ignorant of the rules, may not speak your forums language
well, may be young, or have another reason for the way they act.

Try to contact the user privately via PM to let them know what is wrong
with their behavior. Remember to talk about the negative behaviors -
don't attack the user themselves. When possible, link to existing rules,
guidelines, FAQs. In most cases, this contact will be enough. However,
if it is not...

You can make the message an \"official warning\". This PM will
automatically gain staff color, and a notice that the user has received
an official warning will appear on the user profile for other moderators
to see. In the official warning, be sure to explain the negative
behavior you have seen, detail specifically what you'd like them to do
instead, and the consequences of not changing their behavior.

Select The User and Click on Send a PM → then Click on Offical Warning

![Warning](Warning.png)

If the behavior continues, be sure to follow through with the listed
consequences. You may choose to :

Silenced users are prevented from creating new topics, posts, flags, or
PMs on the site. They are still able to complete other actions, like
\"liking\" posts, reading topics, replying to PMs, etc. Additionally,
they can communicate with moderators via PM, so you can continue to
communicate with them to try and address the behavior. Silencing a user
is done from the user's Admin page. To access it:

Navigate to the user's profile, click Admin, then click Silence.

![Silence User](Silence-User.png)

Enter the silence duration, a reason, and a message. When silencing a
user, explain to them what they need to do before they can be
unsilenced.

If the behavior still continues...
